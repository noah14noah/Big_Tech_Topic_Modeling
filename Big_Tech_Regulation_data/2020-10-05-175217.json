He will take you to the next hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Every day is a busy day, Charles.   Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAYNE:  All right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, French President Emmanuel Macron just landing  at Joint Base Andrews as he begins a three-day state visit hosted by  President Trump.  We're also keeping an eye on your money, of course, as  U.S. Treasury yields creep towards three percent, which is sparking new  fears of a bear market on Wall Street.  We shall see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish  Regan and on now to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump and Macron will look to strengthen their, well, bromance if  you like as both men have a lot riding on this week's visit where trade and  the Iran nuclear deal are set to dominate the agenda.  I'll be discussing  this with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, of course, North Korea says it will suspend all nuclear tests ahead  of its historic summit with South Korea.  President Trump tweeting this,  \"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work  out, and maybe they won't.  Only time will tell.\"  We have more on that  coming up.</p><p>Lots to talk about.  But, first, French President Emmanuel Macron as we say  just landing on American soil, now is making his way to Washington to meet  with President Trump.  Do we have Fox -- do we have -- he's good.  We have  Fox News's Doug McKelway.  He's at the White House with more on the big  state visit.</p><p>Doug.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Ashley.   President Macron touched down at Joint Base Andrews just within the past  hour.  And his motorcade as we speak is just pulled up to Blair House about  a block away he and the First Lady of France will stay there for the next  couple of hours before they come here to the White House, board a  helicopter with the first couple of the United States for a trip across the  Potomac River where they will dine at the George Washington's Mount Vernon  tonight before the first state dinner of the Trump administration which  takes place here at the White House tomorrow.</p><p>These two get along famously as best as we can tell that they came  evidently as early as last summer when President Trump went to Paris to  enjoy Bastille Day, and came away from that meeting, having a very close  personal relationship with Mr. Macron.  He also came away from that meeting  suggesting we have a military parade here in the United States.  That is  not to say that they're not considerable differences between the two  gentlemen.</p><p>May 12th, for example, is a deadline for Mr. Trump to decide whether to  lift sanctions on Iran.  The press secretary was asked about that just in  the briefing a few moments ago, which is now underway.  Here is what she  had to say, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  But what you do have  are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have  a great friendship.  Certainly, both have a great deal of interests in  doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and  candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders  have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before  either of these individuals arrived on the scene.  And we're going to  continue that relationship.  But I think we can expect this to be a very  productive and very positive state visit for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  She added that she does not want to get ahead of any discussions  that two might have before they actually occur.  Macron, however, does  believes that it would be a bad decision to get out of the Iran nuclear  deal.  Here's what he had to say this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  Is this agreement perfect and this  JCPOA perfect thing for our relationship with Iran?  No.  But for nuclear,  what do you have as a better option?  I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  And May 1st is another important deadline, a time for Mr. Trump  to decide whether he wants to impose tariffs on the European Union for its  importation of steel and aluminum.  Again, Mr. Macron thinks that would be  a bad idea for Mr. Trump to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make a trade your allies.  I'm very -- I'm an easy guy.   I'm very simple.  I'm straight forward.</p><p>It's too complicated if you make war against everybody.  You make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran.   Come on.  It doesn't work.  You need allies.  We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  The First Lady coming out of the shadows a little bit for this  state dinner tonight.  She is apparently behind all of the minute planning  of this first state dinner coming tomorrow night.  The first state dinner  of the Trump administration.</p><p>Ashley, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be quite an affair.  Doug McKelway at the White  House.  Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  My pleasure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Joining me now to talk about that and other issues, FormerArkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you, Governor.</p><p>You know what politics can makes for strange bedfellows, and here we have  maybe Mr. Trump's lone ally in Europe right now because he's had a public  spat with Theresa May and the U.K.  And here we have Emmanuel Macron, who  by all accounts is a political outsider who also managed to outwit the  political establishment in France.  So maybe it's not so strange that these  two individuals kind of get along?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, I think a lot of it has  to do with what you just mentioned.  They're both outsiders, but they're  also very plain-spoken people.  And they're honest with each other.  The  President likes that.  He really does.</p><p>For all those who think that he wants to be surrounded by yes men, they  don't know him very well.  He doesn't like to be ridiculed in public but he  does not mind having people in the meetings with him speak their mind.   Clearly, President Macron is able, willing to do that.  They have very  frank and open discussions.</p><p>And the good thing is, look at this.  I think it's the best relationship  we've seen with France in many years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And we didn't even have to bring James Taylor in to sing for it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I love the sarcasm.  It's an effective form of wit despite what  Stuart Varney says.  OK.  So, look, you know they're going to be talking,  Governor, about, you know, militarily ironically.</p><p>France has been right with the U.S., both against ISIS and in Syria.  But  then we have the nuke deal with Iran.  We have trade.  We have climate  change.</p><p>Can they get any common ground?  Because I don't think the President is  going to say, \"He's kind of hinted yes, OK, maybe we can get back into the  Paris climate accord.\"  I don't see that happening.  And with regard to the  Iran nuke deal, we heard Macron speaking this weekend.  It doesn't feel  like they're going to get any common ground there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  They maybe not, Ashley.  But I think that there is a likelihood  that there will be some compromise on both parties to bring something to  the table that works.  But the President has been very clear.  He's  President of the United States.</p><p>He doesn't capitulate to any other country.  He does what's best for  America.  And he expects every other world leader to do the exact same  thing for their country.</p><p>But if he can be convinced whether it's by Macron or one of the others that  this is really in the best interests of the United States I think he is  open to it.  But I'll be very clear to say, if it's not in the best  interests of the United States he's not interested at all.  This President  is not in simply trying to be popular with world leaders.  He wants to be  effective in making sure that he takes care of America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely true.  OK, we're gong to completely change gears.  Now  I want to ask you about this one.  Canadian country singer Shania Twain  issuing an apology after getting a lot of backlash for saying she would  have voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.</p><p>I mean, how could she say such a thing?  What are your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's so sad that the left refuses to allow anyone to speak his  or her mind without being just pilloried and excoriated unless they agree  with the left of center viewpoint that they hold.  This is the most  intolerant bunch of people I've ever seen in my life, Ashley, and this is a  great example.</p><p>You know, it's sad that Shania Twain felt like she had to apologize, but  the backlash that she got for simply expressing an opinion, why can't she  do that?  She ought to be able to.  Tragic day.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, exactly.  We've seen it, you know, certainly coming out of  Hollywood in the movie business.  No different, I guess, in the music  business as well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Too bad and it's unfortunate.  We need to be able to have the  kind of honest discussions that we're seeing between the French and  American President where we don't always agree but we do it respectfully.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very well-said.  Governor Huckabee, thank you so much for joining  us today.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets for you.  Stocks  just slightly lower as Wall Street kicks off its biggest week for corporate  earnings.  The Dow off 57 points, and we start lows earnings today with  Google after the closing bell today, or Alphabet, the parent company.</p><p>Let's get down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where our own  Nicole Petallides has the latest.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, good afternoon, Ashley.  So,  as you noted, we're watching for Google after the bell.  We're taking a  look at the broader market right now, and you do see all down arrows with  the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 64 points after some choppy  trading, down volume, slightly ahead of up volume.  And the Dow, the NASDAQ  and the S&amp;P all lower today, but for the month, in the green.</p><p>Interestingly enough, we've seen oil pulling just slightly higher now after  having being down.  But the dollar and Treasury yields have been a big  story, taking a look at 10-year Treasury, which on Friday was settling at  highest levels since January 2014.</p><p>Look at this, getting closer to that very psychological level of three  percent.  Two point ninety-eight percent right now for the 10-year bond  yield.  Of course, as that moves higher we'll watch for that.</p><p>Taking a look at the tech earnings, I want to get to that quickly.   AlphabetGoogle is slightly lower.  Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all  of these this week, it is going to be a huge week for tech earnings.  And I  spoke with Joel Kulina over at Wedbush and he basically said, clearly,  large cap tech has taking somewhat of a hit.  But most of the investors  will be looking at these, looking at the capital return announcements on  all of them.</p><p>And, of course, regulatory overhang for the names, such as Facebook and  Google.  They gave me a lot on each one of them.  We'll break it down  throughout each of the hits, but we'll see all down arrows right now,  Google after the bell.  We'll have to see it here.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Another busy week for you, Nicole.  Thank you so much.   Appreciate it.  Nicole, make sure to watch \"After the Bell,\" at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern today for the latest earnings report from Alphabet/Google right  here on Fox Business.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, we'll have more on these markets as, yes, as Nicole  said the 10-year Treasury yield is nearing at magical three percent.  Is it  magical or is it a nightmare?  We'll find out.</p><p>Plus, new questions about the Russia investigation.  House Intelligence  Chairman Devin Nunes revealing that there was no official intelligence used  to start that probe into the Trump campaign.  We'll have the intel later in  the show.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  A lot of breaking news to bring you right now.  Let's begin with  news from the Nashville Police Department, which says the suspect in the  Waffle House shooting there has been taken into custody just moments ago.   So that's an update there.</p><p>Meanwhile, north of the border, several people in Toronto had been hurt  after a white van reportedly plowed into a group of pedestrians.  The  extent of injuries on whether it was intentional or an accident is still  not known.  We're told that at least eight people are said to have been hit  by that white van.  Of course, we'll keep monitoring all of the stories and  bring you the very latest updates as they become available.</p><p>Let's get back to politics.  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announcing he  supports CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be the next Secretary of State,  tweeting this.  \"After meeting with Mike Pompeo, discussing his foreign  policy perspectives and considering his distinguished time as CIA Director  and his exemplary career in public service, I will vote to confirm Mike  Pompeo to be our next Secretary of State.\"</p><p>Now Manchin is the second Democrat to support Pompeo's nomination, possibly  giving him some momentum ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.  That panel, though, poised to vote against Pompeo.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this, American Progress Action Fund Larry Korb.   All right.  Larry, why this unprecedented rebuke of Mike Pompeo?  Is it  just purely obstructionism?  What's the play here?</p><p>LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND:  Well, I think a  lot of the people, including Republican Rand Paul are concerned that his  positions will reinforce President Trump's worst tendencies and they want  someone who will serve, you know, as a counterweight.  And I don't think  Director Pompeo has helped himself by not telling the members of the  committee off-line, you know, about his North Korean trip because this is  theoretically acting like a Secretary of State before you get there.  But,  as you pointed out, he will be confirmed.</p><p>And, you know, people talk about it.  People forget when Chuck Hagel,  Senator Hagel went up to be Secretary of Defense under President Obama, he  only got three Republican votes on the floor.  So this is not unprecedented  for people to use this to make another point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you could argue, Larry, that the point that Mr. Pompeo didn't  tell anyone or told the least amount of people possible is that it's a  chronic place for leaking information.  And there's one thing they didn't  want was for that visit to Pyongyang to come out before he went there and  came back.  And then we could talk about it, but he didn't want that to be  known to the general public.  And Washington is a place for leaks.</p><p>KORB:  No, but I think when he came back he should have briefed them off- line because, again, the worst thing you do -- well, I remember my own  experience, if you start acting like you got the job before you are  confirmed, a lot of people will not take that very well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So you do believe he'll get through the full Senate?</p><p>KORB:  I think he will because you've already got, at least two Democrats.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>KORB:  And so, I think he will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Could it unsettle the North Korean negotiations effort?  Is their  timing on this pretty poor?</p><p>KORB:  No, I don't think so.  And I think, you know, basically, his trip  was the right thing to do, or somebody should have gone, you know, to talk  to the North Koreans who lay the groundwork.  And today, over the weekend  we've seen some public back and forth, and I think once sensible thing the  administration has said is, they're not going to make any concessions just  because he stopped doing what he's doing.  He's going to have to start  dismantling stuff before we relax the economic sanctions.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that's going to be the key elements, one, nuke, you know,  dismantlement.  But, first, the timetable for the sanctions comes after  that, which really puts the ball in the court of North Korea.  I guess the  fact that we're talking is very positive, but we have to have a pretty  hefty amount of skepticism when we look at this as well.</p><p>KORB:  Yes.  I mean the North Koreans promised several times going back to  the 1990s that they're going to do something that they didn't do it.  So  you not only wanted to start dismantling it, you want to have intrusive  inspections much like we have, for example, in Iran where they can go in  and check and see that he's living up to the deal.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Do you think President Trump's unconventional approach, the  tweets, the \"rocket man\" references, all of that have kind of  discombobulated Pyongyang a little bit and that's what's got us to this  point?</p><p>KORB:  I think the key thing was the sanctions.  I give President Trump for  giving much tougher sanctions than we have before because we got the  international community, particularly the Chinese and Russians to go along.   Now, they may have been concerned that, you know, President Trump might do  something erratic.</p><p>But the fact in the matter those sanctions are starting to hurt, and that's  why he has stopped this program because he has gotten as far as he wants  to.  He has the capability.  The question is now, are you going to you  limit that capability.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Ten seconds, Larry.  Are you confident we can get something out  of this summit?</p><p>KORB:  I think we can because, again, I think the sanctions are beginning  to bite and I think that he recognizes that this is once in a lifetime  opportunity, not only with us, but a very liberal government in South  Korea.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good point.  Well, we shall see, as they say.  Larry Korb,  thank you so much.  Larry, appreciate it.</p><p>KORB:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets.  We're being down  slightly lower on the Dow.  We're off 85 points, now maybe getting a little  momentum on the downside.  We'll have more on the markets and what's moving  them on the intel right after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  We want to get back now to that story out of Toronto as we're  getting more information.  The driver of a white van, a white Ryder van  plowing into at least eight to 10 pedestrians on the sidewalk.  That driver  now in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind this.  Police say  the van apparently jumped the curb.  This is all happening as Cabinet  ministers from the G7 countries are gathered in Toronto right now ahead of  June summit in Quebec.</p><p>Eyewitnesses saying it appeared the driver did indeed deliberately tried to  hit people on the sidewalk.  But, again, we don't know what's the motive  for this yet, but the suspect is in custody.</p><p>Let's get back to the markets.  Stocks are at sessions lows as the 10-year  Treasury yield hovers right around its highest level in four years, now  closing in on three percent causing economists who worry about rising,  borrowing costs.</p><p>Joining me now is MaxFund.com Founder Jonas Ferris along with Surevest  Wealth Management CEO Rob Luna.</p><p>All right.  Jonas, let me begin with you.  Why is three percent on the 10- year such a psychological level?  Surely, we can handle three percent  because historically that's still really low?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOUNDER, MAXFUND.COM:  Historically it's low.  It is less  psychologically useful than like Dow 10,000 was technically meaningless and  20,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just a price index on stocks.  That's an arbitrary.  The  whole -- you know, you're borrowing money at these rates and you're  investing money at these rates.  So, like it means something to  institutional investors and retail investors.</p><p>You know, people might not take a mortgage if it breaks a certain threshold  in their head or a car loan.  That's why you see like 3.99 percent fines in  yields.  This is a meaningful threshold.  And a lot of buyers are coming in  at three.  And that's what happened for all of the last times you run up to  three over the last three years.</p><p>And a lot of demands for bonds when the rate gets a little higher.  It's  still low historically but it's a safe yield.  And, you know, the stock  market is high and it's very volatile as you've seen in recent months.</p><p>So there's been a lot of independent demand that comes in around three.   And maybe the government is selling hundreds of billions of dollars of debt  at this level, so we're very concerned, is it going to breach three and all  of a sudden it was going to panic and say, \"OK, the 30-year bull market in  Treasury is over and bonds is over?\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Then we go to 3.4, four, and that's when the real panic would  start.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Rob, I moved to the United States in 1982.  It was a  real steal if you got a mortgage for 16 percent.  So I have a hard time  panicking over this, but I get Jonas' point.  It's seems, Rob, that we're  trading in a range right now, especially with a perceived hawkish Fed in  background just waiting to raise rates.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Yes, and that's exactly it,  Ashley.  I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of the year.  And I  really expect that to continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>You know, I've been seeing for a while the easy money is done in this  market.  And investors really need to change their playbook if they're  going to be able to generate returns.  And quite honestly, importantly,  mitigate the risk in their portfolio.</p><p>You know, the idea of 60/40 buy and hold portfolio where bonds are expected  to be that buffer to cushion at the downside of stocks as we've already  seen this year is not working.  And some of the more conservative investors  are the one actually taking the brunt of the storm.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we're going to find out the latest earnings from the big  tech companies this week.  We kick it off after the bell today with Google.   If we have a blowout performance by these big, big technology companies how  much impetus does that give to the market?</p><p>FERRIS:  It's helpful.  We saw that with Netflix recently.  But I think  that -- there's still a lot of fear that the underlying business model of a  Google and Facebook, which is largely based on privacy -- looking to  privacy and selling it off to advertisers, is under the spotlight.  And the  more we learn about those behaviors, the more we're concerned that there's  going to be a regulatory crackdown or there's a consumer revolt.  And it's  going to limit the earnings growth potential of these companies.</p><p>Even with good numbers right now, I think there's a lot -- there's enough  fear baked into that side of the FANG so-called equation which is, again,  largely based on selling targeted advertising and more as we learn every  week, we think there's new revelation what they're doing with your data  when you're not getting logged in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just absurd.  So, I think that's going to keep them in it.   We have not seen Apple phone sales as strong as people would like.  So  there's a lot of pressure in tech.  And a good earnings report isn't going  to take that away at this point.</p><p>It will be helpful like it was in Netflix, but at this point there's long- term fears there and that's why the three percent Treasury yield is  starting to look comforting to people --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- in the world of maybe tech companies aren't going to grow as  fast as they have.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.  You know, Rob, we had an analyst on this morning on our  network who said the only thing that really worries him, he feels like  earnings are strong, the economy is humming along nicely, some sort of  geopolitical situation could really knock it off the axis.  Do you have  concerns like that?</p><p>LUNA:  Well, I mean, geopolitical concerns, Ashley, are always in our  outlook for the markets, and something that could happen at anytime.  So,  yes, if you see something like that, you know, I think part of the reason  we've calm down and we've had a positive month is because the rhetoric out  of North Korea is kind of calmed down quite a bit and we're starting to see  progress there.  So, if that starts to tick back up again, if earnings  don't come in that great, and you start to see this interest rates rise  above three percent, those are all going to provide headwinds for investors  in this market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we'll play the what if game.  What if the Democrats take  back the House, does that have impact on the market?  Perhaps the less  business-friendly House, would that have that have an impact?</p><p>FERRIS:  I don't think that's a current concern because it wouldn't lead to  like tax cuts.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  You're not going to automatically have higher corporate tax rate  just because there's a power change.  So there would have to be such a huge  swing for there anything that affect what the market liked, which was the  tax package in recent years.</p><p>I think, you know, there's a positive and negative going on right now.   These rates are going up because the economy is strong, partially because  of tax cuts.  So, it's not like it's all bad that rates are going up.  The  question is do they go up so fast that it's faster, or does the Fed raise  rates too high and causes recession?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  That's what kind of the fears.  But, again, there's an underlying  strength here that people want to invest in, which is why the stock market  is still strong.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  People don't want to miss what could be an even longer bull  market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, Rob, could the tax cuts kind of counteract the rising  interest rates?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, I think so.  And I think that's what where going to start  seeing, Ashley, out of companies as they're starting to report this  quarter.  And that's why expectations are so high for earnings.</p><p>But let's be careful, you know, I think Jeremy Siegel out of Lawrence  talked about this quite a bit, that a lot of this is going to be front-end  loaded.  You're getting this accelerated depreciation in assets.  But come  next year when all that sworn off, if companies can't generate good top- lines growth, I think you're going to see all of this taken back.</p><p>And I think investors are pretty smart that they're starting to look at  that now.  So even though companies are being in these expectations,  they're still a little bit skeptical if they're going to be able to  continue that especially in a rising interest rate environment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Jonas, it feels like we've lost the volatility that we  had just weeks ago where we were up 400, down another 500.  As I said to  Rob earlier on, we're now in this kind of a range which I think comforts  the average investor because that volatility can be very, you know, very  alarming.</p><p>FERRIS:  It was.  We had a few like eras of that since, but it's been, you  know, a pretty much non-stop, you know, bull market since early 2009.  So,  there's been, you know, there's the Greece problems of the debt bangs.   There's always been a volatility era.</p><p>Then it seems just go away when we go on to higher things.  But at this  point, it does seem like we're moving more sideways then we were going to  have to see that the economy can grow in spite so to say of higher rates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Because a lot of people also believe the opposite that rates are  going up because of the tax cuts possibly in a way to counter the benefit  of them.  And that's where we kind of watching for and, again, it's always  been the case where they raise rates too high.  Thinking the economy is too  hot, cause a recession.  You don't want to be sitting in a high P-E stock  portfolio when we go to next recession.  So that's kind of the fear.</p><p>And to your original point, you know, these home prices, when you are --  they need to be have mortgages --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- the home prices weren't based on having a three percent  mortgage.  So that's what's they've been concerned what happens when they  go back to six percent, because the home prices have to go right back down  to adjust to that or they're going to stay there --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good point.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- showing to the market right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, I hope we don't drop suddenly 500 points as I've just  said.  Anyway, Jonas and Rob, thank you so much gentlemen for --</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- talking about the markets with us.  Really appreciate it.</p><p>Let's get back now more on this breaking news out of Toronto as police say  a van hit at least eight people on the sidewalk, but any motive unknown at  this hour but we do know that the driver is in custody.</p><p>Fox News's Catherine Herridge, a native of Toronto, by the way, joins me  right now with more on this story.</p><p>Catherine, what are you hearing?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're  waiting for some indication from the police as to the motivation of the  suspect and the identification of the suspect.  But having covered Homeland  Security now for 18 years, I can tell you a number of things really stand  out to me about the incident.</p><p>Number one, for those at home who are not familiar with Toronto, Young  Street is the main north-south artery running through the city.  It starts  at Lake Ontario.  And then it travels up dozens of miles to Northern  Ontario.  I think it may in fact be the longest street running north-south  in the entire country of Canada.</p><p>And this intersection with Finch Avenue is one of the major east-west  arteries.  And it's also one of the major hubs for the subway system there  known as the TTC, the Toronto Transit Commission.</p><p>So you have one of the major arteries in the city.  You also have coupled  with that, the subway system and then you also have the time of day, 1:30.   This is when people are finishing up their lunch hour and heading back to  work.  And this area is not only a business area but it's a heavily  residential area.  There are a lot of large condominium complexes up in  that part of Toronto with sort of what I would call smaller residential  neighborhoods, older neighborhoods off to the side.</p><p>So if the individual's motivation was to inflict a maximum number of  casualties, they really kind of checked all the boxes in this particular  situation, you know, a major artery for traffic, vehicular and pedestrian  traffic in Toronto.  Also the subway system, the time of day, and based on  the eyewitness reports that we're getting out of Toronto, the driver of the  white van was driving north on Young Street and went up on to the curb and  hit the pedestrians.</p><p>So they would have hit the pedestrians if you will, coming from behind in  many cases and they would have been driving, sort of, up on that major part  of the artery on Young Street.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Catherine, you know, we've seen this played out in London, in  Barcelona, in Berlin to your point, a main thoroughfare being targeted.   But seeing from the helicopter shots, it appears to be a white Ryder van or  rental van, which really plays into the M.O. of these terrorists.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Well, I mean, there are a lot of circumstantial pieces here to  the puzzle that point towards that, but I want to just be a cautious and  responsible because we don't know --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  -- who the suspect is or what their motivation is.  But  certainly, the person who drove that van, and it appears to be a rental  van, did so in a part of the city at a time of day near a subway  intersection where they would have a maximum sort of impact if you will in  terms of casualties.  And I think that that was certainly have the  attention of police and investigators in Toronto.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely.  Catherine Herridge, thank you very much for your  insight into this.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We appreciate it.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And, of course, we will continue to follow with more details as  they become available in that incident in Toronto.</p><p>Devin Nunes says there was no official Intel to justify the Russian  investigation.  So how does a dossier funded by the opposition spur an FBI  probe?  We'll examine that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  So we've  long wanted to know what intelligence that you have that actually led to  this investigation?  So what we found now, after the investigators have  reviewed it is that, in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>We now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start  this investigation.  We know that Sidney Blumenthal and others were pushing  information into the State Department.  So we're trying to piece all of  that together.  And that's why we continue to look at the State Department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, what a tangled web we weave.  The man leading the House  Russian probe Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, right there  telling our Maria Bartiromo this weekend there was no intelligence used to  begin a probe into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  If  you're confused before, just to add to it now.</p><p>Joining me now, former Prosecutor David Bruno.  All right.  David, so to  Mr. Nunes' point, they applied for a FISA warrant based solely not as he  says on intel, no official intelligence.  But based on the dossier, the  information provided within that was funded by the Democratic National  Committee.  Correct?</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FMR. PROSECUTOR AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Well, correct.   And these are two different issues.  What Devin Nunes just talked about --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- is how the investigation was started.  We know that it was  started in July of 2016.  And it was started as a result of a conversation  that George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat.</p><p>WEBSTER:  In the bar?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right, right.  So, in the Schiff Minority memorandum on FISA, they  point to that.  They say it wasn't Steele that initiated investigation.  It  was the Papadopoulos information.  What we found out is that the  information about the Papadopoulos statements didn't come through normal  channels.  We would expect that it would come through these five eyes  agreement, which is a partnership with Australia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there are no reports, there's nothing to document that  information coming our way.  So the next question is, if it didn't come  through the proper channels --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Where did it come from?</p><p>BRUNO:  -- where did it come from?  That's what they're looking at.  That's  what important when it comes --</p><p>WEBSTER:  That you have a copy here, but it's redacted.  So we don't know  yet.</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  I have it and everyone is welcome to look at the Schiff FISA  memorandum.  It is a part of it where it says that wait a second, this is  not open based on Steele.  It's opened by the Papadopoulos information that  came from the Australians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen, let's talk about Steele because a lot was being  made of this.  He was actually terminated by the FBI even though the  information that he accumulated for them was used?</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  He was terminated for leaking stuff to the press, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there's arguments to be made that the information that he  provided to the press was also used in the FISA applications, which is  called circular reporting.  So the argument was made that, well, there's  press information that corroborates Steele, but Steele was the actual  source.  A lot to be made, let's not forget, there are multiple referrals  to the DOJ and the FBI as Steele was a target of criminal investigation.   It could come to that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So all we've heard is Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, nothing yet  of any substance at all.  How long does this go on, and is it to the point  where they're going to have to find something to justify everything that's  come up to this point?</p><p>BRUNO:  Nobody knows how long.  I mean --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you said --</p><p>BRUNO:  -- how -- now, it could go on into finances.  It could go on into  past history.  We've seen that in the Gates-Manafort indictment, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  That had nothing to do with Russian collusion, it was money  laundering, it was tax related information.  So how far can he go on?  He  could go on for a while?  Hopefully for the country's sake, for our market  sake, for all of our sake --</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is bond.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- it will end quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, we're already out of time but, David Bruno, thank you  so much.</p><p>BRUNO:  Good to see you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It can make your eyes glaze over.  That's for sure.  But we're  staying up with it.  David, thank you very much.</p><p>OK, this may be a possible sign of things to come.  Five ships carrying  more than $200 million worth of U.S. sorghum changed course in the ocean  after China announced massive tariffs.</p><p>Jeff Flock, following the story from this side of the pacific where it will  have an impact, right, Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  You said it, yes, yes, sir.  You know,  it's planting time.  It's spring planting season out here, and this field  was -- when I'm walking through here and now maybe you can tell because  there's corn litter.  This was corn.  But if you're thinking about planting  sorghum, sorghum that feed grain, farmers maybe having second thoughts  about that.</p><p>I want to show you a picture of one of the ships you're talking about,  Ashley.  And that was a ship called the N Bonanza.  It was one of 20 ships  loaded with sorghum being sent to China.  We export about 80 percent of our  sorghum grown in this country to China about a billion dollars worth last  year, $2 billion worth just a couple years ago.</p><p>And those ships as you point out, many of them turned around because the  tariff was 179 percent that to retaliate against President Trump's tariffs.   As you can imagine, if you're charging almost double a tax on what you  already paid for the sorghum, pretty much, that's not really a winning  deal.</p><p>So, what can I tell you?  Sorghum farmers in the Midwest places like  Kansas, which is the number one sorghum state, pretty upset about that.  I  want to give you a quote from, I think, it's from -- well, I was going to  give you a quote from Pat Toomey who said, this is collateral damage.  But  actually, this is one from the Chinese.  </p><p>You know they say, the reason they put these tariffs on is because the U.S.  was dumping cheap sorghum into their market.  The reality is, we actually  were selling to China because they were paying a premium for our sorghum,  not cheap sorghum.  In fact, one of the Chinese companies said, even though  this price is very high, we still want to import.  We think more and more  sorghum will come into China and we will buy and import sorghum also.  That  was all before all of this trade business started.</p><p>So, I know we say it's not a trade war.  But I'll tell you, it's a battle  certainly.  And it's one that's already claiming some casualties.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Jeff, very quickly, what happens to all that sorghum out in  the ocean?  I mean, do you bring it back or do you try and find another  buyer somewhere in the region?</p><p>FLOCK:  We have found, at least in one case that N Bonanza, the ship that I  showed you the picture of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  -- that actually is headed to Singapore.  So they are able to  redirect some of it.  But right now, the sorghum market on the gulf coast,  which is where a lot of it comes from, completely bottomed out.  I mean,  there's nobody that's buying in sorghum.  So if you're sitting on sorghum,  you're sitting on a pile of nothing right at the moment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Not good.  All right, Jeff Flock, thank you so much.  Jeff out in  the field in Illinois.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Bernie Sanders, well, he molded to the mainstream.  Now more  Democratic candidates are calling themselves socialists.  But is this  really where the Democratic Party wants to go?  We'll debate that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, guess what?  Socialism is apparently becoming mainstream in  the wake of the Bernie Sanders campaign and in response to the resistance  against Donald Trump.  Growing number of candidates are, well, running as  socialists.</p><p>The National Party, the Democratic Socialists of America has growing from  about 5000 members back in 2016 to 35,000 nationwide.  All right,  interesting development.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel now.  Democratic Strategist John Summers  and Republican Strategist Boyd Matheson.</p><p>John, let me begin with you.  You know, I lived through the socialist era  of Britain in the 1970s.  It was a disaster.  And I'm very glad I will  never have to go through that again, at least, I thought so.  Now we're  hearing this \"s\" word come up again.</p><p>Why is socialism seen as answer especially among millennials?</p><p>JON SUMMERS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think what we're saying is  people who are tired of the same old, same law, I think they're seeing they  haven't been represented by Washington very well at all.  I mean, we see  this on both sides of the political spectrum.  People are dissatisfied.   This is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was elected.</p><p>I think the midterms will show that there are still a lot of possibilities.   He told them what they wanted to hear.</p><p>But now, we actually have candidates who feeling bold to stand up for the  things they believe in like, healthcare for all, raising the minimum wage,  things that strengthen the middle class, because a stronger middle class is  a stronger America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Boyd, I've always seen socialism as wanting something for  nothing.  You know, I look at East Germany, West Germany.  I look at Cuba,  South Miami.  I look at North Korea, South Korea.</p><p>I know where the people are trying to get out.  And I know where they're  trying to go, and it's generally from socialist countries to capitalist  countries.  And I think that says it all.  What say you?</p><p>BOYD MATHESON, OPINION EDITOR, DESERET NEWS:  Yes.  Well, obviously the  biggest problem with socialism that eventually you do run out of other  people's money and then everything breaks down and you have to flee.  But I  do think the point is right in terms of neither party have given people a  reason to be part of the party, especially millennials.  They're not  getting it.</p><p>And I think many of the polls show that millennials actually associate with  the term socialism but most of them don't know what it really means.  And  when they start having jobs, and start seeing how much of their paycheck  automatically vanishes to the federal government, then they start having a  problem.</p><p>And so I think what you're going to see is, many of these Democrats who are  using the socialist label, they're going to get labeled as beyond Bernie's.   People don't know what socialism is, but they know what is beyond Bernie  Sanders.  So they'll be the beyond Bernie folks.  And it's fine.</p><p>Socialism is fine for a Democratic primary in the spring but it does not  fly in a real election in the fall.  And I think that's going to be the  challenge Democrats will face, much like the Republicans have on the right  with some of those more extreme candidates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What do you say, John?  I mean, there are those that say the  Democrat Party is out of touch with the working people.  And that's what  Donald Trump tapped into.  And if they go too far left, do you alienate  more than you attract?</p><p>SUMMERS:  Well, I think Boyd and I agree on a lot of the same things,  believe it or not.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What?</p><p>SUMMERS:  I think it would be difficult to run as a socialist, you know,  but I think he is right, I think that a lot of peoples especially  millennials aren't familiar with exactly what that term means.  I think  what they're actually looking for is something different.  They're looking  for economic equity.  They're looking for people who are willing to stand  up for what they believe in.  Not only just talk the talk, but actually  walk the walk, and look out for things like increasing the minimum wage and  income equality and that sort of thing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But, Boyd, from a Republican point of view, you've got to like  this?  Don't you think that the further left, the Democrats want to go, the  better it may be for more mainstream America in the Republican Party,  perhaps?</p><p>MATHESON:  You know, I think the country is going to continue to remain  center left, center right.  It's going to be in that wheelhouse.  I do  think one of the things that the Democrats have tapped into is this  misconception of capitalism and crony capitalism.  And if the Republicans  don't take on the crony part of that, they'll continue to struggle and have  that problem as well.</p><p>I think President Trump went in talking about, you know, getting rid of the  swamp and the cronyism component of that, which does give unfair advantage  to the wealthy and well-connected.  There is a reason why six out of the 10  wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington D.C.</p><p>So it is a narrative that does swing both ways.  I don't think Republicans  should be comfortable on anything at this point and neither should the  Democrats because we could see a real shift.</p><p>WESBTER:  Right.</p><p>MATHESON:  You could see the millennials come out in force for smaller  parties, some of these broken smaller fragmented parties and that would  really change the game.  Because they will be probably over 50 percent of  the votes come November.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Well --</p><p>MATHESON:  I probably agree and I think -- oh sorry.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- we're out of time, guys.  You're just to way too agreeable.   That's the problem with this.  I never thought I would see it, but I did.</p><p>John and Boyd, we're out of time.  Thanks so much.  We'll find an issue you  can go at it next time, I promise.</p><p>And we'll be right back with more Intel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, as we reported, the suspect in Sunday's Waffle House  shooting in Nashville, Tennessee has been arrested.  Police say 29-year-old  Travis Reinking was taken into custody in a wooded area not far from for  his apartment.  Police and federal agents making the arrest after a massive  manhunt.  Reinking was reportedly nearly naked when he opened fire at the  Waffle House killing four people.</p><p>A news conference by the way has been has been scheduled for the next hour.</p><p>The market as we're talking it now is down 109 point.  I also want to bring  you up to speed on the Canadian story.  In Toronto, the driver of the van  plowing into at least eight pedestrians is also in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind the crash but  police say the van apparently jump the curb and then hit pass it or hit the  people walking down the street in the middle of Toronto.  Busy news day.</p><p>Liz Claman, I'll throw it to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

He will take you to the next hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Every day is a busy day, Charles.   Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAYNE:  All right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, French President Emmanuel Macron just landing  at Joint Base Andrews as he begins a three-day state visit hosted by  President Trump.  We're also keeping an eye on your money, of course, as  U.S. Treasury yields creep towards three percent, which is sparking new  fears of a bear market on Wall Street.  We shall see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish  Regan and on now to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump and Macron will look to strengthen their, well, bromance if  you like as both men have a lot riding on this week's visit where trade and  the Iran nuclear deal are set to dominate the agenda.  I'll be discussing  this with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, of course, North Korea says it will suspend all nuclear tests ahead  of its historic summit with South Korea.  President Trump tweeting this,  \"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work  out, and maybe they won't.  Only time will tell.\"  We have more on that  coming up.</p><p>Lots to talk about.  But, first, French President Emmanuel Macron as we say  just landing on American soil, now is making his way to Washington to meet  with President Trump.  Do we have Fox -- do we have -- he's good.  We have  Fox News's Doug McKelway.  He's at the White House with more on the big  state visit.</p><p>Doug.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Ashley.   President Macron touched down at Joint Base Andrews just within the past  hour.  And his motorcade as we speak is just pulled up to Blair House about  a block away he and the First Lady of France will stay there for the next  couple of hours before they come here to the White House, board a  helicopter with the first couple of the United States for a trip across the  Potomac River where they will dine at the George Washington's Mount Vernon  tonight before the first state dinner of the Trump administration which  takes place here at the White House tomorrow.</p><p>These two get along famously as best as we can tell that they came  evidently as early as last summer when President Trump went to Paris to  enjoy Bastille Day, and came away from that meeting, having a very close  personal relationship with Mr. Macron.  He also came away from that meeting  suggesting we have a military parade here in the United States.  That is  not to say that they're not considerable differences between the two  gentlemen.</p><p>May 12th, for example, is a deadline for Mr. Trump to decide whether to  lift sanctions on Iran.  The press secretary was asked about that just in  the briefing a few moments ago, which is now underway.  Here is what she  had to say, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  But what you do have  are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have  a great friendship.  Certainly, both have a great deal of interests in  doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and  candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders  have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before  either of these individuals arrived on the scene.  And we're going to  continue that relationship.  But I think we can expect this to be a very  productive and very positive state visit for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  She added that she does not want to get ahead of any discussions  that two might have before they actually occur.  Macron, however, does  believes that it would be a bad decision to get out of the Iran nuclear  deal.  Here's what he had to say this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  Is this agreement perfect and this  JCPOA perfect thing for our relationship with Iran?  No.  But for nuclear,  what do you have as a better option?  I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  And May 1st is another important deadline, a time for Mr. Trump  to decide whether he wants to impose tariffs on the European Union for its  importation of steel and aluminum.  Again, Mr. Macron thinks that would be  a bad idea for Mr. Trump to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make a trade your allies.  I'm very -- I'm an easy guy.   I'm very simple.  I'm straight forward.</p><p>It's too complicated if you make war against everybody.  You make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran.   Come on.  It doesn't work.  You need allies.  We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  The First Lady coming out of the shadows a little bit for this  state dinner tonight.  She is apparently behind all of the minute planning  of this first state dinner coming tomorrow night.  The first state dinner  of the Trump administration.</p><p>Ashley, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be quite an affair.  Doug McKelway at the White  House.  Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  My pleasure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Joining me now to talk about that and other issues, FormerArkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you, Governor.</p><p>You know what politics can makes for strange bedfellows, and here we have  maybe Mr. Trump's lone ally in Europe right now because he's had a public  spat with Theresa May and the U.K.  And here we have Emmanuel Macron, who  by all accounts is a political outsider who also managed to outwit the  political establishment in France.  So maybe it's not so strange that these  two individuals kind of get along?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, I think a lot of it has  to do with what you just mentioned.  They're both outsiders, but they're  also very plain-spoken people.  And they're honest with each other.  The  President likes that.  He really does.</p><p>For all those who think that he wants to be surrounded by yes men, they  don't know him very well.  He doesn't like to be ridiculed in public but he  does not mind having people in the meetings with him speak their mind.   Clearly, President Macron is able, willing to do that.  They have very  frank and open discussions.</p><p>And the good thing is, look at this.  I think it's the best relationship  we've seen with France in many years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And we didn't even have to bring James Taylor in to sing for it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I love the sarcasm.  It's an effective form of wit despite what  Stuart Varney says.  OK.  So, look, you know they're going to be talking,  Governor, about, you know, militarily ironically.</p><p>France has been right with the U.S., both against ISIS and in Syria.  But  then we have the nuke deal with Iran.  We have trade.  We have climate  change.</p><p>Can they get any common ground?  Because I don't think the President is  going to say, \"He's kind of hinted yes, OK, maybe we can get back into the  Paris climate accord.\"  I don't see that happening.  And with regard to the  Iran nuke deal, we heard Macron speaking this weekend.  It doesn't feel  like they're going to get any common ground there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  They maybe not, Ashley.  But I think that there is a likelihood  that there will be some compromise on both parties to bring something to  the table that works.  But the President has been very clear.  He's  President of the United States.</p><p>He doesn't capitulate to any other country.  He does what's best for  America.  And he expects every other world leader to do the exact same  thing for their country.</p><p>But if he can be convinced whether it's by Macron or one of the others that  this is really in the best interests of the United States I think he is  open to it.  But I'll be very clear to say, if it's not in the best  interests of the United States he's not interested at all.  This President  is not in simply trying to be popular with world leaders.  He wants to be  effective in making sure that he takes care of America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely true.  OK, we're gong to completely change gears.  Now  I want to ask you about this one.  Canadian country singer Shania Twain  issuing an apology after getting a lot of backlash for saying she would  have voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.</p><p>I mean, how could she say such a thing?  What are your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's so sad that the left refuses to allow anyone to speak his  or her mind without being just pilloried and excoriated unless they agree  with the left of center viewpoint that they hold.  This is the most  intolerant bunch of people I've ever seen in my life, Ashley, and this is a  great example.</p><p>You know, it's sad that Shania Twain felt like she had to apologize, but  the backlash that she got for simply expressing an opinion, why can't she  do that?  She ought to be able to.  Tragic day.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, exactly.  We've seen it, you know, certainly coming out of  Hollywood in the movie business.  No different, I guess, in the music  business as well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Too bad and it's unfortunate.  We need to be able to have the  kind of honest discussions that we're seeing between the French and  American President where we don't always agree but we do it respectfully.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very well-said.  Governor Huckabee, thank you so much for joining  us today.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets for you.  Stocks  just slightly lower as Wall Street kicks off its biggest week for corporate  earnings.  The Dow off 57 points, and we start lows earnings today with  Google after the closing bell today, or Alphabet, the parent company.</p><p>Let's get down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where our own  Nicole Petallides has the latest.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, good afternoon, Ashley.  So,  as you noted, we're watching for Google after the bell.  We're taking a  look at the broader market right now, and you do see all down arrows with  the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 64 points after some choppy  trading, down volume, slightly ahead of up volume.  And the Dow, the NASDAQ  and the S&amp;P all lower today, but for the month, in the green.</p><p>Interestingly enough, we've seen oil pulling just slightly higher now after  having being down.  But the dollar and Treasury yields have been a big  story, taking a look at 10-year Treasury, which on Friday was settling at  highest levels since January 2014.</p><p>Look at this, getting closer to that very psychological level of three  percent.  Two point ninety-eight percent right now for the 10-year bond  yield.  Of course, as that moves higher we'll watch for that.</p><p>Taking a look at the tech earnings, I want to get to that quickly.   AlphabetGoogle is slightly lower.  Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all  of these this week, it is going to be a huge week for tech earnings.  And I  spoke with Joel Kulina over at Wedbush and he basically said, clearly,  large cap tech has taking somewhat of a hit.  But most of the investors  will be looking at these, looking at the capital return announcements on  all of them.</p><p>And, of course, regulatory overhang for the names, such as Facebook and  Google.  They gave me a lot on each one of them.  We'll break it down  throughout each of the hits, but we'll see all down arrows right now,  Google after the bell.  We'll have to see it here.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Another busy week for you, Nicole.  Thank you so much.   Appreciate it.  Nicole, make sure to watch \"After the Bell,\" at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern today for the latest earnings report from Alphabet/Google right  here on Fox Business.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, we'll have more on these markets as, yes, as Nicole  said the 10-year Treasury yield is nearing at magical three percent.  Is it  magical or is it a nightmare?  We'll find out.</p><p>Plus, new questions about the Russia investigation.  House Intelligence  Chairman Devin Nunes revealing that there was no official intelligence used  to start that probe into the Trump campaign.  We'll have the intel later in  the show.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  A lot of breaking news to bring you right now.  Let's begin with  news from the Nashville Police Department, which says the suspect in the  Waffle House shooting there has been taken into custody just moments ago.   So that's an update there.</p><p>Meanwhile, north of the border, several people in Toronto had been hurt  after a white van reportedly plowed into a group of pedestrians.  The  extent of injuries on whether it was intentional or an accident is still  not known.  We're told that at least eight people are said to have been hit  by that white van.  Of course, we'll keep monitoring all of the stories and  bring you the very latest updates as they become available.</p><p>Let's get back to politics.  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announcing he  supports CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be the next Secretary of State,  tweeting this.  \"After meeting with Mike Pompeo, discussing his foreign  policy perspectives and considering his distinguished time as CIA Director  and his exemplary career in public service, I will vote to confirm Mike  Pompeo to be our next Secretary of State.\"</p><p>Now Manchin is the second Democrat to support Pompeo's nomination, possibly  giving him some momentum ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.  That panel, though, poised to vote against Pompeo.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this, American Progress Action Fund Larry Korb.   All right.  Larry, why this unprecedented rebuke of Mike Pompeo?  Is it  just purely obstructionism?  What's the play here?</p><p>LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND:  Well, I think a  lot of the people, including Republican Rand Paul are concerned that his  positions will reinforce President Trump's worst tendencies and they want  someone who will serve, you know, as a counterweight.  And I don't think  Director Pompeo has helped himself by not telling the members of the  committee off-line, you know, about his North Korean trip because this is  theoretically acting like a Secretary of State before you get there.  But,  as you pointed out, he will be confirmed.</p><p>And, you know, people talk about it.  People forget when Chuck Hagel,  Senator Hagel went up to be Secretary of Defense under President Obama, he  only got three Republican votes on the floor.  So this is not unprecedented  for people to use this to make another point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you could argue, Larry, that the point that Mr. Pompeo didn't  tell anyone or told the least amount of people possible is that it's a  chronic place for leaking information.  And there's one thing they didn't  want was for that visit to Pyongyang to come out before he went there and  came back.  And then we could talk about it, but he didn't want that to be  known to the general public.  And Washington is a place for leaks.</p><p>KORB:  No, but I think when he came back he should have briefed them off- line because, again, the worst thing you do -- well, I remember my own  experience, if you start acting like you got the job before you are  confirmed, a lot of people will not take that very well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So you do believe he'll get through the full Senate?</p><p>KORB:  I think he will because you've already got, at least two Democrats.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>KORB:  And so, I think he will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Could it unsettle the North Korean negotiations effort?  Is their  timing on this pretty poor?</p><p>KORB:  No, I don't think so.  And I think, you know, basically, his trip  was the right thing to do, or somebody should have gone, you know, to talk  to the North Koreans who lay the groundwork.  And today, over the weekend  we've seen some public back and forth, and I think once sensible thing the  administration has said is, they're not going to make any concessions just  because he stopped doing what he's doing.  He's going to have to start  dismantling stuff before we relax the economic sanctions.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that's going to be the key elements, one, nuke, you know,  dismantlement.  But, first, the timetable for the sanctions comes after  that, which really puts the ball in the court of North Korea.  I guess the  fact that we're talking is very positive, but we have to have a pretty  hefty amount of skepticism when we look at this as well.</p><p>KORB:  Yes.  I mean the North Koreans promised several times going back to  the 1990s that they're going to do something that they didn't do it.  So  you not only wanted to start dismantling it, you want to have intrusive  inspections much like we have, for example, in Iran where they can go in  and check and see that he's living up to the deal.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Do you think President Trump's unconventional approach, the  tweets, the \"rocket man\" references, all of that have kind of  discombobulated Pyongyang a little bit and that's what's got us to this  point?</p><p>KORB:  I think the key thing was the sanctions.  I give President Trump for  giving much tougher sanctions than we have before because we got the  international community, particularly the Chinese and Russians to go along.   Now, they may have been concerned that, you know, President Trump might do  something erratic.</p><p>But the fact in the matter those sanctions are starting to hurt, and that's  why he has stopped this program because he has gotten as far as he wants  to.  He has the capability.  The question is now, are you going to you  limit that capability.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Ten seconds, Larry.  Are you confident we can get something out  of this summit?</p><p>KORB:  I think we can because, again, I think the sanctions are beginning  to bite and I think that he recognizes that this is once in a lifetime  opportunity, not only with us, but a very liberal government in South  Korea.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good point.  Well, we shall see, as they say.  Larry Korb,  thank you so much.  Larry, appreciate it.</p><p>KORB:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets.  We're being down  slightly lower on the Dow.  We're off 85 points, now maybe getting a little  momentum on the downside.  We'll have more on the markets and what's moving  them on the intel right after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  We want to get back now to that story out of Toronto as we're  getting more information.  The driver of a white van, a white Ryder van  plowing into at least eight to 10 pedestrians on the sidewalk.  That driver  now in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind this.  Police say  the van apparently jumped the curb.  This is all happening as Cabinet  ministers from the G7 countries are gathered in Toronto right now ahead of  June summit in Quebec.</p><p>Eyewitnesses saying it appeared the driver did indeed deliberately tried to  hit people on the sidewalk.  But, again, we don't know what's the motive  for this yet, but the suspect is in custody.</p><p>Let's get back to the markets.  Stocks are at sessions lows as the 10-year  Treasury yield hovers right around its highest level in four years, now  closing in on three percent causing economists who worry about rising,  borrowing costs.</p><p>Joining me now is MaxFund.com Founder Jonas Ferris along with Surevest  Wealth Management CEO Rob Luna.</p><p>All right.  Jonas, let me begin with you.  Why is three percent on the 10- year such a psychological level?  Surely, we can handle three percent  because historically that's still really low?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOUNDER, MAXFUND.COM:  Historically it's low.  It is less  psychologically useful than like Dow 10,000 was technically meaningless and  20,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just a price index on stocks.  That's an arbitrary.  The  whole -- you know, you're borrowing money at these rates and you're  investing money at these rates.  So, like it means something to  institutional investors and retail investors.</p><p>You know, people might not take a mortgage if it breaks a certain threshold  in their head or a car loan.  That's why you see like 3.99 percent fines in  yields.  This is a meaningful threshold.  And a lot of buyers are coming in  at three.  And that's what happened for all of the last times you run up to  three over the last three years.</p><p>And a lot of demands for bonds when the rate gets a little higher.  It's  still low historically but it's a safe yield.  And, you know, the stock  market is high and it's very volatile as you've seen in recent months.</p><p>So there's been a lot of independent demand that comes in around three.   And maybe the government is selling hundreds of billions of dollars of debt  at this level, so we're very concerned, is it going to breach three and all  of a sudden it was going to panic and say, \"OK, the 30-year bull market in  Treasury is over and bonds is over?\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Then we go to 3.4, four, and that's when the real panic would  start.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Rob, I moved to the United States in 1982.  It was a  real steal if you got a mortgage for 16 percent.  So I have a hard time  panicking over this, but I get Jonas' point.  It's seems, Rob, that we're  trading in a range right now, especially with a perceived hawkish Fed in  background just waiting to raise rates.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Yes, and that's exactly it,  Ashley.  I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of the year.  And I  really expect that to continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>You know, I've been seeing for a while the easy money is done in this  market.  And investors really need to change their playbook if they're  going to be able to generate returns.  And quite honestly, importantly,  mitigate the risk in their portfolio.</p><p>You know, the idea of 60/40 buy and hold portfolio where bonds are expected  to be that buffer to cushion at the downside of stocks as we've already  seen this year is not working.  And some of the more conservative investors  are the one actually taking the brunt of the storm.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we're going to find out the latest earnings from the big  tech companies this week.  We kick it off after the bell today with Google.   If we have a blowout performance by these big, big technology companies how  much impetus does that give to the market?</p><p>FERRIS:  It's helpful.  We saw that with Netflix recently.  But I think  that -- there's still a lot of fear that the underlying business model of a  Google and Facebook, which is largely based on privacy -- looking to  privacy and selling it off to advertisers, is under the spotlight.  And the  more we learn about those behaviors, the more we're concerned that there's  going to be a regulatory crackdown or there's a consumer revolt.  And it's  going to limit the earnings growth potential of these companies.</p><p>Even with good numbers right now, I think there's a lot -- there's enough  fear baked into that side of the FANG so-called equation which is, again,  largely based on selling targeted advertising and more as we learn every  week, we think there's new revelation what they're doing with your data  when you're not getting logged in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just absurd.  So, I think that's going to keep them in it.   We have not seen Apple phone sales as strong as people would like.  So  there's a lot of pressure in tech.  And a good earnings report isn't going  to take that away at this point.</p><p>It will be helpful like it was in Netflix, but at this point there's long- term fears there and that's why the three percent Treasury yield is  starting to look comforting to people --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- in the world of maybe tech companies aren't going to grow as  fast as they have.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.  You know, Rob, we had an analyst on this morning on our  network who said the only thing that really worries him, he feels like  earnings are strong, the economy is humming along nicely, some sort of  geopolitical situation could really knock it off the axis.  Do you have  concerns like that?</p><p>LUNA:  Well, I mean, geopolitical concerns, Ashley, are always in our  outlook for the markets, and something that could happen at anytime.  So,  yes, if you see something like that, you know, I think part of the reason  we've calm down and we've had a positive month is because the rhetoric out  of North Korea is kind of calmed down quite a bit and we're starting to see  progress there.  So, if that starts to tick back up again, if earnings  don't come in that great, and you start to see this interest rates rise  above three percent, those are all going to provide headwinds for investors  in this market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we'll play the what if game.  What if the Democrats take  back the House, does that have impact on the market?  Perhaps the less  business-friendly House, would that have that have an impact?</p><p>FERRIS:  I don't think that's a current concern because it wouldn't lead to  like tax cuts.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  You're not going to automatically have higher corporate tax rate  just because there's a power change.  So there would have to be such a huge  swing for there anything that affect what the market liked, which was the  tax package in recent years.</p><p>I think, you know, there's a positive and negative going on right now.   These rates are going up because the economy is strong, partially because  of tax cuts.  So, it's not like it's all bad that rates are going up.  The  question is do they go up so fast that it's faster, or does the Fed raise  rates too high and causes recession?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  That's what kind of the fears.  But, again, there's an underlying  strength here that people want to invest in, which is why the stock market  is still strong.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  People don't want to miss what could be an even longer bull  market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, Rob, could the tax cuts kind of counteract the rising  interest rates?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, I think so.  And I think that's what where going to start  seeing, Ashley, out of companies as they're starting to report this  quarter.  And that's why expectations are so high for earnings.</p><p>But let's be careful, you know, I think Jeremy Siegel out of Lawrence  talked about this quite a bit, that a lot of this is going to be front-end  loaded.  You're getting this accelerated depreciation in assets.  But come  next year when all that sworn off, if companies can't generate good top- lines growth, I think you're going to see all of this taken back.</p><p>And I think investors are pretty smart that they're starting to look at  that now.  So even though companies are being in these expectations,  they're still a little bit skeptical if they're going to be able to  continue that especially in a rising interest rate environment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Jonas, it feels like we've lost the volatility that we  had just weeks ago where we were up 400, down another 500.  As I said to  Rob earlier on, we're now in this kind of a range which I think comforts  the average investor because that volatility can be very, you know, very  alarming.</p><p>FERRIS:  It was.  We had a few like eras of that since, but it's been, you  know, a pretty much non-stop, you know, bull market since early 2009.  So,  there's been, you know, there's the Greece problems of the debt bangs.   There's always been a volatility era.</p><p>Then it seems just go away when we go on to higher things.  But at this  point, it does seem like we're moving more sideways then we were going to  have to see that the economy can grow in spite so to say of higher rates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Because a lot of people also believe the opposite that rates are  going up because of the tax cuts possibly in a way to counter the benefit  of them.  And that's where we kind of watching for and, again, it's always  been the case where they raise rates too high.  Thinking the economy is too  hot, cause a recession.  You don't want to be sitting in a high P-E stock  portfolio when we go to next recession.  So that's kind of the fear.</p><p>And to your original point, you know, these home prices, when you are --  they need to be have mortgages --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- the home prices weren't based on having a three percent  mortgage.  So that's what's they've been concerned what happens when they  go back to six percent, because the home prices have to go right back down  to adjust to that or they're going to stay there --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good point.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- showing to the market right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, I hope we don't drop suddenly 500 points as I've just  said.  Anyway, Jonas and Rob, thank you so much gentlemen for --</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- talking about the markets with us.  Really appreciate it.</p><p>Let's get back now more on this breaking news out of Toronto as police say  a van hit at least eight people on the sidewalk, but any motive unknown at  this hour but we do know that the driver is in custody.</p><p>Fox News's Catherine Herridge, a native of Toronto, by the way, joins me  right now with more on this story.</p><p>Catherine, what are you hearing?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're  waiting for some indication from the police as to the motivation of the  suspect and the identification of the suspect.  But having covered Homeland  Security now for 18 years, I can tell you a number of things really stand  out to me about the incident.</p><p>Number one, for those at home who are not familiar with Toronto, Young  Street is the main north-south artery running through the city.  It starts  at Lake Ontario.  And then it travels up dozens of miles to Northern  Ontario.  I think it may in fact be the longest street running north-south  in the entire country of Canada.</p><p>And this intersection with Finch Avenue is one of the major east-west  arteries.  And it's also one of the major hubs for the subway system there  known as the TTC, the Toronto Transit Commission.</p><p>So you have one of the major arteries in the city.  You also have coupled  with that, the subway system and then you also have the time of day, 1:30.   This is when people are finishing up their lunch hour and heading back to  work.  And this area is not only a business area but it's a heavily  residential area.  There are a lot of large condominium complexes up in  that part of Toronto with sort of what I would call smaller residential  neighborhoods, older neighborhoods off to the side.</p><p>So if the individual's motivation was to inflict a maximum number of  casualties, they really kind of checked all the boxes in this particular  situation, you know, a major artery for traffic, vehicular and pedestrian  traffic in Toronto.  Also the subway system, the time of day, and based on  the eyewitness reports that we're getting out of Toronto, the driver of the  white van was driving north on Young Street and went up on to the curb and  hit the pedestrians.</p><p>So they would have hit the pedestrians if you will, coming from behind in  many cases and they would have been driving, sort of, up on that major part  of the artery on Young Street.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Catherine, you know, we've seen this played out in London, in  Barcelona, in Berlin to your point, a main thoroughfare being targeted.   But seeing from the helicopter shots, it appears to be a white Ryder van or  rental van, which really plays into the M.O. of these terrorists.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Well, I mean, there are a lot of circumstantial pieces here to  the puzzle that point towards that, but I want to just be a cautious and  responsible because we don't know --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  -- who the suspect is or what their motivation is.  But  certainly, the person who drove that van, and it appears to be a rental  van, did so in a part of the city at a time of day near a subway  intersection where they would have a maximum sort of impact if you will in  terms of casualties.  And I think that that was certainly have the  attention of police and investigators in Toronto.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely.  Catherine Herridge, thank you very much for your  insight into this.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We appreciate it.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And, of course, we will continue to follow with more details as  they become available in that incident in Toronto.</p><p>Devin Nunes says there was no official Intel to justify the Russian  investigation.  So how does a dossier funded by the opposition spur an FBI  probe?  We'll examine that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  So we've  long wanted to know what intelligence that you have that actually led to  this investigation?  So what we found now, after the investigators have  reviewed it is that, in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>We now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start  this investigation.  We know that Sidney Blumenthal and others were pushing  information into the State Department.  So we're trying to piece all of  that together.  And that's why we continue to look at the State Department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, what a tangled web we weave.  The man leading the House  Russian probe Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, right there  telling our Maria Bartiromo this weekend there was no intelligence used to  begin a probe into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  If  you're confused before, just to add to it now.</p><p>Joining me now, former Prosecutor David Bruno.  All right.  David, so to  Mr. Nunes' point, they applied for a FISA warrant based solely not as he  says on intel, no official intelligence.  But based on the dossier, the  information provided within that was funded by the Democratic National  Committee.  Correct?</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FMR. PROSECUTOR AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Well, correct.   And these are two different issues.  What Devin Nunes just talked about --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- is how the investigation was started.  We know that it was  started in July of 2016.  And it was started as a result of a conversation  that George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat.</p><p>WEBSTER:  In the bar?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right, right.  So, in the Schiff Minority memorandum on FISA, they  point to that.  They say it wasn't Steele that initiated investigation.  It  was the Papadopoulos information.  What we found out is that the  information about the Papadopoulos statements didn't come through normal  channels.  We would expect that it would come through these five eyes  agreement, which is a partnership with Australia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there are no reports, there's nothing to document that  information coming our way.  So the next question is, if it didn't come  through the proper channels --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Where did it come from?</p><p>BRUNO:  -- where did it come from?  That's what they're looking at.  That's  what important when it comes --</p><p>WEBSTER:  That you have a copy here, but it's redacted.  So we don't know  yet.</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  I have it and everyone is welcome to look at the Schiff FISA  memorandum.  It is a part of it where it says that wait a second, this is  not open based on Steele.  It's opened by the Papadopoulos information that  came from the Australians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen, let's talk about Steele because a lot was being  made of this.  He was actually terminated by the FBI even though the  information that he accumulated for them was used?</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  He was terminated for leaking stuff to the press, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there's arguments to be made that the information that he  provided to the press was also used in the FISA applications, which is  called circular reporting.  So the argument was made that, well, there's  press information that corroborates Steele, but Steele was the actual  source.  A lot to be made, let's not forget, there are multiple referrals  to the DOJ and the FBI as Steele was a target of criminal investigation.   It could come to that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So all we've heard is Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, nothing yet  of any substance at all.  How long does this go on, and is it to the point  where they're going to have to find something to justify everything that's  come up to this point?</p><p>BRUNO:  Nobody knows how long.  I mean --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you said --</p><p>BRUNO:  -- how -- now, it could go on into finances.  It could go on into  past history.  We've seen that in the Gates-Manafort indictment, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  That had nothing to do with Russian collusion, it was money  laundering, it was tax related information.  So how far can he go on?  He  could go on for a while?  Hopefully for the country's sake, for our market  sake, for all of our sake --</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is bond.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- it will end quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, we're already out of time but, David Bruno, thank you  so much.</p><p>BRUNO:  Good to see you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It can make your eyes glaze over.  That's for sure.  But we're  staying up with it.  David, thank you very much.</p><p>OK, this may be a possible sign of things to come.  Five ships carrying  more than $200 million worth of U.S. sorghum changed course in the ocean  after China announced massive tariffs.</p><p>Jeff Flock, following the story from this side of the pacific where it will  have an impact, right, Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  You said it, yes, yes, sir.  You know,  it's planting time.  It's spring planting season out here, and this field  was -- when I'm walking through here and now maybe you can tell because  there's corn litter.  This was corn.  But if you're thinking about planting  sorghum, sorghum that feed grain, farmers maybe having second thoughts  about that.</p><p>I want to show you a picture of one of the ships you're talking about,  Ashley.  And that was a ship called the N Bonanza.  It was one of 20 ships  loaded with sorghum being sent to China.  We export about 80 percent of our  sorghum grown in this country to China about a billion dollars worth last  year, $2 billion worth just a couple years ago.</p><p>And those ships as you point out, many of them turned around because the  tariff was 179 percent that to retaliate against President Trump's tariffs.   As you can imagine, if you're charging almost double a tax on what you  already paid for the sorghum, pretty much, that's not really a winning  deal.</p><p>So, what can I tell you?  Sorghum farmers in the Midwest places like  Kansas, which is the number one sorghum state, pretty upset about that.  I  want to give you a quote from, I think, it's from -- well, I was going to  give you a quote from Pat Toomey who said, this is collateral damage.  But  actually, this is one from the Chinese.  </p><p>You know they say, the reason they put these tariffs on is because the U.S.  was dumping cheap sorghum into their market.  The reality is, we actually  were selling to China because they were paying a premium for our sorghum,  not cheap sorghum.  In fact, one of the Chinese companies said, even though  this price is very high, we still want to import.  We think more and more  sorghum will come into China and we will buy and import sorghum also.  That  was all before all of this trade business started.</p><p>So, I know we say it's not a trade war.  But I'll tell you, it's a battle  certainly.  And it's one that's already claiming some casualties.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Jeff, very quickly, what happens to all that sorghum out in  the ocean?  I mean, do you bring it back or do you try and find another  buyer somewhere in the region?</p><p>FLOCK:  We have found, at least in one case that N Bonanza, the ship that I  showed you the picture of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  -- that actually is headed to Singapore.  So they are able to  redirect some of it.  But right now, the sorghum market on the gulf coast,  which is where a lot of it comes from, completely bottomed out.  I mean,  there's nobody that's buying in sorghum.  So if you're sitting on sorghum,  you're sitting on a pile of nothing right at the moment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Not good.  All right, Jeff Flock, thank you so much.  Jeff out in  the field in Illinois.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Bernie Sanders, well, he molded to the mainstream.  Now more  Democratic candidates are calling themselves socialists.  But is this  really where the Democratic Party wants to go?  We'll debate that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, guess what?  Socialism is apparently becoming mainstream in  the wake of the Bernie Sanders campaign and in response to the resistance  against Donald Trump.  Growing number of candidates are, well, running as  socialists.</p><p>The National Party, the Democratic Socialists of America has growing from  about 5000 members back in 2016 to 35,000 nationwide.  All right,  interesting development.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel now.  Democratic Strategist John Summers  and Republican Strategist Boyd Matheson.</p><p>John, let me begin with you.  You know, I lived through the socialist era  of Britain in the 1970s.  It was a disaster.  And I'm very glad I will  never have to go through that again, at least, I thought so.  Now we're  hearing this \"s\" word come up again.</p><p>Why is socialism seen as answer especially among millennials?</p><p>JON SUMMERS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think what we're saying is  people who are tired of the same old, same law, I think they're seeing they  haven't been represented by Washington very well at all.  I mean, we see  this on both sides of the political spectrum.  People are dissatisfied.   This is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was elected.</p><p>I think the midterms will show that there are still a lot of possibilities.   He told them what they wanted to hear.</p><p>But now, we actually have candidates who feeling bold to stand up for the  things they believe in like, healthcare for all, raising the minimum wage,  things that strengthen the middle class, because a stronger middle class is  a stronger America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Boyd, I've always seen socialism as wanting something for  nothing.  You know, I look at East Germany, West Germany.  I look at Cuba,  South Miami.  I look at North Korea, South Korea.</p><p>I know where the people are trying to get out.  And I know where they're  trying to go, and it's generally from socialist countries to capitalist  countries.  And I think that says it all.  What say you?</p><p>BOYD MATHESON, OPINION EDITOR, DESERET NEWS:  Yes.  Well, obviously the  biggest problem with socialism that eventually you do run out of other  people's money and then everything breaks down and you have to flee.  But I  do think the point is right in terms of neither party have given people a  reason to be part of the party, especially millennials.  They're not  getting it.</p><p>And I think many of the polls show that millennials actually associate with  the term socialism but most of them don't know what it really means.  And  when they start having jobs, and start seeing how much of their paycheck  automatically vanishes to the federal government, then they start having a  problem.</p><p>And so I think what you're going to see is, many of these Democrats who are  using the socialist label, they're going to get labeled as beyond Bernie's.   People don't know what socialism is, but they know what is beyond Bernie  Sanders.  So they'll be the beyond Bernie folks.  And it's fine.</p><p>Socialism is fine for a Democratic primary in the spring but it does not  fly in a real election in the fall.  And I think that's going to be the  challenge Democrats will face, much like the Republicans have on the right  with some of those more extreme candidates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What do you say, John?  I mean, there are those that say the  Democrat Party is out of touch with the working people.  And that's what  Donald Trump tapped into.  And if they go too far left, do you alienate  more than you attract?</p><p>SUMMERS:  Well, I think Boyd and I agree on a lot of the same things,  believe it or not.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What?</p><p>SUMMERS:  I think it would be difficult to run as a socialist, you know,  but I think he is right, I think that a lot of peoples especially  millennials aren't familiar with exactly what that term means.  I think  what they're actually looking for is something different.  They're looking  for economic equity.  They're looking for people who are willing to stand  up for what they believe in.  Not only just talk the talk, but actually  walk the walk, and look out for things like increasing the minimum wage and  income equality and that sort of thing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But, Boyd, from a Republican point of view, you've got to like  this?  Don't you think that the further left, the Democrats want to go, the  better it may be for more mainstream America in the Republican Party,  perhaps?</p><p>MATHESON:  You know, I think the country is going to continue to remain  center left, center right.  It's going to be in that wheelhouse.  I do  think one of the things that the Democrats have tapped into is this  misconception of capitalism and crony capitalism.  And if the Republicans  don't take on the crony part of that, they'll continue to struggle and have  that problem as well.</p><p>I think President Trump went in talking about, you know, getting rid of the  swamp and the cronyism component of that, which does give unfair advantage  to the wealthy and well-connected.  There is a reason why six out of the 10  wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington D.C.</p><p>So it is a narrative that does swing both ways.  I don't think Republicans  should be comfortable on anything at this point and neither should the  Democrats because we could see a real shift.</p><p>WESBTER:  Right.</p><p>MATHESON:  You could see the millennials come out in force for smaller  parties, some of these broken smaller fragmented parties and that would  really change the game.  Because they will be probably over 50 percent of  the votes come November.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Well --</p><p>MATHESON:  I probably agree and I think -- oh sorry.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- we're out of time, guys.  You're just to way too agreeable.   That's the problem with this.  I never thought I would see it, but I did.</p><p>John and Boyd, we're out of time.  Thanks so much.  We'll find an issue you  can go at it next time, I promise.</p><p>And we'll be right back with more Intel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, as we reported, the suspect in Sunday's Waffle House  shooting in Nashville, Tennessee has been arrested.  Police say 29-year-old  Travis Reinking was taken into custody in a wooded area not far from for  his apartment.  Police and federal agents making the arrest after a massive  manhunt.  Reinking was reportedly nearly naked when he opened fire at the  Waffle House killing four people.</p><p>A news conference by the way has been has been scheduled for the next hour.</p><p>The market as we're talking it now is down 109 point.  I also want to bring  you up to speed on the Canadian story.  In Toronto, the driver of the van  plowing into at least eight pedestrians is also in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind the crash but  police say the van apparently jump the curb and then hit pass it or hit the  people walking down the street in the middle of Toronto.  Busy news day.</p><p>Liz Claman, I'll throw it to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAYNE: All right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER: Breaking right now, French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>just landing at Joint Base Andrews as he begins a three-day state visit hosted by <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>We're also keeping an eye on your money, of course, as U.S. Treasury yields creep towards three percent, which is sparking new fears of a bear market on Wall Street. We shall see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome. I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish Regan and on now to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and Macron will look to strengthen their, well, bromance if you like as both men have a lot riding on this week's visit where trade and the Iran nuclear deal are set to dominate the agenda. I'll be discussing this with former Arkansas<person><nameText>Governor Mike Huckabee </nameText></person>straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, of course, North Korea says it will suspend all nuclear tests ahead of its historic summit with South Korea. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>tweeting this, \"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won't. Only time will tell.\" We have more on that coming up.</p><p>Lots to talk about. But, first, French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>as we say just landing on American soil, now is making his way to Washington to meet with <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Do we have Fox -- do we have -- he's good. We have Fox News's Doug McKelway. He's at the White House with more on the big state visit.</p><p>Doug.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWSWASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Ashley. President Macron touched down at Joint Base Andrews just within the past hour. And his motorcade as we speak is just pulled up to Blair House about a block away he and the First Lady of France will stay there for the next couple of hours before they come here to the White House, board a helicopter with the first couple of the United States for a trip across the Potomac River where they will dine at the George Washington's Mount Vernon tonight before the first state dinner of the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>which takes place here at the White House tomorrow.</p><p>These two get along famously as best as we can tell that they came evidently as early as last summer when <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>went to Paris to enjoy Bastille Day, and came away from that meeting, having a very close personal relationship with Mr. Macron. He also came away from that meeting suggesting we have a military parade here in the United States. That is not to say that they're not considerable differences between the two gentlemen.</p><p>May 12th, for example, is a deadline for Mr. Trump to decide whether to lift sanctions on Iran. The press secretary was asked about that just in the briefing a few moments ago, which is now underway. Here is what she had to say, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: But what you do have are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have a great friendship. Certainly, both have a great deal of interests in doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before either of these individuals arrived on the scene. And we're going to continue that relationship. But I think we can expect this to be a very productive and very positive state visit for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: She added that she does not want to get ahead of any discussions that two might have before they actually occur. Macron, however, does believes that it would be a bad decision to get out of the Iran nuclear deal. Here's what he had to say this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>EMMANUEL MACRON, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF FRANCE: Is this agreement perfect and this JCPOA perfect thing for our relationship with Iran? No. But for nuclear, what do you have as a better option? I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: And May 1st is another important deadline, a time for Mr. Trump to decide whether he wants to impose tariffs on the European Union for its importation of steel and aluminum. Again, Mr. Macron thinks that would be a bad idea for Mr. Trump to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON: You cannot make a trade your allies. I'm very -- I'm an easy guy. I'm very simple. I'm straight forward.</p><p>It's too complicated if you make war against everybody. You make trade war against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran. Come on. It doesn't work. You need allies. We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: The First Lady coming out of the shadows a little bit for this state dinner tonight. She is apparently behind all of the minute planning of this first state dinner coming tomorrow night. The first state dinner of the <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>Ashley, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: It's going to be quite an affair. Doug McKelway at the White House. Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>MCKELWAY: My pleasure.</p><p>WEBSTER: Joining me now to talk about that and other issues, FormerArkansas<person><nameText>Governor Mike Huckabee. </nameText></person>Great to see you, Governor.</p><p>You know what politics can makes for strange bedfellows, and here we have maybe Mr. Trump's lone ally in Europe right now because he's had a public spat with Theresa May and the U.K. And here we have <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron, </nameText></person>who by all accounts is a political outsider who also managed to outwit the political establishment in France. So maybe it's not so strange that these two individuals kind of get along?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Well, I think a lot of it has to do with what you just mentioned. They're both outsiders, but they're also very plain-spoken people. And they're honest with each other. The President likes that. He really does.</p><p>For all those who think that he wants to be surrounded by yes men, they don't know him very well. He doesn't like to be ridiculed in public but he does not mind having people in the meetings with him speak their mind. Clearly, President Macron is able, willing to do that. They have very frank and open discussions.</p><p>And the good thing is, look at this. I think it's the best relationship we've seen with France in many years.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE: And we didn't even have to bring James Taylor in to sing for it.</p><p>WEBSTER: I love the sarcasm. It's an effective form of wit despite what Stuart Varney says. OK. So, look, you know they're going to be talking, Governor, about, you know, militarily ironically.</p><p>France has been right with the U.S., both against ISIS and in Syria. But then we have the nuke deal with Iran. We have trade. We have climate change.</p><p>Can they get any common ground? Because I don't think the President is going to say, \"He's kind of hinted yes, OK, maybe we can get back into the Paris climate accord.\" I don't see that happening. And with regard to the Iran nuke deal, we heard Macron speaking this weekend. It doesn't feel like they're going to get any common ground there.</p><p>HUCKABEE: They maybe not, Ashley. But I think that there is a likelihood that there will be some compromise on both parties to bring something to the table that works. But the President has been very clear. He's President of the United States.</p><p>He doesn't capitulate to any other country. He does what's best for America. And he expects every other world leader to do the exact same thing for their country.</p><p>But if he can be convinced whether it's by Macron or one of the others that this is really in the best interests of the United States I think he is open to it. But I'll be very clear to say, if it's not in the best interests of the United States he's not interested at all. This President is not in simply trying to be popular with world leaders. He wants to be effective in making sure that he takes care of America.</p><p>WEBSTER: Absolutely true. OK, we're gong to completely change gears. Now I want to ask you about this one. Canadian country singer Shania Twain issuing an apology after getting a lot of backlash for saying she would have voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.</p><p>I mean, how could she say such a thing? What are your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE: It's so sad that the left refuses to allow anyone to speak his or her mind without being just pilloried and excoriated unless they agree with the left of center viewpoint that they hold. This is the most intolerant bunch of people I've ever seen in my life, Ashley, and this is a great example.</p><p>You know, it's sad that Shania Twain felt like she had to apologize, but the backlash that she got for simply expressing an opinion, why can't she do that? She ought to be able to. Tragic day.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes, exactly. We've seen it, you know, certainly coming out of Hollywood in the movie business. No different, I guess, in the music business as well.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Too bad and it's unfortunate. We need to be able to have the kind of honest discussions that we're seeing between the French and American President where we don't always agree but we do it respectfully.</p><p>WEBSTER: Very well-said. Governor Huckabee, thank you so much for joining us today. I really appreciate it.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Let's take a look at these markets for you. Stocks just slightly lower as Wall Street kicks off its biggest week for corporate earnings. The Dow off 57 points, and we start lows earnings today with Google after the closing bell today, or Alphabet, the parent company.</p><p>Let's get down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where our own Nicole Petallides has the latest. Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Hey, good afternoon, Ashley. So, as you noted, we're watching for Google after the bell. We're taking a look at the broader market right now, and you do see all down arrows with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 64 points after some choppy trading, down volume, slightly ahead of up volume. And the Dow, the NASDAQ and the S&amp;P all lower today, but for the month, in the green.</p><p>Interestingly enough, we've seen oil pulling just slightly higher now after having being down. But the dollar and Treasury yields have been a big story, taking a look at 10-year Treasury, which on Friday was settling at highest levels since January 2014.</p><p>Look at this, getting closer to that very psychological level of three percent. Two point ninety-eight percent right now for the 10-year bond yield. Of course, as that moves higher we'll watch for that.</p><p>Taking a look at the tech earnings, I want to get to that quickly. AlphabetGoogle is slightly lower. Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all of these this week, it is going to be a huge week for tech earnings. And I spoke with Joel Kulina over at Wedbush and he basically said, clearly, large cap tech has taking somewhat of a hit. But most of the investors will be looking at these, looking at the capital return announcements on all of them.</p><p>And, of course, regulatory overhang for the names, such as Facebook and Google. They gave me a lot on each one of them. We'll break it down throughout each of the hits, but we'll see all down arrows right now, Google after the bell. We'll have to see it here.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Another busy week for you, Nicole. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Nicole, make sure to watch \"After the Bell,\" at 4:00 p.m. Eastern today for the latest earnings report from Alphabet/Google right here on Fox Business.</p><p>All right. Coming up, we'll have more on these markets as, yes, as Nicole said the 10-year Treasury yield is nearing at magical three percent. Is it magical or is it a nightmare? We'll find out.</p><p>Plus, new questions about the Russia investigation. House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes revealing that there was no official intelligence used to start that probe into the Trump campaign. We'll have the intel later in the show.</p><p>WEBSTER: A lot of breaking news to bring you right now. Let's begin with news from the Nashville Police Department, which says the suspect in the Waffle House shooting there has been taken into custody just moments ago. So that's an update there.</p><p>Meanwhile, north of the border, several people in Toronto had been hurt after a white van reportedly plowed into a group of pedestrians. The extent of injuries on whether it was intentional or an accident is still not known. We're told that at least eight people are said to have been hit by that white van. Of course, we'll keep monitoring all of the stories and bring you the very latest updates as they become available.</p><p>Let's get back to politics. Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announcing he supports CIA Director <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo </nameText></person>to be the next Secretary of State, tweeting this. \"After meeting with <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo, </nameText></person>discussing his foreign policy perspectives and considering his distinguished time as CIA Director and his exemplary career in public service, I will vote to confirm <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo </nameText></person>to be our next Secretary of State.\"</p><p>Now Manchin is the second Democrat to support Pompeo's nomination, possibly giving him some momentum ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. That panel, though, poised to vote against Pompeo.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this, American Progress Action Fund Larry Korb. All right. Larry, why this unprecedented rebuke of <person><nameText>Mike Pompeo? </nameText></person>Is it just purely obstructionism? What's the play here?</p><p>LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND: Well, I think a lot of the people, including Republican Rand Paul are concerned that his positions will reinforce <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>worst tendencies and they want someone who will serve, you know, as a counterweight. And I don't think Director Pompeo has helped himself by not telling the members of the committee off-line, you know, about his North Korean trip because this is theoretically acting like a Secretary of State before you get there. But, as you pointed out, he will be confirmed.</p><p>And, you know, people talk about it. People forget when Chuck Hagel, Senator Hagel went up to be Secretary of Defense under President Obama, he only got three Republican votes on the floor. So this is not unprecedented for people to use this to make another point.</p><p>WEBSTER: But you could argue, Larry, that the point that Mr. Pompeo didn't tell anyone or told the least amount of people possible is that it's a chronic place for leaking information. And there's one thing they didn't want was for that visit to Pyongyang to come out before he went there and came back. And then we could talk about it, but he didn't want that to be known to the general public. And Washington is a place for leaks.</p><p>KORB: No, but I think when he came back he should have briefed them off- line because, again, the worst thing you do -- well, I remember my own experience, if you start acting like you got the job before you are confirmed, a lot of people will not take that very well.</p><p>WEBSTER: So you do believe he'll get through the full Senate?</p><p>KORB: I think he will because you've already got, at least two Democrats.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>KORB: And so, I think he will.</p><p>WEBSTER: Could it unsettle the North Korean negotiations effort? Is their timing on this pretty poor?</p><p>KORB: No, I don't think so. And I think, you know, basically, his trip was the right thing to do, or somebody should have gone, you know, to talk to the North Koreans who lay the groundwork. And today, over the weekend we've seen some public back and forth, and I think once sensible thing the administration has said is, they're not going to make any concessions just because he stopped doing what he's doing. He's going to have to start dismantling stuff before we relax the economic sanctions.</p><p>WEBSTER: And that's going to be the key elements, one, nuke, you know, dismantlement. But, first, the timetable for the sanctions comes after that, which really puts the ball in the court of North Korea. I guess the fact that we're talking is very positive, but we have to have a pretty hefty amount of skepticism when we look at this as well.</p><p>KORB: Yes. I mean the North Koreans promised several times going back to the 1990s that they're going to do something that they didn't do it. So you not only wanted to start dismantling it, you want to have intrusive inspections much like we have, for example, in Iran where they can go in and check and see that he's living up to the deal.</p><p>WEBSTER: Do you think <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>unconventional approach, the tweets, the \"rocket man\" references, all of that have kind of discombobulated Pyongyang a little bit and that's what's got us to this point?</p><p>KORB: I think the key thing was the sanctions. I give <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>for giving much tougher sanctions than we have before because we got the international community, particularly the Chinese and Russians to go along. Now, they may have been concerned that, you know, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>might do something erratic.</p><p>But the fact in the matter those sanctions are starting to hurt, and that's why he has stopped this program because he has gotten as far as he wants to. He has the capability. The question is now, are you going to you limit that capability.</p><p>WEBSTER: Ten seconds, Larry. Are you confident we can get something out of this summit?</p><p>KORB: I think we can because, again, I think the sanctions are beginning to bite and I think that he recognizes that this is once in a lifetime opportunity, not only with us, but a very liberal government in South Korea.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Good point. Well, we shall see, as they say. Larry Korb, thank you so much. Larry, appreciate it.</p><p>KORB: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Let's take a look at these markets. We're being down slightly lower on the Dow. We're off 85 points, now maybe getting a little momentum on the downside. We'll have more on the markets and what's moving them on the intel right after the break.</p><p>WEBSTER: We want to get back now to that story out of Toronto as we're getting more information. The driver of a white van, a white Ryder van plowing into at least eight to 10 pedestrians on the sidewalk. That driver now in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind this. Police say the van apparently jumped the curb. This is all happening as Cabinet ministers from the G7 countries are gathered in Toronto right now ahead of June summit in Quebec.</p><p>Eyewitnesses saying it appeared the driver did indeed deliberately tried to hit people on the sidewalk. But, again, we don't know what's the motive for this yet, but the suspect is in custody.</p><p>Let's get back to the markets. Stocks are at sessions lows as the 10-year Treasury yield hovers right around its highest level in four years, now closing in on three percent causing economists who worry about rising, borrowing costs.</p><p>Joining me now is MaxFund.com Founder Jonas Ferris along with Surevest Wealth Management CEO Rob Luna.</p><p>All right. Jonas, let me begin with you. Why is three percent on the 10- year such a psychological level? Surely, we can handle three percent because historically that's still really low?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOUNDER, MAXFUND.COM: Historically it's low. It is less psychologically useful than like Dow 10,000 was technically meaningless and 20,000.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: It's just a price index on stocks. That's an arbitrary. The whole -- you know, you're borrowing money at these rates and you're investing money at these rates. So, like it means something to institutional investors and retail investors.</p><p>You know, people might not take a mortgage if it breaks a certain threshold in their head or a car loan. That's why you see like 3.99 percent fines in yields. This is a meaningful threshold. And a lot of buyers are coming in at three. And that's what happened for all of the last times you run up to three over the last three years.</p><p>And a lot of demands for bonds when the rate gets a little higher. It's still low historically but it's a safe yield. And, you know, the stock market is high and it's very volatile as you've seen in recent months.</p><p>So there's been a lot of independent demand that comes in around three. And maybe the government is selling hundreds of billions of dollars of debt at this level, so we're very concerned, is it going to breach three and all of a sudden it was going to panic and say, \"OK, the 30-year bull market in Treasury is over and bonds is over?\"</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: Then we go to 3.4, four, and that's when the real panic would start.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, Rob, I moved to the United States in 1982. It was a real steal if you got a mortgage for 16 percent. So I have a hard time panicking over this, but I get Jonas' point. It's seems, Rob, that we're trading in a range right now, especially with a perceived hawkish Fed in background just waiting to raise rates.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Yes, and that's exactly it, Ashley. I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of the year. And I really expect that to continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>You know, I've been seeing for a while the easy money is done in this market. And investors really need to change their playbook if they're going to be able to generate returns. And quite honestly, importantly, mitigate the risk in their portfolio.</p><p>You know, the idea of 60/40 buy and hold portfolio where bonds are expected to be that buffer to cushion at the downside of stocks as we've already seen this year is not working. And some of the more conservative investors are the one actually taking the brunt of the storm.</p><p>WEBSTER: Jonas, we're going to find out the latest earnings from the big tech companies this week. We kick it off after the bell today with Google. If we have a blowout performance by these big, big technology companies how much impetus does that give to the market?</p><p>FERRIS: It's helpful. We saw that with Netflix recently. But I think that -- there's still a lot of fear that the underlying business model of a Google and Facebook, which is largely based on privacy -- looking to privacy and selling it off to advertisers, is under the spotlight. And the more we learn about those behaviors, the more we're concerned that there's going to be a regulatory crackdown or there's a consumer revolt. And it's going to limit the earnings growth potential of these companies.</p><p>Even with good numbers right now, I think there's a lot -- there's enough fear baked into that side of the FANG so-called equation which is, again, largely based on selling targeted advertising and more as we learn every week, we think there's new revelation what they're doing with your data when you're not getting logged in.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: It's just absurd. So, I think that's going to keep them in it. We have not seen Apple phone sales as strong as people would like. So there's a lot of pressure in tech. And a good earnings report isn't going to take that away at this point.</p><p>It will be helpful like it was in Netflix, but at this point there's long- term fears there and that's why the three percent Treasury yield is starting to look comforting to people --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: -- in the world of maybe tech companies aren't going to grow as fast as they have.</p><p>WEBSTER: True. You know, Rob, we had an analyst on this morning on our network who said the only thing that really worries him, he feels like earnings are strong, the economy is humming along nicely, some sort of geopolitical situation could really knock it off the axis. Do you have concerns like that?</p><p>LUNA: Well, I mean, geopolitical concerns, Ashley, are always in our outlook for the markets, and something that could happen at anytime. So, yes, if you see something like that, you know, I think part of the reason we've calm down and we've had a positive month is because the rhetoric out of North Korea is kind of calmed down quite a bit and we're starting to see progress there. So, if that starts to tick back up again, if earnings don't come in that great, and you start to see this interest rates rise above three percent, those are all going to provide headwinds for investors in this market.</p><p>WEBSTER: Jonas, we'll play the what if game. What if the Democrats take back the House, does that have impact on the market? Perhaps the less business-friendly House, would that have that have an impact?</p><p>FERRIS: I don't think that's a current concern because it wouldn't lead to like tax cuts.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: You're not going to automatically have higher corporate tax rate just because there's a power change. So there would have to be such a huge swing for there anything that affect what the market liked, which was the tax package in recent years.</p><p>I think, you know, there's a positive and negative going on right now. These rates are going up because the economy is strong, partially because of tax cuts. So, it's not like it's all bad that rates are going up. The question is do they go up so fast that it's faster, or does the Fed raise rates too high and causes recession?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FERRIS: That's what kind of the fears. But, again, there's an underlying strength here that people want to invest in, which is why the stock market is still strong.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: People don't want to miss what could be an even longer bull market.</p><p>WEBSTER: So, Rob, could the tax cuts kind of counteract the rising interest rates?</p><p>LUNA: Yes, I think so. And I think that's what where going to start seeing, Ashley, out of companies as they're starting to report this quarter. And that's why expectations are so high for earnings.</p><p>But let's be careful, you know, I think Jeremy Siegel out of Lawrence talked about this quite a bit, that a lot of this is going to be front-end loaded. You're getting this accelerated depreciation in assets. But come next year when all that sworn off, if companies can't generate good top- lines growth, I think you're going to see all of this taken back.</p><p>And I think investors are pretty smart that they're starting to look at that now. So even though companies are being in these expectations, they're still a little bit skeptical if they're going to be able to continue that especially in a rising interest rate environment.</p><p>WEBSTER: You know, Jonas, it feels like we've lost the volatility that we had just weeks ago where we were up 400, down another 500. As I said to Rob earlier on, we're now in this kind of a range which I think comforts the average investor because that volatility can be very, you know, very alarming.</p><p>FERRIS: It was. We had a few like eras of that since, but it's been, you know, a pretty much non-stop, you know, bull market since early 2009. So, there's been, you know, there's the Greece problems of the debt bangs. There's always been a volatility era.</p><p>Then it seems just go away when we go on to higher things. But at this point, it does seem like we're moving more sideways then we were going to have to see that the economy can grow in spite so to say of higher rates.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>FERRIS: Because a lot of people also believe the opposite that rates are going up because of the tax cuts possibly in a way to counter the benefit of them. And that's where we kind of watching for and, again, it's always been the case where they raise rates too high. Thinking the economy is too hot, cause a recession. You don't want to be sitting in a high P-E stock portfolio when we go to next recession. So that's kind of the fear.</p><p>And to your original point, you know, these home prices, when you are -- they need to be have mortgages --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FERRIS: -- the home prices weren't based on having a three percent mortgage. So that's what's they've been concerned what happens when they go back to six percent, because the home prices have to go right back down to adjust to that or they're going to stay there --</p><p>WEBSTER: Very good point.</p><p>FERRIS: -- showing to the market right now.</p><p>WEBSTER: Of course, I hope we don't drop suddenly 500 points as I've just said. Anyway, Jonas and Rob, thank you so much gentlemen for --</p><p>LUNA: Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- talking about the markets with us. Really appreciate it.</p><p>Let's get back now more on this breaking news out of Toronto as police say a van hit at least eight people on the sidewalk, but any motive unknown at this hour but we do know that the driver is in custody.</p><p>Fox News's Catherine Herridge, a native of Toronto, by the way, joins me right now with more on this story.</p><p>Catherine, what are you hearing?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWSCHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, we're waiting for some indication from the police as to the motivation of the suspect and the identification of the suspect. But having covered Homeland Security now for 18 years, I can tell you a number of things really stand out to me about the incident.</p><p>Number one, for those at home who are not familiar with Toronto, Young Street is the main north-south artery running through the city. It starts at Lake Ontario. And then it travels up dozens of miles to Northern Ontario. I think it may in fact be the longest street running north-south in the entire country of Canada.</p><p>And this intersection with Finch Avenue is one of the major east-west arteries. And it's also one of the major hubs for the subway system there known as the TTC, the Toronto Transit Commission.</p><p>So you have one of the major arteries in the city. You also have coupled with that, the subway system and then you also have the time of day, 1:30. This is when people are finishing up their lunch hour and heading back to work. And this area is not only a business area but it's a heavily residential area. There are a lot of large condominium complexes up in that part of Toronto with sort of what I would call smaller residential neighborhoods, older neighborhoods off to the side.</p><p>So if the individual's motivation was to inflict a maximum number of casualties, they really kind of checked all the boxes in this particular situation, you know, a major artery for traffic, vehicular and pedestrian traffic in Toronto. Also the subway system, the time of day, and based on the eyewitness reports that we're getting out of Toronto, the driver of the white van was driving north on Young Street and went up on to the curb and hit the pedestrians.</p><p>So they would have hit the pedestrians if you will, coming from behind in many cases and they would have been driving, sort of, up on that major part of the artery on Young Street.</p><p>WEBSTER: Catherine, you know, we've seen this played out in London, in Barcelona, in Berlin to your point, a main thoroughfare being targeted. But seeing from the helicopter shots, it appears to be a white Ryder van or rental van, which really plays into the M.O. of these terrorists.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Well, I mean, there are a lot of circumstantial pieces here to the puzzle that point towards that, but I want to just be a cautious and responsible because we don't know --</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>HERRIDGE: -- who the suspect is or what their motivation is. But certainly, the person who drove that van, and it appears to be a rental van, did so in a part of the city at a time of day near a subway intersection where they would have a maximum sort of impact if you will in terms of casualties. And I think that that was certainly have the attention of police and investigators in Toronto.</p><p>WEBSTER: Absolutely. Catherine Herridge, thank you very much for your insight into this.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>WEBSTER: We appreciate it.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER: And, of course, we will continue to follow with more details as they become available in that incident in Toronto.</p><p>Devin Nunes says there was no official Intel to justify the Russian investigation. So how does a dossier funded by the opposition spur an FBI probe? We'll examine that, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: So we've long wanted to know what intelligence that you have that actually led to this investigation? So what we found now, after the investigators have reviewed it is that, in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>We now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start this investigation. We know that Sidney Blumenthal and others were pushing information into the State Department. So we're trying to piece all of that together. And that's why we continue to look at the State Department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER: Oh, what a tangled web we weave. The man leading the House Russian probe Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, right there telling our Maria Bartiromo this weekend there was no intelligence used to begin a probe into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. If you're confused before, just to add to it now.</p><p>Joining me now, former Prosecutor David Bruno. All right. David, so to Mr. Nunes' point, they applied for a FISA warrant based solely not as he says on intel, no official intelligence. But based on the dossier, the information provided within that was funded by the Democratic National Committee. Correct?</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FMR. PROSECUTOR AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, correct. And these are two different issues. What Devin Nunes just talked about --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BRUNO: -- is how the investigation was started. We know that it was started in July of 2016. And it was started as a result of a conversation that George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat.</p><p>WEBSTER: In the bar?</p><p>BRUNO: Right, right. So, in the Schiff Minority memorandum on FISA, they point to that. They say it wasn't Steele that initiated investigation. It was the Papadopoulos information. What we found out is that the information about the Papadopoulos statements didn't come through normal channels. We would expect that it would come through these five eyes agreement, which is a partnership with Australia.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BRUNO: And there are no reports, there's nothing to document that information coming our way. So the next question is, if it didn't come through the proper channels --</p><p>WEBSTER: Where did it come from?</p><p>BRUNO: -- where did it come from? That's what they're looking at. That's what important when it comes --</p><p>WEBSTER: That you have a copy here, but it's redacted. So we don't know yet.</p><p>BRUNO: Sure. I have it and everyone is welcome to look at the Schiff FISA memorandum. It is a part of it where it says that wait a second, this is not open based on Steele. It's opened by the Papadopoulos information that came from the Australians.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, listen, let's talk about Steele because a lot was being made of this. He was actually terminated by the FBI even though the information that he accumulated for them was used?</p><p>BRUNO: Sure. He was terminated for leaking stuff to the press, right?</p><p>WEBSTER: Correct.</p><p>BRUNO: And there's arguments to be made that the information that he provided to the press was also used in the FISA applications, which is called circular reporting. So the argument was made that, well, there's press information that corroborates Steele, but Steele was the actual source. A lot to be made, let's not forget, there are multiple referrals to the DOJ and the FBI as Steele was a target of criminal investigation. It could come to that.</p><p>WEBSTER: So all we've heard is Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, nothing yet of any substance at all. How long does this go on, and is it to the point where they're going to have to find something to justify everything that's come up to this point?</p><p>BRUNO: Nobody knows how long. I mean --</p><p>WEBSTER: But you said --</p><p>BRUNO: -- how -- now, it could go on into finances. It could go on into past history. We've seen that in the Gates-Manafort indictment, right?</p><p>WEBSTER: Right, yes.</p><p>BRUNO: That had nothing to do with Russian collusion, it was money laundering, it was tax related information. So how far can he go on? He could go on for a while? Hopefully for the country's sake, for our market sake, for all of our sake --</p><p>WEBSTER: This is bond.</p><p>BRUNO: -- it will end quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right, we're already out of time but, David Bruno, thank you so much.</p><p>BRUNO: Good to see you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: It can make your eyes glaze over. That's for sure. But we're staying up with it. David, thank you very much.</p><p>OK, this may be a possible sign of things to come. Five ships carrying more than $200 million worth of U.S. sorghum changed course in the ocean after China announced massive tariffs.</p><p>Jeff Flock, following the story from this side of the pacific where it will have an impact, right, Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: You said it, yes, yes, sir. You know, it's planting time. It's spring planting season out here, and this field was -- when I'm walking through here and now maybe you can tell because there's corn litter. This was corn. But if you're thinking about planting sorghum, sorghum that feed grain, farmers maybe having second thoughts about that.</p><p>I want to show you a picture of one of the ships you're talking about, Ashley. And that was a ship called the N Bonanza. It was one of 20 ships loaded with sorghum being sent to China. We export about 80 percent of our sorghum grown in this country to China about a billion dollars worth last year, $2 billion worth just a couple years ago.</p><p>And those ships as you point out, many of them turned around because the tariff was 179 percent that to retaliate against <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>tariffs. As you can imagine, if you're charging almost double a tax on what you already paid for the sorghum, pretty much, that's not really a winning deal.</p><p>So, what can I tell you? Sorghum farmers in the Midwest places like Kansas, which is the number one sorghum state, pretty upset about that. I want to give you a quote from, I think, it's from -- well, I was going to give you a quote from Pat Toomey who said, this is collateral damage. But actually, this is one from the Chinese.</p><p>You know they say, the reason they put these tariffs on is because the U.S. was dumping cheap sorghum into their market. The reality is, we actually were selling to China because they were paying a premium for our sorghum, not cheap sorghum. In fact, one of the Chinese companies said, even though this price is very high, we still want to import. We think more and more sorghum will come into China and we will buy and import sorghum also. That was all before all of this trade business started.</p><p>So, I know we say it's not a trade war. But I'll tell you, it's a battle certainly. And it's one that's already claiming some casualties.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Jeff, very quickly, what happens to all that sorghum out in the ocean? I mean, do you bring it back or do you try and find another buyer somewhere in the region?</p><p>FLOCK: We have found, at least in one case that N Bonanza, the ship that I showed you the picture of --</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>FLOCK: -- that actually is headed to Singapore. So they are able to redirect some of it. But right now, the sorghum market on the gulf coast, which is where a lot of it comes from, completely bottomed out. I mean, there's nobody that's buying in sorghum. So if you're sitting on sorghum, you're sitting on a pile of nothing right at the moment.</p><p>WEBSTER: Not good. All right, Jeff Flock, thank you so much. Jeff out in the field in Illinois.</p><p>FLOCK: Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER: Bernie Sanders, well, he molded to the mainstream. Now more Democratic candidates are calling themselves socialists. But is this really where the Democratic Party wants to go? We'll debate that, next.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, guess what? Socialism is apparently becoming mainstream in the wake of the Bernie Sanders campaign and in response to the resistance against Donald Trump. Growing number of candidates are, well, running as socialists.</p><p>The National Party, the Democratic Socialists of America has growing from about 5000 members back in 2016 to 35,000 nationwide. All right, interesting development.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel now. Democratic Strategist John Summers and Republican Strategist Boyd Matheson.</p><p>John, let me begin with you. You know, I lived through the socialist era of Britain in the 1970s. It was a disaster. And I'm very glad I will never have to go through that again, at least, I thought so. Now we're hearing this \"s\" word come up again.</p><p>Why is socialism seen as answer especially among millennials?</p><p>JON SUMMERS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think what we're saying is people who are tired of the same old, same law, I think they're seeing they haven't been represented by Washington very well at all. I mean, we see this on both sides of the political spectrum. People are dissatisfied. This is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was elected.</p><p>I think the midterms will show that there are still a lot of possibilities. He told them what they wanted to hear.</p><p>But now, we actually have candidates who feeling bold to stand up for the things they believe in like, healthcare for all, raising the minimum wage, things that strengthen the middle class, because a stronger middle class is a stronger America.</p><p>WEBSTER: Boyd, I've always seen socialism as wanting something for nothing. You know, I look at East Germany, West Germany. I look at Cuba, South Miami. I look at North Korea, South Korea.</p><p>I know where the people are trying to get out. And I know where they're trying to go, and it's generally from socialist countries to capitalist countries. And I think that says it all. What say you?</p><p>BOYD MATHESON, OPINION EDITOR, DESERET NEWS: Yes. Well, obviously the biggest problem with socialism that eventually you do run out of other people's money and then everything breaks down and you have to flee. But I do think the point is right in terms of neither party have given people a reason to be part of the party, especially millennials. They're not getting it.</p><p>And I think many of the polls show that millennials actually associate with the term socialism but most of them don't know what it really means. And when they start having jobs, and start seeing how much of their paycheck automatically vanishes to the federal government, then they start having a problem.</p><p>And so I think what you're going to see is, many of these Democrats who are using the socialist label, they're going to get labeled as beyond Bernie's. People don't know what socialism is, but they know what is beyond Bernie Sanders. So they'll be the beyond Bernie folks. And it's fine.</p><p>Socialism is fine for a Democratic primary in the spring but it does not fly in a real election in the fall. And I think that's going to be the challenge Democrats will face, much like the Republicans have on the right with some of those more extreme candidates.</p><p>WEBSTER: What do you say, John? I mean, there are those that say the Democrat Party is out of touch with the working people. And that's what Donald Trump tapped into. And if they go too far left, do you alienate more than you attract?</p><p>SUMMERS: Well, I think Boyd and I agree on a lot of the same things, believe it or not.</p><p>WEBSTER: What?</p><p>SUMMERS: I think it would be difficult to run as a socialist, you know, but I think he is right, I think that a lot of peoples especially millennials aren't familiar with exactly what that term means. I think what they're actually looking for is something different. They're looking for economic equity. They're looking for people who are willing to stand up for what they believe in. Not only just talk the talk, but actually walk the walk, and look out for things like increasing the minimum wage and income equality and that sort of thing.</p><p>WEBSTER: But, Boyd, from a Republican point of view, you've got to like this? Don't you think that the further left, the Democrats want to go, the better it may be for more mainstream America in the Republican Party, perhaps?</p><p>MATHESON: You know, I think the country is going to continue to remain center left, center right. It's going to be in that wheelhouse. I do think one of the things that the Democrats have tapped into is this misconception of capitalism and crony capitalism. And if the Republicans don't take on the crony part of that, they'll continue to struggle and have that problem as well.</p><p>I think <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>went in talking about, you know, getting rid of the swamp and the cronyism component of that, which does give unfair advantage to the wealthy and well-connected. There is a reason why six out of the 10 wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington D.C.</p><p>So it is a narrative that does swing both ways. I don't think Republicans should be comfortable on anything at this point and neither should the Democrats because we could see a real shift.</p><p>WESBTER: Right.</p><p>MATHESON: You could see the millennials come out in force for smaller parties, some of these broken smaller fragmented parties and that would really change the game. Because they will be probably over 50 percent of the votes come November.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Well --</p><p>MATHESON: I probably agree and I think -- oh sorry.</p><p>WEBSTER: -- we're out of time, guys. You're just to way too agreeable. That's the problem with this. I never thought I would see it, but I did.</p><p>John and Boyd, we're out of time. Thanks so much. We'll find an issue you can go at it next time, I promise.</p><p>And we'll be right back with more Intel.</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, as we reported, the suspect in Sunday's Waffle House shooting in Nashville, Tennessee has been arrested. Police say 29-year-old Travis Reinking was taken into custody in a wooded area not far from for his apartment. Police and federal agents making the arrest after a massive manhunt. Reinking was reportedly nearly naked when he opened fire at the Waffle House killing four people.</p><p>A news conference by the way has been has been scheduled for the next hour.</p><p>The market as we're talking it now is down 109 point. I also want to bring you up to speed on the Canadian story. In Toronto, the driver of the van plowing into at least eight pedestrians is also in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind the crash but police say the van apparently jump the curb and then hit pass it or hit the people walking down the street in the middle of Toronto. Busy news day.</p><p>Liz Claman, I'll throw it to you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INTELR-2018042301cb232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5P-63H1-JB20-G2SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437067</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7626\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>INTELLIGENCE REPORT</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 23, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0004J26</classCode><className>WEBSTER LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS111335 TREE NUT FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS111219 OTHER VEGETABLE (EXCEPT POTATO) &amp;

He will take you to the next hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Every day is a busy day, Charles.   Thank you very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PAYNE:  All right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WEBSTER:  Breaking right now, French President Emmanuel Macron just landing  at Joint Base Andrews as he begins a three-day state visit hosted by  President Trump.  We're also keeping an eye on your money, of course, as  U.S. Treasury yields creep towards three percent, which is sparking new  fears of a bear market on Wall Street.  We shall see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome.  I'm Ashley Webster in for Trish  Regan and on now to THE INTELLIGENCE REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump and Macron will look to strengthen their, well, bromance if  you like as both men have a lot riding on this week's visit where trade and  the Iran nuclear deal are set to dominate the agenda.  I'll be discussing  this with former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee straight ahead.</p><p>Plus, of course, North Korea says it will suspend all nuclear tests ahead  of its historic summit with South Korea.  President Trump tweeting this,  \"We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work  out, and maybe they won't.  Only time will tell.\"  We have more on that  coming up.</p><p>Lots to talk about.  But, first, French President Emmanuel Macron as we say  just landing on American soil, now is making his way to Washington to meet  with President Trump.  Do we have Fox -- do we have -- he's good.  We have  Fox News's Doug McKelway.  He's at the White House with more on the big  state visit.</p><p>Doug.</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  That's right, Ashley.   President Macron touched down at Joint Base Andrews just within the past  hour.  And his motorcade as we speak is just pulled up to Blair House about  a block away he and the First Lady of France will stay there for the next  couple of hours before they come here to the White House, board a  helicopter with the first couple of the United States for a trip across the  Potomac River where they will dine at the George Washington's Mount Vernon  tonight before the first state dinner of the Trump administration which  takes place here at the White House tomorrow.</p><p>These two get along famously as best as we can tell that they came  evidently as early as last summer when President Trump went to Paris to  enjoy Bastille Day, and came away from that meeting, having a very close  personal relationship with Mr. Macron.  He also came away from that meeting  suggesting we have a military parade here in the United States.  That is  not to say that they're not considerable differences between the two  gentlemen.</p><p>May 12th, for example, is a deadline for Mr. Trump to decide whether to  lift sanctions on Iran.  The press secretary was asked about that just in  the briefing a few moments ago, which is now underway.  Here is what she  had to say, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  But what you do have  are two leaders who have a great deal of respect for one another, who have  a great friendship.  Certainly, both have a great deal of interests in  doing what is best for their country, but being able to have very open and  candid conversations because of the relationship not only that the leaders  have built, but that has existed between the two countries long before  either of these individuals arrived on the scene.  And we're going to  continue that relationship.  But I think we can expect this to be a very  productive and very positive state visit for both countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  She added that she does not want to get ahead of any discussions  that two might have before they actually occur.  Macron, however, does  believes that it would be a bad decision to get out of the Iran nuclear  deal.  Here's what he had to say this weekend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMMANUEL MACRON, PRESIDENT OF FRANCE:  Is this agreement perfect and this  JCPOA perfect thing for our relationship with Iran?  No.  But for nuclear,  what do you have as a better option?  I don't see it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  And May 1st is another important deadline, a time for Mr. Trump  to decide whether he wants to impose tariffs on the European Union for its  importation of steel and aluminum.  Again, Mr. Macron thinks that would be  a bad idea for Mr. Trump to do.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACRON:  You cannot make a trade your allies.  I'm very -- I'm an easy guy.   I'm very simple.  I'm straight forward.</p><p>It's too complicated if you make war against everybody.  You make trade war  against China, trade war against Europe, war in Syria, war against Iran.   Come on.  It doesn't work.  You need allies.  We are the ally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  The First Lady coming out of the shadows a little bit for this  state dinner tonight.  She is apparently behind all of the minute planning  of this first state dinner coming tomorrow night.  The first state dinner  of the Trump administration.</p><p>Ashley, back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It's going to be quite an affair.  Doug McKelway at the White  House.  Doug, thank you very much.</p><p>MCKELWAY:  My pleasure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Joining me now to talk about that and other issues, FormerArkansas Governor Mike Huckabee.  Great to see you, Governor.</p><p>You know what politics can makes for strange bedfellows, and here we have  maybe Mr. Trump's lone ally in Europe right now because he's had a public  spat with Theresa May and the U.K.  And here we have Emmanuel Macron, who  by all accounts is a political outsider who also managed to outwit the  political establishment in France.  So maybe it's not so strange that these  two individuals kind of get along?</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR:  Well, I think a lot of it has  to do with what you just mentioned.  They're both outsiders, but they're  also very plain-spoken people.  And they're honest with each other.  The  President likes that.  He really does.</p><p>For all those who think that he wants to be surrounded by yes men, they  don't know him very well.  He doesn't like to be ridiculed in public but he  does not mind having people in the meetings with him speak their mind.   Clearly, President Macron is able, willing to do that.  They have very  frank and open discussions.</p><p>And the good thing is, look at this.  I think it's the best relationship  we've seen with France in many years.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  And we didn't even have to bring James Taylor in to sing for it.</p><p>WEBSTER:  I love the sarcasm.  It's an effective form of wit despite what  Stuart Varney says.  OK.  So, look, you know they're going to be talking,  Governor, about, you know, militarily ironically.</p><p>France has been right with the U.S., both against ISIS and in Syria.  But  then we have the nuke deal with Iran.  We have trade.  We have climate  change.</p><p>Can they get any common ground?  Because I don't think the President is  going to say, \"He's kind of hinted yes, OK, maybe we can get back into the  Paris climate accord.\"  I don't see that happening.  And with regard to the  Iran nuke deal, we heard Macron speaking this weekend.  It doesn't feel  like they're going to get any common ground there.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  They maybe not, Ashley.  But I think that there is a likelihood  that there will be some compromise on both parties to bring something to  the table that works.  But the President has been very clear.  He's  President of the United States.</p><p>He doesn't capitulate to any other country.  He does what's best for  America.  And he expects every other world leader to do the exact same  thing for their country.</p><p>But if he can be convinced whether it's by Macron or one of the others that  this is really in the best interests of the United States I think he is  open to it.  But I'll be very clear to say, if it's not in the best  interests of the United States he's not interested at all.  This President  is not in simply trying to be popular with world leaders.  He wants to be  effective in making sure that he takes care of America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely true.  OK, we're gong to completely change gears.  Now  I want to ask you about this one.  Canadian country singer Shania Twain  issuing an apology after getting a lot of backlash for saying she would  have voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election.</p><p>I mean, how could she say such a thing?  What are your thoughts?</p><p>HUCKABEE:  It's so sad that the left refuses to allow anyone to speak his  or her mind without being just pilloried and excoriated unless they agree  with the left of center viewpoint that they hold.  This is the most  intolerant bunch of people I've ever seen in my life, Ashley, and this is a  great example.</p><p>You know, it's sad that Shania Twain felt like she had to apologize, but  the backlash that she got for simply expressing an opinion, why can't she  do that?  She ought to be able to.  Tragic day.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes, exactly.  We've seen it, you know, certainly coming out of  Hollywood in the movie business.  No different, I guess, in the music  business as well.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Too bad and it's unfortunate.  We need to be able to have the  kind of honest discussions that we're seeing between the French and  American President where we don't always agree but we do it respectfully.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very well-said.  Governor Huckabee, thank you so much for joining  us today.  I really appreciate it.</p><p>HUCKABEE:  Thanks.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets for you.  Stocks  just slightly lower as Wall Street kicks off its biggest week for corporate  earnings.  The Dow off 57 points, and we start lows earnings today with  Google after the closing bell today, or Alphabet, the parent company.</p><p>Let's get down to the floor of the New York Stock Exchange where our own  Nicole Petallides has the latest.  Nicole.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Hey, good afternoon, Ashley.  So,  as you noted, we're watching for Google after the bell.  We're taking a  look at the broader market right now, and you do see all down arrows with  the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 64 points after some choppy  trading, down volume, slightly ahead of up volume.  And the Dow, the NASDAQ  and the S&amp;P all lower today, but for the month, in the green.</p><p>Interestingly enough, we've seen oil pulling just slightly higher now after  having being down.  But the dollar and Treasury yields have been a big  story, taking a look at 10-year Treasury, which on Friday was settling at  highest levels since January 2014.</p><p>Look at this, getting closer to that very psychological level of three  percent.  Two point ninety-eight percent right now for the 10-year bond  yield.  Of course, as that moves higher we'll watch for that.</p><p>Taking a look at the tech earnings, I want to get to that quickly.   AlphabetGoogle is slightly lower.  Facebook, Amazon, Intel, Microsoft, all  of these this week, it is going to be a huge week for tech earnings.  And I  spoke with Joel Kulina over at Wedbush and he basically said, clearly,  large cap tech has taking somewhat of a hit.  But most of the investors  will be looking at these, looking at the capital return announcements on  all of them.</p><p>And, of course, regulatory overhang for the names, such as Facebook and  Google.  They gave me a lot on each one of them.  We'll break it down  throughout each of the hits, but we'll see all down arrows right now,  Google after the bell.  We'll have to see it here.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Another busy week for you, Nicole.  Thank you so much.   Appreciate it.  Nicole, make sure to watch \"After the Bell,\" at 4:00 p.m.  Eastern today for the latest earnings report from Alphabet/Google right  here on Fox Business.</p><p>All right.  Coming up, we'll have more on these markets as, yes, as Nicole  said the 10-year Treasury yield is nearing at magical three percent.  Is it  magical or is it a nightmare?  We'll find out.</p><p>Plus, new questions about the Russia investigation.  House Intelligence  Chairman Devin Nunes revealing that there was no official intelligence used  to start that probe into the Trump campaign.  We'll have the intel later in  the show.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  A lot of breaking news to bring you right now.  Let's begin with  news from the Nashville Police Department, which says the suspect in the  Waffle House shooting there has been taken into custody just moments ago.   So that's an update there.</p><p>Meanwhile, north of the border, several people in Toronto had been hurt  after a white van reportedly plowed into a group of pedestrians.  The  extent of injuries on whether it was intentional or an accident is still  not known.  We're told that at least eight people are said to have been hit  by that white van.  Of course, we'll keep monitoring all of the stories and  bring you the very latest updates as they become available.</p><p>Let's get back to politics.  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announcing he  supports CIA Director Mike Pompeo to be the next Secretary of State,  tweeting this.  \"After meeting with Mike Pompeo, discussing his foreign  policy perspectives and considering his distinguished time as CIA Director  and his exemplary career in public service, I will vote to confirm Mike  Pompeo to be our next Secretary of State.\"</p><p>Now Manchin is the second Democrat to support Pompeo's nomination, possibly  giving him some momentum ahead of a showdown vote in the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee.  That panel, though, poised to vote against Pompeo.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this, American Progress Action Fund Larry Korb.   All right.  Larry, why this unprecedented rebuke of Mike Pompeo?  Is it  just purely obstructionism?  What's the play here?</p><p>LARRY KORB, SENIOR FELLOW, AMERICAN PROGRESS ACTION FUND:  Well, I think a  lot of the people, including Republican Rand Paul are concerned that his  positions will reinforce President Trump's worst tendencies and they want  someone who will serve, you know, as a counterweight.  And I don't think  Director Pompeo has helped himself by not telling the members of the  committee off-line, you know, about his North Korean trip because this is  theoretically acting like a Secretary of State before you get there.  But,  as you pointed out, he will be confirmed.</p><p>And, you know, people talk about it.  People forget when Chuck Hagel,  Senator Hagel went up to be Secretary of Defense under President Obama, he  only got three Republican votes on the floor.  So this is not unprecedented  for people to use this to make another point.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you could argue, Larry, that the point that Mr. Pompeo didn't  tell anyone or told the least amount of people possible is that it's a  chronic place for leaking information.  And there's one thing they didn't  want was for that visit to Pyongyang to come out before he went there and  came back.  And then we could talk about it, but he didn't want that to be  known to the general public.  And Washington is a place for leaks.</p><p>KORB:  No, but I think when he came back he should have briefed them off- line because, again, the worst thing you do -- well, I remember my own  experience, if you start acting like you got the job before you are  confirmed, a lot of people will not take that very well.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So you do believe he'll get through the full Senate?</p><p>KORB:  I think he will because you've already got, at least two Democrats.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>KORB:  And so, I think he will.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Could it unsettle the North Korean negotiations effort?  Is their  timing on this pretty poor?</p><p>KORB:  No, I don't think so.  And I think, you know, basically, his trip  was the right thing to do, or somebody should have gone, you know, to talk  to the North Koreans who lay the groundwork.  And today, over the weekend  we've seen some public back and forth, and I think once sensible thing the  administration has said is, they're not going to make any concessions just  because he stopped doing what he's doing.  He's going to have to start  dismantling stuff before we relax the economic sanctions.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And that's going to be the key elements, one, nuke, you know,  dismantlement.  But, first, the timetable for the sanctions comes after  that, which really puts the ball in the court of North Korea.  I guess the  fact that we're talking is very positive, but we have to have a pretty  hefty amount of skepticism when we look at this as well.</p><p>KORB:  Yes.  I mean the North Koreans promised several times going back to  the 1990s that they're going to do something that they didn't do it.  So  you not only wanted to start dismantling it, you want to have intrusive  inspections much like we have, for example, in Iran where they can go in  and check and see that he's living up to the deal.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Do you think President Trump's unconventional approach, the  tweets, the \"rocket man\" references, all of that have kind of  discombobulated Pyongyang a little bit and that's what's got us to this  point?</p><p>KORB:  I think the key thing was the sanctions.  I give President Trump for  giving much tougher sanctions than we have before because we got the  international community, particularly the Chinese and Russians to go along.   Now, they may have been concerned that, you know, President Trump might do  something erratic.</p><p>But the fact in the matter those sanctions are starting to hurt, and that's  why he has stopped this program because he has gotten as far as he wants  to.  He has the capability.  The question is now, are you going to you  limit that capability.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Ten seconds, Larry.  Are you confident we can get something out  of this summit?</p><p>KORB:  I think we can because, again, I think the sanctions are beginning  to bite and I think that he recognizes that this is once in a lifetime  opportunity, not only with us, but a very liberal government in South  Korea.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Good point.  Well, we shall see, as they say.  Larry Korb,  thank you so much.  Larry, appreciate it.</p><p>KORB:  Thanks for having me.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Let's take a look at these markets.  We're being down  slightly lower on the Dow.  We're off 85 points, now maybe getting a little  momentum on the downside.  We'll have more on the markets and what's moving  them on the intel right after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  We want to get back now to that story out of Toronto as we're  getting more information.  The driver of a white van, a white Ryder van  plowing into at least eight to 10 pedestrians on the sidewalk.  That driver  now in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind this.  Police say  the van apparently jumped the curb.  This is all happening as Cabinet  ministers from the G7 countries are gathered in Toronto right now ahead of  June summit in Quebec.</p><p>Eyewitnesses saying it appeared the driver did indeed deliberately tried to  hit people on the sidewalk.  But, again, we don't know what's the motive  for this yet, but the suspect is in custody.</p><p>Let's get back to the markets.  Stocks are at sessions lows as the 10-year  Treasury yield hovers right around its highest level in four years, now  closing in on three percent causing economists who worry about rising,  borrowing costs.</p><p>Joining me now is MaxFund.com Founder Jonas Ferris along with Surevest  Wealth Management CEO Rob Luna.</p><p>All right.  Jonas, let me begin with you.  Why is three percent on the 10- year such a psychological level?  Surely, we can handle three percent  because historically that's still really low?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOUNDER, MAXFUND.COM:  Historically it's low.  It is less  psychologically useful than like Dow 10,000 was technically meaningless and  20,000.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just a price index on stocks.  That's an arbitrary.  The  whole -- you know, you're borrowing money at these rates and you're  investing money at these rates.  So, like it means something to  institutional investors and retail investors.</p><p>You know, people might not take a mortgage if it breaks a certain threshold  in their head or a car loan.  That's why you see like 3.99 percent fines in  yields.  This is a meaningful threshold.  And a lot of buyers are coming in  at three.  And that's what happened for all of the last times you run up to  three over the last three years.</p><p>And a lot of demands for bonds when the rate gets a little higher.  It's  still low historically but it's a safe yield.  And, you know, the stock  market is high and it's very volatile as you've seen in recent months.</p><p>So there's been a lot of independent demand that comes in around three.   And maybe the government is selling hundreds of billions of dollars of debt  at this level, so we're very concerned, is it going to breach three and all  of a sudden it was going to panic and say, \"OK, the 30-year bull market in  Treasury is over and bonds is over?\"</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Then we go to 3.4, four, and that's when the real panic would  start.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Rob, I moved to the United States in 1982.  It was a  real steal if you got a mortgage for 16 percent.  So I have a hard time  panicking over this, but I get Jonas' point.  It's seems, Rob, that we're  trading in a range right now, especially with a perceived hawkish Fed in  background just waiting to raise rates.</p><p>ROB LUNA, CEO, SUREVEST WEALTH MANAGEMENT:  Yes, and that's exactly it,  Ashley.  I mean, we've seen that since the beginning of the year.  And I  really expect that to continue for the rest of the year.</p><p>You know, I've been seeing for a while the easy money is done in this  market.  And investors really need to change their playbook if they're  going to be able to generate returns.  And quite honestly, importantly,  mitigate the risk in their portfolio.</p><p>You know, the idea of 60/40 buy and hold portfolio where bonds are expected  to be that buffer to cushion at the downside of stocks as we've already  seen this year is not working.  And some of the more conservative investors  are the one actually taking the brunt of the storm.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we're going to find out the latest earnings from the big  tech companies this week.  We kick it off after the bell today with Google.   If we have a blowout performance by these big, big technology companies how  much impetus does that give to the market?</p><p>FERRIS:  It's helpful.  We saw that with Netflix recently.  But I think  that -- there's still a lot of fear that the underlying business model of a  Google and Facebook, which is largely based on privacy -- looking to  privacy and selling it off to advertisers, is under the spotlight.  And the  more we learn about those behaviors, the more we're concerned that there's  going to be a regulatory crackdown or there's a consumer revolt.  And it's  going to limit the earnings growth potential of these companies.</p><p>Even with good numbers right now, I think there's a lot -- there's enough  fear baked into that side of the FANG so-called equation which is, again,  largely based on selling targeted advertising and more as we learn every  week, we think there's new revelation what they're doing with your data  when you're not getting logged in.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  It's just absurd.  So, I think that's going to keep them in it.   We have not seen Apple phone sales as strong as people would like.  So  there's a lot of pressure in tech.  And a good earnings report isn't going  to take that away at this point.</p><p>It will be helpful like it was in Netflix, but at this point there's long- term fears there and that's why the three percent Treasury yield is  starting to look comforting to people --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- in the world of maybe tech companies aren't going to grow as  fast as they have.</p><p>WEBSTER:  True.  You know, Rob, we had an analyst on this morning on our  network who said the only thing that really worries him, he feels like  earnings are strong, the economy is humming along nicely, some sort of  geopolitical situation could really knock it off the axis.  Do you have  concerns like that?</p><p>LUNA:  Well, I mean, geopolitical concerns, Ashley, are always in our  outlook for the markets, and something that could happen at anytime.  So,  yes, if you see something like that, you know, I think part of the reason  we've calm down and we've had a positive month is because the rhetoric out  of North Korea is kind of calmed down quite a bit and we're starting to see  progress there.  So, if that starts to tick back up again, if earnings  don't come in that great, and you start to see this interest rates rise  above three percent, those are all going to provide headwinds for investors  in this market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Jonas, we'll play the what if game.  What if the Democrats take  back the House, does that have impact on the market?  Perhaps the less  business-friendly House, would that have that have an impact?</p><p>FERRIS:  I don't think that's a current concern because it wouldn't lead to  like tax cuts.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  You're not going to automatically have higher corporate tax rate  just because there's a power change.  So there would have to be such a huge  swing for there anything that affect what the market liked, which was the  tax package in recent years.</p><p>I think, you know, there's a positive and negative going on right now.   These rates are going up because the economy is strong, partially because  of tax cuts.  So, it's not like it's all bad that rates are going up.  The  question is do they go up so fast that it's faster, or does the Fed raise  rates too high and causes recession?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  That's what kind of the fears.  But, again, there's an underlying  strength here that people want to invest in, which is why the stock market  is still strong.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  People don't want to miss what could be an even longer bull  market.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So, Rob, could the tax cuts kind of counteract the rising  interest rates?</p><p>LUNA:  Yes, I think so.  And I think that's what where going to start  seeing, Ashley, out of companies as they're starting to report this  quarter.  And that's why expectations are so high for earnings.</p><p>But let's be careful, you know, I think Jeremy Siegel out of Lawrence  talked about this quite a bit, that a lot of this is going to be front-end  loaded.  You're getting this accelerated depreciation in assets.  But come  next year when all that sworn off, if companies can't generate good top- lines growth, I think you're going to see all of this taken back.</p><p>And I think investors are pretty smart that they're starting to look at  that now.  So even though companies are being in these expectations,  they're still a little bit skeptical if they're going to be able to  continue that especially in a rising interest rate environment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  You know, Jonas, it feels like we've lost the volatility that we  had just weeks ago where we were up 400, down another 500.  As I said to  Rob earlier on, we're now in this kind of a range which I think comforts  the average investor because that volatility can be very, you know, very  alarming.</p><p>FERRIS:  It was.  We had a few like eras of that since, but it's been, you  know, a pretty much non-stop, you know, bull market since early 2009.  So,  there's been, you know, there's the Greece problems of the debt bangs.   There's always been a volatility era.</p><p>Then it seems just go away when we go on to higher things.  But at this  point, it does seem like we're moving more sideways then we were going to  have to see that the economy can grow in spite so to say of higher rates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>FERRIS:  Because a lot of people also believe the opposite that rates are  going up because of the tax cuts possibly in a way to counter the benefit  of them.  And that's where we kind of watching for and, again, it's always  been the case where they raise rates too high.  Thinking the economy is too  hot, cause a recession.  You don't want to be sitting in a high P-E stock  portfolio when we go to next recession.  So that's kind of the fear.</p><p>And to your original point, you know, these home prices, when you are --  they need to be have mortgages --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- the home prices weren't based on having a three percent  mortgage.  So that's what's they've been concerned what happens when they  go back to six percent, because the home prices have to go right back down  to adjust to that or they're going to stay there --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Very good point.</p><p>FERRIS:  -- showing to the market right now.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Of course, I hope we don't drop suddenly 500 points as I've just  said.  Anyway, Jonas and Rob, thank you so much gentlemen for --</p><p>LUNA:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- talking about the markets with us.  Really appreciate it.</p><p>Let's get back now more on this breaking news out of Toronto as police say  a van hit at least eight people on the sidewalk, but any motive unknown at  this hour but we do know that the driver is in custody.</p><p>Fox News's Catherine Herridge, a native of Toronto, by the way, joins me  right now with more on this story.</p><p>Catherine, what are you hearing?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we're  waiting for some indication from the police as to the motivation of the  suspect and the identification of the suspect.  But having covered Homeland  Security now for 18 years, I can tell you a number of things really stand  out to me about the incident.</p><p>Number one, for those at home who are not familiar with Toronto, Young  Street is the main north-south artery running through the city.  It starts  at Lake Ontario.  And then it travels up dozens of miles to Northern  Ontario.  I think it may in fact be the longest street running north-south  in the entire country of Canada.</p><p>And this intersection with Finch Avenue is one of the major east-west  arteries.  And it's also one of the major hubs for the subway system there  known as the TTC, the Toronto Transit Commission.</p><p>So you have one of the major arteries in the city.  You also have coupled  with that, the subway system and then you also have the time of day, 1:30.   This is when people are finishing up their lunch hour and heading back to  work.  And this area is not only a business area but it's a heavily  residential area.  There are a lot of large condominium complexes up in  that part of Toronto with sort of what I would call smaller residential  neighborhoods, older neighborhoods off to the side.</p><p>So if the individual's motivation was to inflict a maximum number of  casualties, they really kind of checked all the boxes in this particular  situation, you know, a major artery for traffic, vehicular and pedestrian  traffic in Toronto.  Also the subway system, the time of day, and based on  the eyewitness reports that we're getting out of Toronto, the driver of the  white van was driving north on Young Street and went up on to the curb and  hit the pedestrians.</p><p>So they would have hit the pedestrians if you will, coming from behind in  many cases and they would have been driving, sort of, up on that major part  of the artery on Young Street.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Catherine, you know, we've seen this played out in London, in  Barcelona, in Berlin to your point, a main thoroughfare being targeted.   But seeing from the helicopter shots, it appears to be a white Ryder van or  rental van, which really plays into the M.O. of these terrorists.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Well, I mean, there are a lot of circumstantial pieces here to  the puzzle that point towards that, but I want to just be a cautious and  responsible because we don't know --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  -- who the suspect is or what their motivation is.  But  certainly, the person who drove that van, and it appears to be a rental  van, did so in a part of the city at a time of day near a subway  intersection where they would have a maximum sort of impact if you will in  terms of casualties.  And I think that that was certainly have the  attention of police and investigators in Toronto.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Absolutely.  Catherine Herridge, thank you very much for your  insight into this.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>WEBSTER:  We appreciate it.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  Sure.</p><p>WEBSTER:  And, of course, we will continue to follow with more details as  they become available in that incident in Toronto.</p><p>Devin Nunes says there was no official Intel to justify the Russian  investigation.  So how does a dossier funded by the opposition spur an FBI  probe?  We'll examine that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:  So we've  long wanted to know what intelligence that you have that actually led to  this investigation?  So what we found now, after the investigators have  reviewed it is that, in fact, there was no intelligence.</p><p>We now know that there was no official intelligence that was used to start  this investigation.  We know that Sidney Blumenthal and others were pushing  information into the State Department.  So we're trying to piece all of  that together.  And that's why we continue to look at the State Department.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Oh, what a tangled web we weave.  The man leading the House  Russian probe Intelligence Committee Chairman, Devin Nunes, right there  telling our Maria Bartiromo this weekend there was no intelligence used to  begin a probe into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  If  you're confused before, just to add to it now.</p><p>Joining me now, former Prosecutor David Bruno.  All right.  David, so to  Mr. Nunes' point, they applied for a FISA warrant based solely not as he  says on intel, no official intelligence.  But based on the dossier, the  information provided within that was funded by the Democratic National  Committee.  Correct?</p><p>DAVID BRUNO, FMR. PROSECUTOR AND CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  Well, correct.   And these are two different issues.  What Devin Nunes just talked about --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- is how the investigation was started.  We know that it was  started in July of 2016.  And it was started as a result of a conversation  that George Papadopoulos had with an Australian diplomat.</p><p>WEBSTER:  In the bar?</p><p>BRUNO:  Right, right.  So, in the Schiff Minority memorandum on FISA, they  point to that.  They say it wasn't Steele that initiated investigation.  It  was the Papadopoulos information.  What we found out is that the  information about the Papadopoulos statements didn't come through normal  channels.  We would expect that it would come through these five eyes  agreement, which is a partnership with Australia.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there are no reports, there's nothing to document that  information coming our way.  So the next question is, if it didn't come  through the proper channels --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Where did it come from?</p><p>BRUNO:  -- where did it come from?  That's what they're looking at.  That's  what important when it comes --</p><p>WEBSTER:  That you have a copy here, but it's redacted.  So we don't know  yet.</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  I have it and everyone is welcome to look at the Schiff FISA  memorandum.  It is a part of it where it says that wait a second, this is  not open based on Steele.  It's opened by the Papadopoulos information that  came from the Australians.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, listen, let's talk about Steele because a lot was being  made of this.  He was actually terminated by the FBI even though the  information that he accumulated for them was used?</p><p>BRUNO:  Sure.  He was terminated for leaking stuff to the press, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Correct.</p><p>BRUNO:  And there's arguments to be made that the information that he  provided to the press was also used in the FISA applications, which is  called circular reporting.  So the argument was made that, well, there's  press information that corroborates Steele, but Steele was the actual  source.  A lot to be made, let's not forget, there are multiple referrals  to the DOJ and the FBI as Steele was a target of criminal investigation.   It could come to that.</p><p>WEBSTER:  So all we've heard is Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, nothing yet  of any substance at all.  How long does this go on, and is it to the point  where they're going to have to find something to justify everything that's  come up to this point?</p><p>BRUNO:  Nobody knows how long.  I mean --</p><p>WEBSTER:  But you said --</p><p>BRUNO:  -- how -- now, it could go on into finances.  It could go on into  past history.  We've seen that in the Gates-Manafort indictment, right?</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right, yes.</p><p>BRUNO:  That had nothing to do with Russian collusion, it was money  laundering, it was tax related information.  So how far can he go on?  He  could go on for a while?  Hopefully for the country's sake, for our market  sake, for all of our sake --</p><p>WEBSTER:  This is bond.</p><p>BRUNO:  -- it will end quickly.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right, we're already out of time but, David Bruno, thank you  so much.</p><p>BRUNO:  Good to see you, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  It can make your eyes glaze over.  That's for sure.  But we're  staying up with it.  David, thank you very much.</p><p>OK, this may be a possible sign of things to come.  Five ships carrying  more than $200 million worth of U.S. sorghum changed course in the ocean  after China announced massive tariffs.</p><p>Jeff Flock, following the story from this side of the pacific where it will  have an impact, right, Jeff?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  You said it, yes, yes, sir.  You know,  it's planting time.  It's spring planting season out here, and this field  was -- when I'm walking through here and now maybe you can tell because  there's corn litter.  This was corn.  But if you're thinking about planting  sorghum, sorghum that feed grain, farmers maybe having second thoughts  about that.</p><p>I want to show you a picture of one of the ships you're talking about,  Ashley.  And that was a ship called the N Bonanza.  It was one of 20 ships  loaded with sorghum being sent to China.  We export about 80 percent of our  sorghum grown in this country to China about a billion dollars worth last  year, $2 billion worth just a couple years ago.</p><p>And those ships as you point out, many of them turned around because the  tariff was 179 percent that to retaliate against President Trump's tariffs.   As you can imagine, if you're charging almost double a tax on what you  already paid for the sorghum, pretty much, that's not really a winning  deal.</p><p>So, what can I tell you?  Sorghum farmers in the Midwest places like  Kansas, which is the number one sorghum state, pretty upset about that.  I  want to give you a quote from, I think, it's from -- well, I was going to  give you a quote from Pat Toomey who said, this is collateral damage.  But  actually, this is one from the Chinese.  </p><p>You know they say, the reason they put these tariffs on is because the U.S.  was dumping cheap sorghum into their market.  The reality is, we actually  were selling to China because they were paying a premium for our sorghum,  not cheap sorghum.  In fact, one of the Chinese companies said, even though  this price is very high, we still want to import.  We think more and more  sorghum will come into China and we will buy and import sorghum also.  That  was all before all of this trade business started.</p><p>So, I know we say it's not a trade war.  But I'll tell you, it's a battle  certainly.  And it's one that's already claiming some casualties.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Jeff, very quickly, what happens to all that sorghum out in  the ocean?  I mean, do you bring it back or do you try and find another  buyer somewhere in the region?</p><p>FLOCK:  We have found, at least in one case that N Bonanza, the ship that I  showed you the picture of --</p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.</p><p>FLOCK:  -- that actually is headed to Singapore.  So they are able to  redirect some of it.  But right now, the sorghum market on the gulf coast,  which is where a lot of it comes from, completely bottomed out.  I mean,  there's nobody that's buying in sorghum.  So if you're sitting on sorghum,  you're sitting on a pile of nothing right at the moment.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Not good.  All right, Jeff Flock, thank you so much.  Jeff out in  the field in Illinois.</p><p>FLOCK:  Thanks, Ashley.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Bernie Sanders, well, he molded to the mainstream.  Now more  Democratic candidates are calling themselves socialists.  But is this  really where the Democratic Party wants to go?  We'll debate that, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, guess what?  Socialism is apparently becoming mainstream in  the wake of the Bernie Sanders campaign and in response to the resistance  against Donald Trump.  Growing number of candidates are, well, running as  socialists.</p><p>The National Party, the Democratic Socialists of America has growing from  about 5000 members back in 2016 to 35,000 nationwide.  All right,  interesting development.</p><p>Let's bring in the political panel now.  Democratic Strategist John Summers  and Republican Strategist Boyd Matheson.</p><p>John, let me begin with you.  You know, I lived through the socialist era  of Britain in the 1970s.  It was a disaster.  And I'm very glad I will  never have to go through that again, at least, I thought so.  Now we're  hearing this \"s\" word come up again.</p><p>Why is socialism seen as answer especially among millennials?</p><p>JON SUMMERS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, I think what we're saying is  people who are tired of the same old, same law, I think they're seeing they  haven't been represented by Washington very well at all.  I mean, we see  this on both sides of the political spectrum.  People are dissatisfied.   This is one of the reasons why Donald Trump was elected.</p><p>I think the midterms will show that there are still a lot of possibilities.   He told them what they wanted to hear.</p><p>But now, we actually have candidates who feeling bold to stand up for the  things they believe in like, healthcare for all, raising the minimum wage,  things that strengthen the middle class, because a stronger middle class is  a stronger America.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Boyd, I've always seen socialism as wanting something for  nothing.  You know, I look at East Germany, West Germany.  I look at Cuba,  South Miami.  I look at North Korea, South Korea.</p><p>I know where the people are trying to get out.  And I know where they're  trying to go, and it's generally from socialist countries to capitalist  countries.  And I think that says it all.  What say you?</p><p>BOYD MATHESON, OPINION EDITOR, DESERET NEWS:  Yes.  Well, obviously the  biggest problem with socialism that eventually you do run out of other  people's money and then everything breaks down and you have to flee.  But I  do think the point is right in terms of neither party have given people a  reason to be part of the party, especially millennials.  They're not  getting it.</p><p>And I think many of the polls show that millennials actually associate with  the term socialism but most of them don't know what it really means.  And  when they start having jobs, and start seeing how much of their paycheck  automatically vanishes to the federal government, then they start having a  problem.</p><p>And so I think what you're going to see is, many of these Democrats who are  using the socialist label, they're going to get labeled as beyond Bernie's.   People don't know what socialism is, but they know what is beyond Bernie  Sanders.  So they'll be the beyond Bernie folks.  And it's fine.</p><p>Socialism is fine for a Democratic primary in the spring but it does not  fly in a real election in the fall.  And I think that's going to be the  challenge Democrats will face, much like the Republicans have on the right  with some of those more extreme candidates.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What do you say, John?  I mean, there are those that say the  Democrat Party is out of touch with the working people.  And that's what  Donald Trump tapped into.  And if they go too far left, do you alienate  more than you attract?</p><p>SUMMERS:  Well, I think Boyd and I agree on a lot of the same things,  believe it or not.</p><p>WEBSTER:  What?</p><p>SUMMERS:  I think it would be difficult to run as a socialist, you know,  but I think he is right, I think that a lot of peoples especially  millennials aren't familiar with exactly what that term means.  I think  what they're actually looking for is something different.  They're looking  for economic equity.  They're looking for people who are willing to stand  up for what they believe in.  Not only just talk the talk, but actually  walk the walk, and look out for things like increasing the minimum wage and  income equality and that sort of thing.</p><p>WEBSTER:  But, Boyd, from a Republican point of view, you've got to like  this?  Don't you think that the further left, the Democrats want to go, the  better it may be for more mainstream America in the Republican Party,  perhaps?</p><p>MATHESON:  You know, I think the country is going to continue to remain  center left, center right.  It's going to be in that wheelhouse.  I do  think one of the things that the Democrats have tapped into is this  misconception of capitalism and crony capitalism.  And if the Republicans  don't take on the crony part of that, they'll continue to struggle and have  that problem as well.</p><p>I think President Trump went in talking about, you know, getting rid of the  swamp and the cronyism component of that, which does give unfair advantage  to the wealthy and well-connected.  There is a reason why six out of the 10  wealthiest counties in America are suburbs of Washington D.C.</p><p>So it is a narrative that does swing both ways.  I don't think Republicans  should be comfortable on anything at this point and neither should the  Democrats because we could see a real shift.</p><p>WESBTER:  Right.</p><p>MATHESON:  You could see the millennials come out in force for smaller  parties, some of these broken smaller fragmented parties and that would  really change the game.  Because they will be probably over 50 percent of  the votes come November.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Well --</p><p>MATHESON:  I probably agree and I think -- oh sorry.</p><p>WEBSTER:  -- we're out of time, guys.  You're just to way too agreeable.   That's the problem with this.  I never thought I would see it, but I did.</p><p>John and Boyd, we're out of time.  Thanks so much.  We'll find an issue you  can go at it next time, I promise.</p><p>And we'll be right back with more Intel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, as we reported, the suspect in Sunday's Waffle House  shooting in Nashville, Tennessee has been arrested.  Police say 29-year-old  Travis Reinking was taken into custody in a wooded area not far from for  his apartment.  Police and federal agents making the arrest after a massive  manhunt.  Reinking was reportedly nearly naked when he opened fire at the  Waffle House killing four people.</p><p>A news conference by the way has been has been scheduled for the next hour.</p><p>The market as we're talking it now is down 109 point.  I also want to bring  you up to speed on the Canadian story.  In Toronto, the driver of the van  plowing into at least eight pedestrians is also in custody.</p><p>Toronto police not revealing any calls or motive behind the crash but  police say the van apparently jump the curb and then hit pass it or hit the  people walking down the street in the middle of Toronto.  Busy news day.</p><p>Liz Claman, I'll throw it to you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

If the deal goes ahead, Orange said it intends to develop a fully mobile banking service under the Orange Bank brand.</p><p>\"They could be a threat to the traditional banks,\" said Yann Ranchere, a partner at Anthemis, an investment firm specializing in fintech that has invested in startups like the Azimo money transfer firm and the mobile-only Atom Bank. Orange already has some experience in financial services via its Orange Money payments and transfer service, which operates in Africa and initially targeted people without bank accounts, Ranchere noted.</p><p>The company also launched Orange Finanse in Poland in 2014, in partnership with mBank SA, Poland's fourth-largest lender.</p><p>\"The outside view may be that it's Orange the telco getting into a financial services player, but it could also be presented as Orange the financial services player expanding their offering in Europe,\" he told SNL Financial.</p><p>Although Groupama's banking operation reported assets of only (EURO)4.34 billion in the third quarter of 2015 - next to nothing compared to the total $8.73 trillion in assets of the French banking system as a whole at the end of 2014 - the deal would provide Orange with a banking license. And a small starting size could actually be an advantage for Orange, which won't have to deal with expensive legacy systems.</p><p>Atom Bank, in which Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA is taking a 29.5% share, says mobile-only banks can achieve cost-to-income ratios of as low as 28%, compared to over 50% for even the most efficient traditional lenders. But Orange's immediate ambitions are modest: It is targeting only (EURO)400 million of revenues from financial services by 2018.</p><p>The company may find banking a tough business, said Alex Koagne, analyst at Natixis, who told SNL that just reaching a large number of customers does not equate to profits unless these include a high proportion of the most financially solvent. And many of these more profitable clients are older and less prone to use digital services, he observed.</p><p>The existing banks will also fight back by continuing to expand their own digital offerings, Koagne said, while other technology companies occasionally mooted as potential banks, such as Google and Facebook, may prefer to limit their financial activities to services such as payments, rather than creating fully regulated banks.</p><p>Big tech companies could also collaborate with financial services firms in deals that enable them to make use of their customer reach and data without having to put up the capital themselves, Ranchere said. In one such arrangement, Amazon started offering consumer loans to its U.K. customers in December 2015, but tapped Hitachi Capital to provide the service.</p><p>Koagne said traditional banks will also, if necessary, buy into fintech companies before they become a threat, as BBVA did with Atom, and could resort to cannibalizing their own businesses by transferring customers to their newer digital brands.</p><p>BNP Paribas SA operates its Hello bank! in four countries, while Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA hopes to roughly triple the number of clients of its online bank, Boursorama SA, to more than 2 million by 2020.\u00a0 Groupama Banque had 530,000 customers at the end of 2015.</p><p>\"It's too early to be enthusiastic about what Orange is doing,\" said Koagne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLEFD-35019610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLEFD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HV8-PCJ1-JDVW-N476-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">375841</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL European Financials Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 11, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0001SGS</classCode><className>ORANGE SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0005HIV</classCode><className>GROUPAMA SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000DEQA</classCode><className>MBANK SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002755</classCode><className>BANCO BILBAO VIZCAYA ARGENTARIA SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009TCH</classCode><className>NATIXIS SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS524113 DIRECT LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC6311 LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS522220 SALES FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

In one such arrangement, Amazon started offering consumer loans to its U.K. customers in December 2015, but tapped Hitachi Capital to provide the service.</p><p>Koagne said traditional banks will also, if necessary, buy into fintech companies before they become a threat, as BBVA did with Atom, and could resort to cannibalizing their own businesses by transferring customers to their newer digital brands.</p><p>BNP Paribas SA operates its Hello bank! in four countries, while Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale SA hopes to roughly triple the number of clients of its online bank, Boursorama SA, to more than 2 million by 2020.\u00a0 GroupamaBanque had 530,000 customers at the end of 2015.</p><p>\"It's too early to be enthusiastic about what Orange is doing,\" said Koagne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-35019610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HV8-PCJ1-JDVW-N4DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

By trading accusations, Facebook and Apple could just be handing more ammo to critics and regulators \u2014 but at the same time, conflict between these giants could be read as a sign of competitive life and a rebuttal to antitrust charges.Driving the news: A new version of Apple' iOS limits the use of some kinds of user-tracking tech that advertisers on Facebook use to target individuals, and last week Facebook warned[1] that the change would reduce the ads' effectiveness and cut into revenue. At a Thursday companywide meeting, per Buzzfeed[2], Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Apple has a \"unique stranglehold as a gatekeeper on what gets on phones,' that it \"blocks innovation, blocks competition' and 'charge[s] monopoly rents.'Zuckerberg's charge follows a number of high-profile cases in which app developers \u2014 including the maker of the phenomenally popular game Fortnite \u2014 have challenged Apple's rules[3] for controlling App Store revenue. </p><p>The big picture: Facebook, as the owner of the world's largest social network, has also become a key source by which Americans get their news and entertainment. But Apple, with products like Apple News, Apple News+, and Apple TV+, is competing to be an information destination.Apple has made the iPhone the most popular high-end phone brand in the U.S., though it splits the overall market with Android. That lets Apple wield a tight grip on software makers' access to the most lucrative customers. But some third-party developers have long complained that Apple throws its weight around, and Facebook has now joined them. Between the lines: For years, Apple's biggest enemy in Silicon Valley was Google, which created the Android operating system that took off after the iPhone's debut and now controls three quarters of the global smartphone market[4]. Apple founder Steve Jobs stewed over what he saw as a betrayal and launched a giant, now-settled legal battle alleging Samsung and Google essentially copied the iPhone.More recently though, Apple's ire has been pointed at Facebook. Google, like Facebook, makes its money targeting its users with ads. Apple's argument: For years Apple has proudly positioned the iPhone as a more secure and more private alternative to the Android competition. As Facebook and Google have faced mounting criticism for their user tracking, Apple CEO Tim Cook has frequently joined the chorus[5]. In 2018 Cook declared that privacy was \"a fundamental human right\"[6] as he announced Apple would effectively ban Facebook's ubiquitous \"like\" button from working outside of Facebook's own pages and apps. Flashback: The animosity isn't just over philosophy and business models. In 2019, Apple shut down a Facebook \"research\" app [7]that allowed Facebook to pay users so it could track everything they did on their phones. Then Apple also temporarily cut off Facebook's own developers[8] from access to test versions of their iOS software as well.The move was widely viewed in the industry as Apple delivering a sharp rap on the knuckles to Facebook \u2014 and a public demonstration of how hard it would come down on developers who failed to take privacy seriously. Yes, but: However hot the fight gets, these two companies need each other. Just as Apple risks losing business in China if it can't offer WeChat, it would lose a lot of customers in the U.S. and elsewhere if Facebook's services \u2014 including WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 were not available for the iPhone. By the same token, many of Facebook's most valuable customers access the service via Apple devices.Our thought bubble: Each company has plenty of ammunition to attack the other as a monopolist, and that's why critics argue they should both be under closer antitrust scrutiny. Historically, the big tech companies have maintained power by dominating a key market while competing with one another at the edges. The Apple-Facebook fight shows that they're now willing to take swings at each other's core businesses.

The 2 per cent rise in Facebook shares after it was reported shows how little impact the market believes it will have on the company\u2019s finances or business model. Facebook and its rivals should nevertheless view the case as a warning shot. Beyond the FTC, the debate has shifted from fines to increasingly severe measures to keep Big Tech in check. As regulators adapt to this reality, future settlements will only become tougher.</p><p>The fine follows an investigation which began last March, triggered by the Cambridge Analytica case in which personal information was leaked to a political consultancy through a third party. The FTC found Facebook to be in breach of a previous settlement, reached after the company was discovered to be deceiving customers around their privacy practices.</p><p>Using fines to encourage better privacy protection is a questionable strategy. If they become seen as the cost of carrying on with business as usual, the FTC will be undermined.</p><p>The banking sector\u2019s treatment after the financial crisis does not give cause for hope. As with Facebook, regulators there failed to act until the damage was plain to see. Faced with overwhelming public pressure, they hurriedly applied hefty financial penalties to make up for it. Over a decade on from the global financial crisis, many of the fundamental ways in which banks operate remain worryingly unchanged. </p><p>Over the past five years the utopianism that initially prevailed around the digital economy has been supplanted by a \u201c <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwigsZfxjrzjAhUILVAKHRvuDgoQFjAAegQIAxAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fftalphaville.ft.com%2F2019%2F06%2F24%2F1561386838000%2FNick-Clegg\u2014I-m-not-just-providing-a-PR-gloss-%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw2c_Fd9j3nCoFAvhTzfgIh7\"> techlash</url>\u201d. Digital groups have transformed the way companies work and offered more choice for consumers. But the focus now is on getting tech companies to change their structure and behaviour, rather than price fines into their business models. </p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential hopeful, has proposed breaking up companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. In Germany, Facebook\u2019s attempt to pool data from across its platforms without user consent was blocked. EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager is launching a formal investigation into Amazon\u2019s data practices and how it wears two hats, as a retailer and a marketplace for rivals. </p><p>Antitrust actions would reduce the risks that combined data sets from different platforms pose to privacy. Criminal sanctions for top executives, perhaps including jail time, may ultimately be necessary to achieve genuine changes in conduct. Until now, very few have faced any meaningful penalties for their actions. While the \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d mentality may be embedded in these companies, the risk of personal consequences could act as a serious deterrent. </p><p>Even with its $5bn settlement, Facebook\u2019s commitment to changing its ways when it comes to protecting user data and privacy remains dubious. The company\u2019s promised pivot to \u201cprivacy\u201d this year was clearly in response to criticism about how it handles data. Yet experts have warned that its planned all-in-one encrypted messaging service\u2014 combining Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram \u2014 could draw on vast amounts of unsecured metadata. The way its wallet for the proposed Libra digital currency will share data is also deeply suspect.</p><p>Making big data companies more sensitive to privacy will require changing their relationship with data. Ensuring that happens needs measures and sanctions that go well beyond fines. There is no turning back.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-ea028300a88d11e9984cfac8325aaa04</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKP-4XR1-JB77-K1W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><timeReceived>9:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 18, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

Less than a week to go and the big questions are whether Boris Johnson can bear to face a grilling from BBC veteran (and the prime minister's former Spectator boss) Andrew Neil, and how the main party leaders will fare in tonight's BBC debate. We have the best of other news, including a potentially problematic exchange involving Joe Biden on the campaign trail.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                   What's going on?                   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Neil has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">thrown down the gauntlet to Johnson</url>, challenging him to a BBC interview. The prime minister has so far failed to commit - making him the only leader of a major party not to have faced the presenter during the campaign.</p><p>At the end of his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">interview with Nigel Farage</url> last night Neil turned to the camera and addressed an audience of millions about Johnson's failure to take part. \"We have been asking him for weeks now to give us a date, a time, a venue. As of now, none has been forthcoming,\" he said, adding that the prime minister's attendance at the interview was \"a question of trust\".</p><p>Last night Jeremy Corbyn gave an interview in which ITV's Julie Etchingham sought to uncover \"just who is Jeremy Corbyn?\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">Marina Hyde has some opinions</url> about how that went.

There had been calls for the men's lynching after their arrest for the alleged premeditated attack in Hyderabad. According to police, the accused were taking part in a reconstruction of the crime when they <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">tried to snatch officers' guns and were shot</url>. Police gave contradictory details concerning the events. The rape victim's family welcomed the news but the All India Progressive Women's association said it was \"counterfeit justice\" that proved police were unable to protect women and bring perpetrators to proper justice.</p><p>&gt; Joe Biden has called a heckler <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">a \"damn liar\" - and seemingly also \"fat\"</url> - during a campaign event in Iowa. The man aired discredited claims about Biden, his son Hunter and Ukraine, and challenged Biden as too old to be president. The former vice-president snapped back: \"You want to check my shape, man, let's do pushups together here, man. Let's run. Let's do whatever you want to do. Let's take an IQ test. OK?\" The suggestion was met with applause from the audience. Biden said he was actually saying \"fact\" when people thought he called the man fat. Other attendees rounded on the heckler with one telling him to \"get out of here\".</p><p>&gt; The Eddie Stobart transport business is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/05/bbcs-andrew-neil-lays-down-gauntlet-to-boris-johnson-over-interview\">on the brink of collapse</url>, with its future due to be decided at a key shareholder vote in London today that will pit William Stobart, the third son of the company's founder, against his childhood friend and former brother-in-law, Andrew Tinkler. If their competing bids fall through, the company, which employs 6,500 people, could collapse under the weight of a huge debt pile months before its 50th birthday.

Kester Aspden wrote to Mair directly a few weeks after his trial, when he was in Frankland prison.</p><p>\"Some weeks later, a letter arrived from the prison where Mair said he was being held 'IN SEGREGATION 'FOR MY OWN PROTECTION'.' He wrote in black biro, using capitals throughout. The further three pages of thoughts Mair said he had composed for me had been blocked by the censor. 'I AM AT A LOSS TO SEE HOW WE CAN HAVE A 'DIALOGUE',' Mair wrote, '... I DON'T KNOW IF EVEN THIS SHORT NOTE WILL MAKE IT PASS [sic] THE CENSOR.' The police highlighted Brexit as 'a motivating factor' for Mair and the murder of Cox soon became part of the post-vote battleground. Boris Johnson has dismissed fears about inflammatory talk as 'humbug', but the example of Jo Cox's killing has been used in a number of threatening letters sent to pro-remain - especially female - politicians.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>October 22 2019: Telenor: DNA third quarter 2019 results<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Finland, DNA, has today announced its results for the third quarter 2019.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>June 25: Telenor and Cisco Strengthen Partnership to Support Critical Infrastructure Transitions for Telcos; Scale Joint Venture WG2 for Global Operations<br/>OSLO, Norway, and SAN JOSE, Calif., June 25, 2020 - Telenor and Cisco announced today the signing of the third iteration of the Joint Purpose Agreement between the companies, outlining areas where they will strengthen focus together including security, 5G, Open vRAN, B2B expansion, distributed cloud and furthering Telenor Group's digital transformation to support its flexible way of work approach.<br/>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 24: Telenor Group divests shares in Wave Money<br/>Telenor Group will divest its 34.2% stake in Digital Money Myanmar Limited (\"Wave Money\") to Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019.

The term premium between the yield of a 7-year International Business Machines Corp. bond of 1.69% and the yield of a 2 year bond of 0.28% is  1.41%. Further, the yield curve is flattening from a term premium of 1.45% a month ago to a current level of 1.41%. This indicates investor expectations of falling inflation and/or decreasing demand for longer-term bonds. In comparison, the term premium of Treasury is 0.33%, flattening from 0.33% a month ago. </p><p>Glossary</p><p>ADVT: Average Daily Volume of shares Traded<br/>Annual Return: Dividends Paid In a 12-Month Period/Price at the Beginning of the Period + Capital Gain or Loss over 1 Year/Price 1 Year Ago (%)<br/>Capital Gain/Loss from n Years Ago to n-1 Years Ago: Capital Gain or Loss over 1 Year/Price 1 Year Ago (%)<br/>Current Ratio: Current Assets/Current Liabiliites (times)<br/>Debt/Equity: Net Debt/Net Assets %<br/>Dividend Yield: Dividend Per Share/Share Price (%)<br/>EBIT Margin : Earnings Before Interest and Tax/Revenue (%)<br/>Earnings Yield: Earnings Per Share/Share Price (%)<br/>Income during the n years (3/2/1): Dividends received during the Period<br/>Moving Average Price (n periods): Sum of Prices for each Period/Number of Periods<br/>PCP: Previous Corresponding Period<br/>PV1000: Present value of 1000 invested 1 year/'n' years ago<br/>Price/Earnings: Share Price/Earnings Per Share (times)<br/>Price/Sales: Share Price/Sales Per Share (times)<br/>Relative Price Change [RPC]: Relative price change is price change of stock with respect to Benchmark Index<br/>Relative Strength (6 Months): Price close today/Price close 6 months ago, then ranked by percentile within the entire market.<br/>Return on Assets: Net Profit/Total Assets (%)<br/>Return on Equity (Shareholders' Funds): Net Profit/Net Assets (%)<br/>TSR: Total Shareholder Returns is expressed as an annualized rate of return for shareholders after allowing for capital appreciation and dividend<br/>TTM: Trailing 12 Months<br/>Volume Index (VI): Number of shares traded in the period/Average number of shares traded for the period<br/>Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP): The Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is the summation of turnover divided by total volume in the same period.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSBUS-9920200918Usnyse789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSBUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60W0-X5C1-JB4F-Y22Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">367746</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5145\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Bites Pty Ltd.

In such a situation, providing our customers with critical services and ensuring our employees' health and safety has been our first priority. Despite the challenges, I am proud to say that during the past months, Telenor has taken a leap within digitalisation. We are now further increasing our focus on touch free operations, digital customer interactions and new ways of working.<br/>Our operating model has given us flexibility to manage operations, cost and investments, contributing to an EBITDA growth of 1 percent and free cash flow of NOK 4 billion in the quarter. As expected, lockdowns have affected prepaid markets in Asia and global roaming revenues negatively. Combined with a reduction in new sales, this led to a decline in organic subscription and traffic revenues of 4 percent, which was offset by an opex reduction of 12 percent. The financial results this quarter are positively impacted by the strong performance in our operations in Norway and Finland, while Bangladesh and Pakistan, as expected, remain the most challenged prepaid markets.<br/>Our strategy of growth, modernisation and responsible business has provided us with the ability to deliver critical services and manoeuvre in these demanding times. Going forward, we will use this experience to further enhance the execution of our modernisation journey.<br/>Outlook for 2020 For 2020, we expect a low single digit percent decline in subscription and traffic revenues, stable organic EBITDA and around 13 percent capex to sales. We will continue to focus on cost management and capex to secure resilience in cash flow.</p><p>July 15: dtac - results for the second quarter 2020<br/>Telenor Group's subsidiary in Thailand, dtac, has today reported its second quarter 2020 results.

Today, Telenor received a decision which closes ESA's proceedings. This decision relates to Telenor's prices in the segment for mobile broadband to residential customers. Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>Ref release ID 317028 dated 2012.12.04<br/>ESA made an unanounced inspection at Telenor's premises in December 2012 in order to examine whether Telenor had acted in breach of EEA competition rules. The investigation was broad and covered aspects relating to different agreements in the mobile markets. ESA's final decision relates to the margin squeeze issue only, the other aspects of the investigation were closed without any finding of infringement.<br/>The decision concerns the alleged insufficient margins between Telenor's wholesale prices and prices for mobile broadband to residential customers when sold on a stand alone basis between 2008-2012. ESA has decided to impose a fine on Telenor amounting to MEUR 111.951 (approximately BNOK 1.2).<br/>- The case concerns a small segment of the mobile market and matters which date way back. We are very surprised by the decision and the size of the fine. We will review the decision thoroughly and are preparing to appeal the decision to the EFTA Court, says managing director of Telenor Norway, Petter-Borre Furberg,<br/>The decision concerns so-called margin squeeze practices in relation to retail suppliers offering mobile broadband to residential customers. Such subscriptions were sold on a stand alone basis - they do not form part of ordinary mobile telephony subscriptions. There was very limited demand for mobile broadband as a separate product (delivered through a USB-dongle) in 2008- 2012, and the market demand has subsequently shifted to other products.</p><p>1.5 People's News<br/>Mon Aug 17, 2020<br/>Sigve Brekke was appointed CEO of Telenor (OB:TEL) five years ago on August 17, 2015.

Overall, the Group delivers an almost flat organic subscription and traffic revenue growth and organic EBITDA decline of 2%, when adjusting for project costs this quarter and non-recurring items last year. Our cost base remained stable, excluding DNA and project costs.<br/>The modernisation in Norway is progressing according to plan, and we see a 3% mobile subscription and traffic revenue growth combined with a 5% reduction in operating expenses this quarter. In Thailand and Myanmar, the momentum seen earlier in 2019 continued and both operations have now returned to positive subscription and traffic revenue growth. However, headwinds in Pakistan as a result of the telecom tax re-introduction and a difficult macroeconomic environment have made the situation locally challenging.<br/>During the quarter we have successfully concluded the acquisition of DNA in Finland. The mandatory tender offer period ended on 10 October and resulted in an ownership share of 97.96 percent. We have started to onboard DNA to our procurement processes to materialise synergies, and we are now looking for opportunities to expand service offerings to Finnish business customers.<br/>Recently, we have also taken further steps on our simplification agenda. Yesterday, we announced that we will be entering into a joint venture with Nordic Entertainment Group, combining our satellite-based entertainment businesses to extract synergies and deliver enhanced customer experience.<br/>Based on the performance so far this year and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we maintain our outlook for 2019. Execution on our strategic agenda remains our focus and key driver for value creation going forward, said Sigve Brekke, President and CEO, Telenor Group.</p><p>SECTION 13 Snapshot of 10 Norwegian

Executives have noted that travelers are waiting much longer to book than last year, a result of so much uncertainty surrounding the virus as well as work, school and child care.<br/>United's new booking tool, which uses Google's flight search engine, also allows travelers to browse flights without set dates.<br/>\"Where in the past, more people would look for flights to specific destinations on specific dates, we're seeing that today, travelers are often more open about the destinations that they would like to visit,\" United spokeswoman Christine Salamone said in an email. \"They know they'd like to get away, but they're not exactly sure where they want to go.\"<br/>United executives and those at other airlines have said they've seen relatively good demand for destinations that allow travelers to physically distance, such as those near national parks and others that offer outdoor activities.<br/>Earlier this month, United launched a map on its site that lists state travel restrictions and is considering to expanding that to international destinations, many of which remain off-limits to U.S.</p><p>September 23: Google Maps will show Covid-19 outbreaks<br/>Google on Wednesday announced a new feature in Google Maps that will show you how many Covid-19 cases there are in particular geographic regions. It pulls in information from Johns Hopkins, the New York Times, and Wikipedia and displays a color-coded map with the seven-day average of new cases per 100,000 people in a specific area. It will work in 220 countries and territories.<br/>This means you can open Google Maps to see outbreaks in your area, which could be helpful if the disease spreads more rapidly in the fall and winter. You can also use it to see if there might be an outbreak brewing in a particular area before you make holiday travel plans.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 23: Apple, Amazon and Google will emerge as winners from a major market shift, tech analyst Gene Munster predicts<br/>Long-time tech analyst Gene Munster believes big tech is on the cusp of a major shift: It's becoming a stock pickers' market.<br/>The Loup Ventures founder and managing partner expects FAANG stocks, otherwise known as Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, will fail to collectively rally like they did during most of 2020&amp;#8242;s record run.<br/>\"There's going to be a fracturing of the performance within FAANG,\" Munster told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Tuesday. \"Think of that group of haves being Apple, Amazon and Google, and the have nots being Netflix and Facebook.\"<br/>Munster sees the split coming down to adapting to the coronavirus - as well as evolving and thriving in a post-pandemic world.<br/>\"The companies that are the haves are ultimately going to be involved in much bigger businesses,\" said Munster.<br/>He's most bullish on Apple's prospects, and highlights its innovation in the health and wellness space.<br/>\"It's very simple. Cash is king, and that will ultimately will be driven even higher with wearables,\" he said.<br/>Munster speculates newer Apple watches and AirPods will be designed to attract more health-conscious consumers. He also predicts the 5G upgrade cycle will boost the bottom line.<br/>\"This company should earn close to $6 [a share] in earnings in just a couple of years,\" he noted. \"Put a 35x multiple on that, and you have a $200 stock.\"<br/>According to Munster, it's a good time to consider buying shares. Apple shares, which had a 4-1 stock split on Aug. 31, have soared 52% so far this year.

So Google is working on \"hybrid\" models, including rearranging its offices and figuring out more long-term remote work options, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview with Time magazine on Wednesday.<br/>\"I see the future as being more flexible,\" Pichai said in the interview. \"We firmly believe that in-person, being together, having a sense of community is super important when you have to solve hard problems and create something new so we don't see that changing. But we do think we need to create more flexibility and more hybrid models.\"<br/>The long-term planning comes as Google, which has been looked at as a model for Silicon Valley workplaces, slowly reveals more details of its plans to return its employees back to the office while also competing with other tech companies for top talent. Earlier in the summer, the company gave staffers the option to work from home through July 2021 amid the global pandemic. That came as Facebook announced a similar timeline, while other companies, such as Twitter, said employees can work remotely \"forever.\"<br/>Google began preparations early on in the pandemic and more recently made changes including to its internal communication forums, CNBC first reported. However, employees have missed the in-office perks such as food offerings and personal chefs.<br/>Ten percent of Google employees - down from 20% surveyed in May - said they don't want to come into the office at all in the future, according to the recent survey.</p><p>September 22: Alphabet Class A<br/>Shares of mega-cap technology companies fell broadly on Monday, continuing their spiral that started in early September.

Then, you have things like the wildfire, which - I live in California and the sky two weeks ago was this apocalyptic orange.\"<br/>Dean said despite 2020 being an \"unusual confluence of events,\" he urged students to pursue education and careers that address large problems, such as climate change, health and social justice.<br/>\"It's important to keep working to make society and the problems you care about better. It's important to solve problems that you think are important and that are going to advance all of us, collectively,\" he told students. \"Try not to focus on the negative aspects of what's happening now and focus on the few positive things you see and build on those.\"<br/>Dean, who joined Google in 1999 when it was still a start-up, is one of the few Google executives who has been regularly vocal on recent events of 2020 - particularly on Twitter, where he has criticized the Trump administration's stance on policies related to science and immigration, and acknowledged bias and lack of underrepresented workers in the tech industry.<br/>Google, alongside other tech companies like Facebook and Amazon, is facing scrutiny over its own role in society as it addresses internal diversity woes, misinformation, and anticompetitive practices - particularly as the 2020 U.S.</p><p>September 18: Alphabet chairman among tech execs endorsing Joe Biden, citing immigration policies<br/>Alphabet executive chairman John Hennessy and Google exec Vinton Cerf are part of two dozen Turing Award winners - known as the Nobel Prize of computing - to sign a letter in support of Democratic nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris, citing immigration concerns.<br/>The group also includes distinguished Google engineer David Patterson, Pixar co-founder Ed Catmull, Facebook's chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun and Microsoft research scientists Leslie Lamport and Butler Lampson. The endorsements reflect the opinions of the people who signed the letter, not the companies they work for.<br/>The support comes as technology leaders fear U.S. tech talent will be significantly impacted if further restrictions are placed on work visas under President Donald Trump.<br/>\"The most brilliant people in the world want to come here and be grad students, but now they are being discouraged from coming here, and many are going elsewhere,\" Patterson told The New York Times. \"We have to step out of our comfort zone and make a statement,\" he added.<br/>\"Information technology is thoroughly globalized,\" the endorsement letter says. \"Academic computer science departments attract talented students, many of whom immigrate and become American inventors and captains of industry.\"<br/>\"Joe Biden and Kamala Harris listen to experts before setting public policy, essential when science and technology may help with many problems facing our nation today,\" the letter continued.<br/>An Alphabet spokesperson was not immediately available to comment.<br/>Google leaders were once some of the most vocal execs on immigration policies, even hosting protests. But they've tempered their opinions on public policies and have tried to increase partnerships with the U.S. government through lucrative contracts. Google is under increased regulatory and political scrutiny and is expected to face an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S.</p><p>September 15: These stocks could benefit most from possible antitrust action against Google<br/>Google competitors have long wished for the day U.S. regulators would sue the tech giant on antitrust grounds. That day could reportedly come as soon as this month, according to The New York Times, which recently said that Attorney General William Barr is pushing the Antitrust Division to file a case against Google by the end of September.<br/>A lawsuit would begin what would surely become a landmark antitrust case, though its conclusion could still be years away. But an outcome that leads to an enforcement action against Google could mark an opportunity for several other companies that compete with the tech giant.<br/>If Google sees antitrust action in the U.S., it's most likely to fall within one or more of three distinct areas of its business: search, digital advertising or its Android mobile operating system.

Augmented reality allows devices, such as phones and tablets, to overlay digital content on top of the real world that a user can see while looking at the screen.<br/>Jain hopes Google can provide exclusive video replays to fans and other supplementary experiences. \"These are all things that come together in that future reinvention or re-imagination of the fan experience,\" he said.<br/>The $5 billion complex, developed by Rams owner Stan Kroenke, is set to open Sunday when the team hosts the Dallas Cowboys.<br/>\"We couldn't have picked a better partner to manage our technology needs,\" Skarpi Hedinsson, chief technology officer, SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park, said in a statement.</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>Source: Bloomberg<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"552\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Aug 27</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">U.S. Antitrust Case Against Google Zeroes In On 'Tying' Products</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 Corporate Profile and Independent Ratings<br/>2.1 Activities<br/>Alphabet Inc maintains an index of Websites and other online content, and makes this information freely available through its search engine to anyone with an Internet connection.

Both technologies have been stonewalled by concerned regulators and lawmakers around the globe and neither has launched.<br/>Beller's departure from Facebook puts the future of libra and Novi further in doubt, though she told CNBC she'll remain an advisor for both products to help make sure they come to market.<br/>\"I love libra, I'm a fan girl of libra,\" Beller said. \"I'm not going away. I'll continue to be a friend, follow very closely and be involved at some capacity. It was just that when the NFX folks came knocking - this was obvious.\"<br/>Beller said she will continue to keep an interest in blockchain technology at NFX, but that she's open to investing in a variety of technologies.<br/>\"The crazy, weird, creative folks who are contrarians and see the world as broken or see the world differently than other people, those are the people I want to speak to,\" she said.<br/>Since its founding in 2015, NFX has kept its focus on companies that have the potential for network effects, meaning their value and capabilities increase as more and more users join.</p><p>September 22: There is really just one stock that would benefit most from antitrust action against Facebook<br/>Over the past year, Facebook has shouldered the prospect of antitrust action as a former co-founder, presidential candidates and congress members have all called for the company to be broken up. The start to that process could come as soon as this year. The Wall Street Journal this month reported the Federal Trade Commission is now gearing up to possibly file an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook before the end of 2020.<br/>An antitrust lawsuit against Facebook would kick off a years-long process. And it is unclear just what consequences the tech company would face.<br/>Among the possibilities are the divestment of Instagram, WhatsApp or both. The company could also face restrictions about what data it collects or how that data can be used to target ads to users.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 22: Facebook<br/>Shares of mega-cap technology companies fell broadly on Monday, continuing their spiral that started in early September. Microsoft and Apple lost 1% and Amazon fell nearly 2%.

This large userbase means Facebook has a large effect on our society and our democracy. That was made evident in the 2016 presidential election.<br/>Since 2017, Facebook has removed over 100 networks that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior, like the fake Russian news organization Peace Data. Facebook says it now works with 70 different third-party fact-checking partners and has greatly increased its ad transparency.<br/>But the threats of 2020 will be much different than 2016.

In many ways, they're sounding the alarm on their own creations. One former Facebook executive, Tim Kendall, who was asked what worried him most, said: \"In the shortest time horizon, I'm most worried about civil war.\"<br/>Somewhat ironically, social media is awash with people saying they plan to delete their social media accounts after watching the show, with Facebook and Instagram appearing to be called out most frequently.<br/>\"Everyone should watch The Social Dilemma documentary on Netflix and then make the necessary changes,\" one Twitter user wrote. \"Tonight I deleted Facebook and turned off notifications from Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn. It's time to take back control of our minds.\"<br/>Another Twitter user said: \"Just watched this and immediately deleted #Facebook and #Instagram. A must watch to understand the manipulation.\"<br/>Ranked as the 5th most watched show on Netflix in the U.K. on Friday and hailed as \"the most important documentary of our times\" by The Independent newspaper, \"The Social Dilemma\" shines a light on how tech companies influence national elections, \"follow\" billions of people around the internet in order to deliver targeted ads to them and come up with features that drive addiction.<br/>Facebook, which also owns Instagram, declined to comment when asked whether it was concerned about a potential user backlash.<br/>Instead the California-headquartered firm pointed to several announcements and resources on safety and mental health.</p><p>September 17: Facebook issues new rules on internal employee communication<br/>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday outlined to employees a new set of principles to guide debates and conversations within Workplace, the company's internal social network.<br/>Zuckerberg outlined the changes to address \"a lot of very tense conversations happening out in the world,\" according to company spokesman Joe Osborne. The new principles follow a set of similar changes at Google, which is increasing the moderation of its internal message boards, CNBC reported earlier this week.<br/>\"We deeply value expression and open discussion. What we've heard from our employees is that they want the option to join debates on social and political issues rather than see them unexpectedly in their work feed,\" Osborne said in a statement. \"We're updating our employee policies and work tools to ensure our culture remains respectful and inclusive.\"<br/>The changes follow a set of recent leaks from Workplace and the company's weekly Q&amp;As showing that employees have increased their criticism of the company's policies.<br/>Under the new set of principles, Zuckerberg said, Facebook will ensure all employees feel supported at work, especially the company's Black community, by strengthening the company's harassment policy with more protections for underrepresented employees.<br/>The company will also be more specific about which parts of Workplace can be used to discuss social and political issues. This change will be so that employees do not have to confront social issues during their day-to-day work.<br/>Facebook's new principles also ask that employees communicate with professionalism and continue to debate about the company's work but do so in a respectful manner.<br/>BuzzFeed last month reported employees criticized Zuckerberg's explanation of why the company failed to remove a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to plan an event where two protesters were shot and killed.</p><p>September 17: As Main Street crisis worsens, Facebook launches new small business platform<br/>Facebook is increasing its focus on the small business community, launching a new interface called \"Business Suite\" on Thursday which is targeted at small businesses that have struggled throughout the Covid-19 pandemic.<br/>The platform is available exclusively to small businesses at launch, according to a release from the social media and advertising giant, but it will expand offerings to larger businesses next year.<br/>\"This is a long-term investment to make this the main interface for businesses of all sizes who use Facebook, Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp,\" said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg in a statement announcing the new platform.<br/>The focus on the small business community comes as Facebook has faced a number of challenges. On Tuesday, a group of celebrities including Kim Kardashian West, Katy Perry, Michael B. Jordan and Ashton Kutcher, participated in a 24-hour Instagram \"freeze\" as part of the Stop Hate For Profit movement to protest what the organization calls \"Facebook's repeated failures to address hate speech and election disinformation on their platforms.\"<br/>During the summer, many prominent corporate brands took a break from Facebook ads to highlight their concerns over the same issues.<br/>Facebook CFO David Wehner noted in its Q2 earnings discussion that the top 100 advertisers represented 16% of Facebook ad revenue, which was a lower percentage than a year ago.<br/>This year, the company has deployed information centers as a tactic to combat the spread of misinformation on Facebook and Instagram. The company launched a Covid hub in March, and in August, Facebook rolled out a voter information center.<br/>Facebook also is among the big tech firms under pressure from the federal government and facing potential antitrust action.<br/>At a virtual CNBC event last month, Sandberg said the social media company needs to work with whoever wins the 2020 U.S.</p><p>September 17: Facebook is cracking down on groups that give health advice and promote violence<br/>Facebook on Thursday announced new policies that will limit the spread of groups on its social network that focus on giving users health advice, as well as groups with ties to violence.<br/>The company will no longer show health groups in its recommendations, saying a blog post that \"it's crucial that people get their health information from authoritative sources.\" In the past, closed groups have been used by Facebook users to spread misinformation about vaccines and Covid-19.<br/>Similarly, the company said it will limit the spread of groups tied to violence by removing them from recommendations, restricting them from search and reducing how often their content shows up on people's News Feeds. This move comes as Facebook has struggled to moderate groups, including a militia group in Kenosha, Wisconsin, that used Facebook to organize an event where two people were killed in real life.<br/>Facebook said it removed the pages tied to that event after it happened, blaming an \"operational error\" for allowing the event to stay up despite the fact it violated the company's policies. But BuzzFeed later discovered that Facebook did not remove the pages; one of the group's admins did. It was only then that Facebook admitted it never took the event down.<br/>Additionally, Facebook will now archive groups that do not have admins, which are key to moderating groups. If an admin steps down from their role, they can invite other groups members to replace them. Facebook will also suggest this role to active members, but if no one steps up, the company will archive those groups. If Facebook removes a group for policy reasons, administrators and moderators of that group will be unable to create any new groups for a period of time.<br/>Facebook also said that it will prevent the admins and moderators of any groups that it removes for policy violations from creating any new groups \"for a period of time,\" although the company did not specify how long that window lasts.</p><p>September 16: Facebook's latest virtual reality headset is the best yet, but still feels antisocial<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced the Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset. It's a successor to last year's Quest and, like that version, doesn't require a computer to run. Everything you need to use VR is bundled inside.<br/>This is the strategy Facebook is taking moving forward. It's ditching the Oculus Rift headset, which required a PC to operate.<br/>You can still run advanced PC virtual reality games designed for the Rift on the Quest 2 using an Oculus Link USB-C cable. Oculus Link was in beta on the original Oculus Quest, but now it's an official feature. This is Facebook's long-term vision: a headset you can use anywhere you want, but that you can still link to a PC to render games that require more powerful hardware.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>September 16: Facebook teaming up with Ray-Ban maker for first smart glasses in 2021<br/>Facebook on Wednesday announced a partnership with Luxottica, the maker of Ray-Ban, to release its first pair of smart glasses in 2021.<br/>\"After spending time with their team and visiting their factory, I knew that they were the right partner for us to help bring the best technology together with the best glasses,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a live stream from Facebook Connect, the company's online event for its virtual and augmented reality products.<br/>Facebook and Luxottica will make the glasses as part of a multiyear partnership. The pairing of the two companies was first reported by CNBC last year.<br/>\"I can't go into full product details yet, but they're really the next step on the road to augmented reality glasses,\" Zuckerberg said. \"And they look pretty good too.\"<br/>Zuckerberg also announced that the company plans to release Project Aria, a research device that the company will use to learn as it develops its consumer smart glasses.<br/>Source: CNBC</p><p>1.6 Stock Buzz</p><p>Source: The Wall Street Journal<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"544\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Google, Twitter and Facebook CEOs Threatened With Subpoena</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 16</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FTC Preparing Possible Antitrust Suit Against Facebook</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Buys REI s New Headquarters as Pandemic Prompts Sale</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 11</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Appeals Move to Curb EU-U.S. Data Transfer</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 09</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Ireland to Order Facebook to Stop Sending User Data to U.S.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 05</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook s Rittenhouse Mistake</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Bloomberg<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"552\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 27</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Sues EU Over 'Irrelevant' Demands in Antitrust Probes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 13</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Investment Helps Asia's Richest Man Shed Oil Dependence</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 06</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Helps Explain Why ESG Investing Matters</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jul 03</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative Under Siege After Facebook Scrutiny</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Jun 29</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Facebook Can't Eliminate All Hate Speech, VP Nick Clegg Says</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Source: Other Publishers<br/><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">News Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Headline</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Publisher</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 25, 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Q3 2020 EPS Estimates for Facebook, Inc.

See also our related columns The Turning Point,Techie Tuesdays, and Storybites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Transformations in the worlds of money and technology are converging, as described in the book by Sanjay Phadke, Fintech Future: The Digital DNA of Finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The material is spread across 17 chapters, and makes for an informative read for beginners new to this field. However, the choice of font could do with considerable improvement, and there are several typos; more figures would have been a welcome addition to improve readability as well.</p><p>Sanjay Phadke is the Head of Global Platforms and Alliances at Vayana Network. He describes himself as a \"tinkerer (almost) and teacher (hopefully)\". He graduated from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies and Sardar Patel College Of Engineering.</p><p>Here are my takeaways from the 190-page book, summarised as well in Table 1. See also my reviews of the related books Prediction Machines; Seeing Digital; A Human's Guide to Machine Intelligence; Machine, Platform, Crowd; and The AI Advantage.</p><h>Evolution of money</h><p>The invention of language and money are key contributions to the evolution of society, Sanjay begins. Money acts as a bridge from past to present and future. It is a form of payment and trust, and even a way to acquire more money through financial investment.</p><p>Money is a means of exchange and way of comparing the worth of different assets and services. It has deterministic, probabilistic, and even emotional connotations. Evolving from shells to coins and banknotes, currency and its governance are being transformed in the digital era.</p><p>While coins did not need numbering, banknotes do. Banknotes today account for only five percent of monies globally, Sanjay explains; the rest is stored in digital or 'dematerialised' form.</p><p>\"Digital money is data,\" the author observes, it is a string of characters, and does not derive trust from its physical form any more. New risks arise, of course. \"No digital property can be guaranteed to be foolproof from digital theft,\" he cautions.</p><h>Key players</h><p>Banks, big tech giants, and fintech startups are the three categories of players in today's financial scenario, Sanjay explains. The industry is tightly regulated, so governments and exchanges play a key role as well.</p><p>There are significant differences in the mindset and operations of banks and tech-led firms. Tech DNA is about rapid change, agile development, and learning quickly from mistakes to develop easy-to-use offerings. Bank DNA is about being cautious, paranoid, careful in experimentation, and slow change.</p><p>One chapter traces the evolution of the \"finscape\" in the US, China, and India. The US already had a mature system in place in the pre-digital era, with social security numbers, credit cards, and credit bureaus. \"China and India, in contrast, had vastly underdeveloped ecosystems,\" Sanjay observes.</p><p>The US tech players have now set high expectations for engagement among the younger generation of mobile-connected always-on users around the world. \"Silicon Valley is coming,\" in the words of Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan.</p><p>The market value of US tech giants like Apple and Amazon is around half of India's GDP, and they are entering the world of finance along with Google and Facebook as well, Sanjay explains.</p><h>Fintech 1.0</h><p>Mobile payments and digital-only banks are some forms of Fintech 1.0, Sanjay explains. Alibaba's Ant Financial set up MyBank as a digital-only bank to offer loans to small businesses in just minutes. It draws on transactional and social media data, fed into AI scoring models.</p><p>Neo-banks do not have a banking license but partner with banks to offer banking services. Some existing banks have also rolled out their own digital-only banks, such as Fidor by JPMorgan Chase and Kotak's 811.</p><p>Payment via QR codes has accelerated mobile payments even more. IoT and the emergence of 5G will speed up the momentum further. IoT sensors in vehicles are being used by automobile insurance firms; voice-based assistants and face-recognition technologies are other trends to watch in fintech.</p><p>Paypal was one of the first \"native-Internet\" fintechs. Microsoft is more likely to be a collaborator with banks than a competitor. Softbank is another player to watch, thanks to its investments in fintech startups, the author writes. Fintechs in other countries include Adyen (Netherlands) and Klarna (Sweden).</p><p>China has a highly-innovative landscape at scale, as seen in Alibaba's Alipay, Yue Bao (money-market fund), and Sesame Credit (social credit rating). Ant Financial is the first of the \"super fintechs,\" according to Sanjay. (See also my reviews of the related books Tech Titans of China,China's Mobile Economy, and AliBaba.)</p><p>There are new active players in wealth management, consumer loans and insurance. Alibaba also expanded into finance for logistics services, a move copied by other players around the world. Thanks to not having legacy baggage, China has created a \"futuristic fintech ecosystem,\" Sanjay explains. However, it is siloed into the BAT trio worlds.</p><p>India has emerged as a laboratory for global big-tech players, along with local firms like HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance. Among startups, the book focuses largely on Paytm and not the broader spectrum of players. Paytm's fortunes were boosted by events like demonetisation, and also received India's first investment by Warren Buffet.</p><h>Fintech 2.0</h><p>The world is awash with money, yet few get loans, the author laments. Cautious banks need collaterals, guarantors, or credit history data based on past records. Unfortunately, the aspirational needs of low-income or poor people cannot be fulfilled in such a system, even though India has 120,000 bank branches - the highest number in the world.</p><p>\"The poor pay the highest for a loan and gets next to nothing on deposits,\" Sanjay observes. Even remittances of foreign labourers are charged relatively high service fees.</p><p>Frauds and false identities have plagued the banking system. Digital transformation can help in this regard, but there are also risks regarding theft of data, money and reputation, the author cautions.</p><p>India's larger fintech moves have been cautious and led largely by the government, as seen by inter-connected developments in the B2C and B2B sectors like biometric UID, UPI (Unified Payment Interface), and GST. The author identifies other developments as well, such as DEPA (Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture), PCR (Public Credit Registry), and AA (Account Aggregator).</p><p>Aadhaar helped Jio acquire a million customers a day, and reduced activation times. Jio is forging alliances with a range of tech giants, Sanjay observes. Digital technology and finance innovations helped spur the Chinese economy and created a vast pool of SMEs; it is hoped that a similar boom can take place in India as well.</p><p>The API architecture is spurring a range of innovations on top of existing digital infrastructure, driven by the talent of entrepreneurs. Hopefully, these combined developments can make access to capital easier and more automated, given the rapid growth of data communications in India.</p><p>The success of emerging economies like India depends on democratising access to capital as raw material for the needy, the author emphasises.</p><h>Fintech 3.0</h><p>The author charts a range of technologies in the next wave of fintech, clustered as the new ABC: AI, algorithms, autonomous operation; big data, blockchain, bitcoin; and cloud, crypto, cybersecurity. Other trends to watch are quantum computing, which can also pose risks to security via the ability to crack codes.</p><p>Continuous feeds of data and powerful algorithms can improve automation and robustness of financial processes at scale. For example, they can improve assessment of ability and willingness to pay by better understanding social psychology (though overcoming bias will be a challenge). Spotting anomalies and outliers can improve fraud detection defences.</p><p>Bitcoin regulations vary around the world, but some blockchain features are being implemented. Hybrid systems may emerge in such a context, the author observes.</p><p>Platformisation combined with AI is a powerful combination. But countries have adopted varying positions on cloud infrastructure and data sovereignty as well (eg.

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt   plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p>The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016   as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S.   22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City   not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p>Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p>Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco   and its environs   a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p>Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p>To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p>Follow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt   plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p>The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016   as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S.   22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City   not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p>Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p>Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco   and its environs   a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p>Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p>To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p>Follow Froma Harrop on Twitter @FromaHarrop.

The most cited reason was the successful campaign by open-Internet activists working alongside heavy broadband users, notably Netflix, Twitter and Mozilla, proprietor of the Firefox browser.</p><p> But there\u2019s another reason. A lot of ordinary Americans hate their cable company. They fume with every month\u2019s astronomically high TV-Internet-phone bundle bill, the product of the company\u2019s monopoly or near-monopoly power.</p><p> High-speed Internet is seen no longer as a luxury but as the staff of commercial and personal life. Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p> Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names \u2014 Google, Facebook, Microsoft \u2014 didn\u2019t fight against the net neutrality decision \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\u201d</p><p> (Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.)</p><p> In the real world, these big content providers have been for \u2014 not against \u2014 net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \u201ca grave threat to the Internet.\u201d Did they make themselves clear?</p><p> As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn\u2019t rush into the fray. She told Wired they \u201crisked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\u201d</p><p> Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don\u2019t seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn\u2019t be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p> Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies\u2019 investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p> \u201cThey wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\u201d Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That\u2019s because Google\u2019s business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \u201cdid not have any specific impact on (Google\u2019s) plans to build more Fiber cities.\u201d</p><p> All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What\u2019s left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations. That bowl never empties.</p><p> Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:fharrop@gmail.com\">fharrop@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Froma Harrop</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKVA-a9c126e9578f8ac81b9bf7afce9caf83f7404a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28992B331E5C3B NWBKVA2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FFB-P2R1-JD6S-R1NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Northern Virginia Daily<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

It's one of many technology giants, including Amazon.com and Alphabet's Google, demanding cheaper - and cleaner - electricity as their data demands grow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This hunger for power has set Silicon Valley on a collision course with the Trump administration, which is working up a plan to keep coal plants afloat by raising electricity prices. As a rare source of demand growth, these tech firms have become formidable advocates for clean energy. They've contracted enough renewable energy to displace at least 12 coal generators, and some are paying millions to sever ties with utilities to find their own supply.</p><p>Big Tech is no longer \"afraid to throw around their weight or their ability to influence - some might say bully - their local utility or local governments in what they want to get, said Lucas Beran, a senior research analyst on IHS Markit's data center and cloud team.</p><p>It's easy to see why the companies have become such advocates. Power used by all the nation's data centers is set to climb 4 percent from 2014 to 2020, according to an Energy Department report. Server farms now draw enough electricity to light up Las Vegas and the rest of Nevada, twice over. Etsy alone used 10,679 megawatt-hours last year - enough to supply 1,000 homes.</p><p>While coal still accounts for about a third of U.S. electricity, it's losing ground to cheaper natural gas, wind and solar. Hundreds of mines have shut down in recent years, and President Donald Trump campaigned on a pledge to revive them. His administration is now calling on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to enact a plan that would subsidize coal-fired power plants.</p><p>In a letter last month, Etsy called on regulators to reject Trump's plan, which it described as a barrier to \"making creative entrepreneurship a path to economic security. Separately, a group that includes Amazon and Microsoft Corp. said the administration is overlooking the potential of renewable power, grid technology and energy storage, warning that the proposal would create \"burdensome out-of-market costs on consumers like our companies.</p><p>Their push for clean power extends well beyond Washington. Alphabet has called on utilities to create \"buy-as-you-go renewable energy programs. The demands of modern electricity consumers have outgrown the standard utility business model designed \"for a bygone era, it said in a white paper last year. The Mountain View, California-based company, which runs the world's largest online search engine, has signed contracts to buy 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy that it said will lead to $3.5 billion of investments.</p><p>The fight to transform power supplies is just the latest instance of technology companies flexing their political muscle and green image. Earlier this year, the industry opposed Trump's decision to remove the U.S. from the international Paris climate accord. Many including Google, Microsoft and Facebook pledged to continue the battle against global warming.</p><p>Meanwhile, building solar and wind farms is now less expensive than keeping coal generators online in parts of the U.S., and solar power is set to become the world's cheapest source of electricity. Renewables account for about 15 percent of the U.S. power mix, compared with almost nothing two decades ago.</p><p>Utilities aren't opposed to investing in renewable power. But technology companies are demanding supplies in quantities that could disrupt the reliability of transmission systems, said Matt Mooren, an energy analyst with PA Consulting Group.</p><p>Electricity is notoriously hard to store, so for the most part, it must be used instantaneously. Solar and wind farms don't work when the sun isn't shining and wind isn't blowing.</p><p>That creates a juggling act for utilities that must maintain a steady flow of power to customers. Industry consultant Lazard estimates a grid can handle about 30 percent of its power coming from renewables. Beyond that, utilities need backup systems like batteries or conventional power plants.</p><p>Even so, the technology industry won't let up on its demands, said Mark Mills, a senior fellow at the free-market think tank Manhattan Institute who authored the 2013 study \"The Cloud Begins With Coal. Improvements in the efficiency of servers have slowed just as demand for data has taken off, he said. Information stored in data centers globally will quintuple by 2020, according to Cisco Systems.</p><p>Switch Inc., a Las Vegas data-center provider agreed to pay $27 million last year to leave its Nevada utility in a bet that the company could find cheaper renewable energy elsewhere. Microsoft paid almost $24 million to bypass a Washington utility and find power on its own.</p><p>In September, a group of tech firms including Adobe Systems pressed Dominion Energy for more renewables in Virginia - a hot spot for data centers - noting that the companies represent the utility's biggest source of future demand growth. Less than a month later, Dominion agreed to add clean power for a new Facebook data center, paving a potential path for others.</p><p>The pressure on utilities to source more renewables is only going to increase as large companies strike deals like this, said John Powers, who works for a Schneider Electric unit providing clean energy products to businesses. The company pointed to one group as proof: The Employers for Renewable Energy describes itself as a coalition advocating for companies to move to states that don't \"stifle their desire for clean energy.</p><p>Tech companies have a lot of leverage now over state governments and utilities that are \"drooling over the power use from data centers as demand from other industries flat-line, said Gary Cook, a senior analyst at Greenpeace who specializes in information technology.</p><p>And they're not waiting on government to effect change.</p><p>In West Virginia - the heart of America's Coal Country - potter Joy Bridy makes everything from mugs to sauerkraut crocks that she sells on Etsy. Her operation is powered by solar panels that Etsy helped her get.</p><p>Despite her state's deep roots in coal, she backs the company's fight for more renewable energy.</p><p>\"That's the way the ball's rolling, Bridy said. \"The sooner we all get with the program, the better it will be.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2017335574</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R3K-76K1-DYT8-R2MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1075\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 1, 2017, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC000A63L</classCode><className>ETSY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ETSY (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

BROADBAND 2017 will see a year of very slow broadband progress for those living outside cities or big towns. While Eir and Siro (the joint venture between Vodafone and ESB) will continue to roll out fibre broadband in the country's largest towns, very little will change for more than one million people living in rural parts of the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Government has admitted that the rollout of the State's National Broadband Plan, which promises high-speed connections to all rural homes regardless of where they are situated, will be delayed again until 2018. (It says it has to get the contracts right before it can build it out.) That means that up to half of those in rural areas will see little improvement until 2020. The cost in opportunity foregone, investment pitches lost and emigration could be huge.</p><p>2. IPHONE 8 SUPER-CYCLE It's a fair bet that this will be the biggest tech hardware story of 2017. Sure, the latest iPhone is always big news. But next year is the 10th anniversary of its launch. Already, industry analysts are feverishly talking about a 'super cycle' that will see the biggest ever upgrade to an iPhone. The new model is already tipped to have a curved glass shape with no bezel, no physical button and an ability for 'long range' wireless charging.</p><p>While curved glass models are already around (see Samsung's S7 Edge), Apple is also likely to load the new phone with even better cameras and more storage memory, further bedding it down as your main everyday computer and communicator. Then again, it could be something completely different.</p><p>3. THE SEEDS OF 5G It may seem ironic to those struggling to get a decent 3G (yet alone 4G) mobile signal in some parts of Ireland, but 2017 will be the year when Ireland's main operators start seriously planning for the introduction of the next milestone in mobile connectivity - 5G. By definition, that potentially opens the way for big steps in other parts of our lives.</p><p>Self-driving cars, for example, may need very reliable, fast bandwidth to operate safely and effectively on city streets. The same is true for a raft of 'smart city' initiatives which depend on constant communication over the airwaves between devices operating on their own without human intervention.</p><p>For punters, it will mean getting fibre-grade speeds on your phone and portable computing devices. Where 4G currently maxes out at around 60Mbs in real-world situations here, 5G will easily exceed 100Mbs.</p><p>IF I MAKE ONE HAPPEN...I'd fast-track the Plan and start connections to every country. If more money provide it: an additional (EURO)or (EURO)1bn is worth non-urban chance to survive as cities.</p><p>4. MOBILE PAYMENTS ARE COMING Ever wish you could pay for your daily basics in a shop or cafe with your phone? By the end of 2017, you will be able to do just this. In the last weeks of 2016, Google launched Android Pay, which allows you to 'save' a credit or debit card (AIB and KBC only, with more bank cards to come) into your Android (Samsung, Sony, Huawei and more) phone and then swipe or tap your phone against a contactless terminal anytime you want to pay for items under (EURO)30.</p><p>Sometime in 2017, Apple may well follow suit in Ireland with its own Apple Pay system, which operates in a similar way for iPhone owners. Not to be outdone, Samsung may also launch Samsung Pay here, too: it has said it will launch the payment system in the UK early next year.</p><p>5. FAKE NEWS ON SOCIAL MEDIA In late 2016, social media was blamed for helping to tip Donald Trump into the White House through the unchecked proliferation of so-called 'fake news'.</p><p>It already looks like this is going to be a huge issue in 2017, although perhaps equally played out as a proxy issue as much as a real one. Between them, Facebook and Google now take some three quarters of the online display ad revenue in the US, and over half in the UK. That is leading to significant resentment among big media publishers (and quite a few journalists) who bristle at this market dynamic. And this is not unrelated to the slew of commentary pieces, news stories and high-handed editorials suggesting that some sort of intervention should be on hand to bring social networks into a regulatory framework 'just like we have to deal with'.</p><p>COULD THING National Broadband building fibre internet Oddly, the focus is more on Facebook than Google, even though the latter takes far more ad revenue. Google, you see, had been around long enough to be regarded as an essential utility. So it gets a bye.</p><p>rural home in the were needed, I'd (EURO)300m, (EURO)500m it to give Ireland's regions the same learn, trade and IRELAND's the for of Facebook, though, has only really started to rake it in over the last three years. And this has been at a particularly sensitive time for publishers, who face downsizing and existential uncertainty that are directly linked to a loss of ad income (\"to Facebook\"). In this vein, expect Facebook to face more and more media hostility and institutional calls for its wings to be clipped via regulation.</p><p>(6. ROBOTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE There's no getting away from more robots and smarter machines entering our lives or in chipping away at our jobs. This month, the first self-driving Uber cars began to pick up passengers in the US. Amazon has released a new video showing delivery by drone, this time in the UK. Microsoft is rolling out artificial intelligence that lets online bots call you via Skype on behalf of regular companies.</p><p>But while robot vacuum cleaners, smart homes and even clothes-folding machines may make life easier for us, the mechanised devices are coming for our jobs, too. Both Amazon and Apple's biggest factory partner, Foxconn, are replacing thousands of human employees with robots. Call-centre operators are switching human agents for computer ones. And fast-food restaurant owners are now starting to talk along similar lines. McDonalds already has self-ordering terminals in Irish outlets while US chain Carl's Jr is considering replacing burger-flipping staff with robots.) 2017 may be the year where we see roboticisation and artificial intelligence start to encroach on jobs in accountancy, finance, marketing and other whitecollar activities.</p><p>7. VIRTUAL REALITY: STILL THE NEXT BIG THING 2016 was supposed to be the big breakthrough year for virtual reality in our lives. It wasn't quite that, but it certainly made some significant strides. While PC-based variants such as Oculus and HTC are still seeing slow sales growth, Sony's launch of its Playstation VR (an addon for its Playstation 4 games system) may have given the tethered ecosystem its first significant mass-market boost.</p><p>Samsung's mobile Gear VR headset has sold pretty well, too, while Google and Facebook have both dedicated a lot of attention to it through new headsets and services (such as Google Daydream and 360 video on Facebook).</p><p>Some broadcasters and publishers are starting to film a few things in VR-friendly 360 degrees, too. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal have some interesting 360 content on their mobile apps, while Sky has announced its intention to bring a lot more sport and documentary content to a VR platform.</p><p>8. APPLE IN IRELAND: A TURNING POINT? To say that 2016 was a challenging one for Apple's presence in Ireland is an understatement. Just two weeks ago, the European Commission confirmed a (EURO)13bn fine, claiming that Ireland has given unfair and selective state aid to the company through tax policy here. Apple and Ireland are both vigorously challenging the Commission ruling. But if Brussels wins the day, will Apple's presence in Cork - where it employs 6,000 people - be jeopardised? The election of Donald Trump as US president also has a bearing here: his administration looks likely to issue a repatriation tax amnesty for companies such as Apple which have been earning and keeping billions of dollars abroad. Trump has also made it clear that US policy might more aggressively persuade companies to base more operations in America than abroad.</p><p>Apple chief executive Tim Cook has repeatedly said that Apple will stick with Cork no matter what. But a year is a long time in international business.</p><p>9. A WITHERING LAPTOP MARKET The influence of laptops in our lives will fall even further in 2017. Over the last five years, sales of PCs have fallen around 20pc. And new figures from Statcounter show that PC and laptop internet traffic has fallen below 50pc globally for the first time. The reason is simple: we don't use them for much outside work projects anymore.</p><p>Last month's MacBook Pro launch by Apple is a case in point. It should have been one of the biggest tech events of the year. Instead, it only piqued interest. We still use laptops for work, and if we're into design, gaming or other niche pursuits, we take an active interest in them. But for the rest, a laptop is increasingly just a bare utility to get something done during office hours.</p><p>Five years ago, my desk was regularly flooded with requests for advice on laptops, both by colleagues and readers. Which model was best for travelling? Which was best for students? Was Windows or Mac the best long-term option? Then, virtually all of the interest dried up. I have barely had one query about a laptop - from anyone - in the last 18 months. Instead, I get weekly queries about phones. Is upgrading to the iPhone 7 the best strategy now? What's the best Samsung to get? Are alternative models such as the One Plus 3 a savvier choice? It's a phone's world now; laptops are becoming the servers we only fall back on when we need to.</p><p>10. THE RESURRECTION OF iPADS For the last three years, sales of tablets have fallen because five-inch phones have usurped their role as web-browsers, video screens and social-media devices in the eyes of many consumers.</p><p>That leaves tablets and iPads in something of a no-man's land: they're unnecessary for Facebook, but aren't quite built to handle traditional office work flows.</p><p>But changing demographics, together with the continuing demise of laptops, are set to give tablets a reprieve. For most people, smartphone interfaces are now the most familiar computing system they know.</p><p>Increasingly, it is Windows and Mac OS interfaces that look complicated compared to the 'ordinary' smartphone systems.</p><p>This is particularly true for those under 25, a growing number of whom have never spent much time with older Windows or Mac PC systems. But they still need big screens to get projects and light work done.</p><p>Some manufacturers are starting to bet on this trend. Lenovo, which vies with Dell and HP at the top of the PC-manufacturing heap, recently launched its Yoga Book. This is a moderately priced tabletand-keyboard combo that adds in extra productivity features. It's aimed mainly at students and younger people, who aren't as brainwashed into thinking that PCs are 'real' computers while phones are 'add-ons'.</p><p>In Ireland, tens of thousands of kids now use iPads at school and have never operated a PC or a Mac. For them, switching on a laptop is an unintuitive chore.</p><p>So while middle-aged laptopbuyers (those over 35) still can't fully contemplate a tablet as a full-time laptop replacement, young adults increasingly have little problem with the notion.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Taxing times: A protester dressed as Snow White demonstrates outside the parliament buildings in Dublin in support of the EU ruling to take (EURO)13bn in taxes from Apple last September;

Yet, in recent years, the middle has become less stable, less predictable, and more elusive, and its primacy -- in economics, politics, business, asset management and even sports -- has become increasingly unsustainable.</p><p> Driven by structural changes, as well as lagging business and policy responses, the middle has been eroded, or is at risk, almost everywhere you look. Should this trend continue, which is subject to some debate, the implications would be far-reaching.</p><p> For decades, a rising median household income in advanced economies anchored the growth of a middle class that often opted for the political centre. Together with stable and trusted institutions, the middle class acted as a stabiliser for a more prosperous society.</p><p> In business, too, an environment in which mid-size firms flourished was viewed as desirable, because it reconciled small firms' lack of balance-sheet strength with their larger counterparts' tendency to slip into oligopolistic complacency. But median incomes have stagnated, which, combined with the impact of technology and insufficient policy attention to the potential distributional effects of unfettered globalisation, has gradually hollowed out the middle class around the world.</p><p> As a result, both the hope and reality of a satisfying middle-class life, with its potential for upward social mobility, are in decline. In addition to weakening an important social stabilising force, the diminution of the middle class has fuelled the politics of anger and undermined the political centre, hitherto dominated by established parties.</p><p> As polarisation and fragmentation have increased, bipartisan policies have become a lot more difficult to pursue. This trend is also reflected in declining public trust in expert opinion and established institutions.</p><p> And all this has supported the growth of more extreme political parties and/or anti-establishment movements. The middle is also proving less friendly and stable for business.</p><p> In sector after sector, mid-size companies face greater competition from small disruptors and/or their large counterparts. This includes the financial sector, where higher regulatory and compliance costs have eaten away at the sustainability of mid-size providers.</p><p> This is visible in the number of mergers among mid-size asset managers that lack a strong corporate parent. Sports, too, is losing its middle.</p><p> In the absence of forced equalisation mechanisms (such as those used in the United States' National Football League), European soccer is now dominated by a handful of teams that have become business behemoths. This last example also sheds light on important questions concerning what lies ahead.</p><p> Is the erosion of the middle really inevitable? Are we in the midst of what economists call \"multiple equilibria\", in which one unfavourable shift makes another, even worse, shift more probable? Or will a mix of natural mean reversion and responsive policies restore the soundness and benefits of the centre? Given the rapid changes in technology and political disruptions, it is hard to know what lies ahead. But there seem to be enough indicators to suggest that, in certain areas, a strong middle can indeed be reclaimed if policies adapt quickly enough.</p><p> That is probably the case when it comes to economic policies, where there is at last greater recognition of the importance of structural changes and distributional effects. For example, economists are beginning to resist the inclination to rely on too many simplifying assumptions that facilitate modeling but are removed from reality.</p><p> They are also beginning to redress the inadequate inclusion of financial linkages and insights from behavioural science, as well as overemphasis on single equilibrium conditions. And they are deepening their understanding of accelerating structural changes associated with technology, the impact of China and other emerging economies, and the politics of anger.</p><p> The more these changes feed into better policies, the greater the potential for political parties to present more compelling agendas. The decline of the middle in business is also likely to result in some pushback, though the impact will differ by industry and will be challenged by headwinds.</p><p> It is more likely to occur in some industries, such as big tech, where a regulatory response will probably be one outcome of a developing backlash, and less likely for asset management. These developments have the potential to slow what, for now, has been a self-reinforcing migration away from the middle.</p><p> But restoring faith in the feasibility and desirability of the middle -- belief that the middle is strong enough to promote stability and prosperity -- will take time, and sustained effort. And that loss of faith, compounded by technological change and the fragmentation of international order, goes a long way toward explaining why the future seems less predictable, and why the average person feels more unsettled.</p><p>-PROJECT SYNDICATE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNGPST-BANG27032018012447</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNGPST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RYX-B4C1-JCH9-G01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410348</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Bangkok Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Bangkok Post (Thailand)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 27, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002PWJ</classCode><className>ALLIANZ SE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>ALV (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>ALV (BIT)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A498</classCode><className>MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

These speeches assert that China has become an authoritarian state that is driven by a Communist ideology, is seeking to become the world\u2019s dominant power, and is using methods of competition that are illegal and violate international norms.</p><p>Secretary of State Pompeo made this clear in the last \u2013 and most definitive \u2013 of these five speeches by stating that,</p><p>\u2026 we have to admit a hard truth. We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won\u2019t get it done. We must not continue it and we must not return to it.</p><p>\u2026 We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the Chinese Communist Party exploit our free and open society. China sent propagandists into our press conferences, our research centers, our high-schools, our colleges, and even into our PTA meetings\u2026We marginalized our friends in Taiwan, which later blossomed into a vigorous democracy\u2026We gave the Chinese Communist Party and the regime itself special economic treatment, only to see the CCP insist on silence over its human rights abuses as the price of admission for Western companies entering China.</p><p>\u2026 we have to keep in mind that the CCP regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology. It\u2019s this ideology, it\u2019s this ideology that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them.</p><p>\u2026 the only way to truly change communist China is to act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave. And you can see American policy responding to this conclusion. President Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d When it comes to the CCP, I say we must distrust and verify.</p><p>... We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to change, just as President Nixon wanted. We must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing\u2019s actions threaten our people and our prosperity.</p><p>... We must start by changing how our people and our partners perceive the Chinese Communist Party. We have to tell the truth. We can\u2019t treat this incarnation of China as a normal country, just like any other.</p><p>The previous speeches each addressed key areas of Chinese competition that the speaker felt violated international norms and legitimate forms of competition, and in doing so, threatened the U.S and its allies. Each made it clear that China had evolved into an increasing threat.</p><p>This analysis provides the key excerpts from each speech. It traces the full set of arguments advanced by the top officials of the United States government. It highlights each of the specific examples which cite Chinese behavior that threaten the U.S and other states \u2013 and also serves as a reference for what could be the most important shifts in U.S policy towards China and its relations with the United States and the world since President Nixon\u2019s opening to China in 1971-1972.</p><p>At the same time, the analysis that follows shows these speeches raise five critical issues for U.S politics, strategy, and action in dealing with China:</p><p>Is this view of China correct, and does it offer the best option for dealing with China in the future? Is this view of China one that has bipartisan support in the U.S and will endure beyond the coming election? The current U.S national strategy addresses both China and Russia as major competitors, as well as far less serious threats from nations like Iran and North Korea. What is the U.S position on Russia? What changes are required in U.S strategy and to what extent can the U.S create global support for its position? How does the U.S build domestic and international support for such a position and show that its stance is valid?</p><p>In each case, it is clear that these speeches raise critical challenges, but they do not provide workable answers to any of these questions.Five Key Speeches That Change U.S Policy from Competition to Confrontation</p><p>Senior Administration officials \u2013 ranging from the Director of the FBI to the Secretary of State \u2013 have given four speeches and statements that have charged China with actively violating and undermining international values and competing on illegal terms \u2013 singling out Chairman Xi Jinping \u2013 who has served as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) since 2012, and President of the People's Republic of China (PRC) since 2013.</p><p>National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien, \u201cThe Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Ideology and Global Ambitions,\u201d Speech, Arizona Commerce Authority, Phoenix, Arizona, June 26, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/chinese-communist-partys-ideology-global-ambitions/\">https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/chinese-communist-partys-ideology-global-ambitions/</url> FBI Director Christopher Wray, \u201cThe Threat Posed by the Chinese Government and the Chinese Communist Party to the Economic and National Security of the United States,\u201d Speech, Hudson Institute, Washington D.C , July 7, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states\">https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/the-threat-posed-by-the-chinese-government-and-the-chinese-communist-party-to-the-economic-and-national-security-of-the-united-states</url> Attorney General William Barr, \u201cRemarks on China Policy,\u201d Speech, General R.

The equivalent of a fifth speech was added in the form of a statement that dealt with Chinese claims in the South China Sea, Taiwan, and Japan \u2013 made at a time when Chinese and U.S military activity in the region had reached near record heights.</p><p>Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, Statement on \u201cU.S Position on Maritime Claims in the South China Sea,\u201d U.S State Department, July 13, 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.state.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in\">https://www.state.gov/u-s-position-on-maritime-claims-in</url> the-south-china-sea/.</p><p>Examining the Key Quotes from Each Speech: Sometimes Words Really Matter</p><p>These speeches have all been reported in a summarized form in U.S and global media, but their content and importance has been overshadowed by the Coronavirus, U.S domestic politics, the closing of the Chinese consulate in Houston and the U.S consulate in Wuhan, the crisis in Hong Kong, and a host of other global crisis and conflicts. They are cases, however, where words really matter, and where the charges made against China now need as much open source verification as possible.</p><p>The actual contents of each speech are also important because they make a major shift in the way the U.S assesses Chinese competition and the Chinese threat. These five speeches and statements, U.S strategy documents, U.S defense budgets, and U.S annual threat assessments all illustrate the fact that the United States, its allies, and its strategic partners not only face a wide range of military threats from China, but they also face a continuing set of civil threats as well.</p><p>The U.S has now taken the official position that its confrontation with China is a civil-military or \u201cwhole of government\u201d challenge \u2013 where the civil challenge may pose even more of a threat than the military one. As documents like the Defense Intelligence Agency\u2019s annual report on Chinese Military Power make all too clear, the U.S does face serious military challenges from China and must deter and defend against the risk of major conventional and nuclear wars.</p><p>The U.S has now made it equally clear, however, that this is only part of the story. The U.S must deal with ongoing, constant economic and technological challenges that either do not directly involve the use of military forces or limit it to demonstrative military actions; the use of third country state or non-state actors and limited clashes; as well as the almost invisible use of information, disinformation, and cyberwarfare as a different kind of weaponry.</p><p>At the same time, the speeches became steadily more hardline and confrontational. They progressed from relatively normal reporting on potential threat behavior to a final Pompeo speech that attacked the leadership of China on the basis that the United States, it allies, and the world could not coexist with China\u2019s current behavior. Tracking this escalating rhetoric is as important to understanding the shift in the U.S position from a strategy of competition to confrontation as focusing on the indictments each speech made of China\u2019s behavior.The Threat from Information Warfare and Propaganda</p><p>The first speech, by National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien, set the stage by addressing China\u2019s leadership, ideology, and conduct by stating that the U.S had long failed to understand the true nature of China\u2019s behavior. It was a tightly written speech which has to be read in full to understand its full impact, but some key quotes show the themes that were repeated in the speeches that followed:</p><p>America, under President Trump\u2019s leadership, has finally awoken to the threat the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s actions and the threat they pose to our very way of life. For decades, conventional wisdom in both U.S political parties, the business community, academia, and media, has held that it was only a matter of time before China would become more liberal, first economically and, then, politically. The more we opened our markets to China, the thinking went, the more we invested capital in China, the more we trained PRC bureaucrats, scientists, engineers, and even military officers, the more China would become like us.</p><p>It was under this premise that we welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 with vast concessions and trade privileges. We downplayed China\u2019s gross human rights abuses, including Tiananmen Square. We turned a blind eye to China\u2019s widespread technology theft that eviscerated entire sectors of the American economy.</p><p>As China grew richer and stronger, we believed, the Chinese Communist Party would liberalize to meet the rising democratic aspirations of its people. This was a bold, quintessentially American idea, born of our innate optimism and by the experience of our triumph over Soviet Communism. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very na\u00efve.</p><p>We could not have been more wrong\u2014and this miscalculation is the greatest failure of American foreign policy since the 1930s. How did we make such a mistake? How did we fail to understand the nature of the Chinese Communist Party?</p><p>The answer is simple: because we did not pay heed to the CCP\u2019s ideology. Instead of listening to what CCP leaders were saying and reading what they wrote in their key documents, we closed our ears and our eyes. We believed what we wanted to believe\u2014that the Party members were communist in name only.</p><p>Let us be clear, the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist organization. The Party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Josef Stalin\u2019s successor. In fact, as the journalist and former Australian government official John Garnaut has noted, the Chinese Communist Party is the last \u201cruling communist party that never split with Stalin, with the partial exception of North Korea.\u201d [1] Yes, Stalin \u2013 the man whose brutal dictatorship and disastrous policies killed roughly 20 million Russians and others through famine, forced collectivization, executions, and labor camps. As interpreted and practiced by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, communism is a totalitarian ideology.</p><p>Under communism, individuals are merely a means to be used toward the achievement of the ends of the collective nation state. Thus, individuals can be easily sacrificed for the nation state\u2019s goals. Individuals do not have inherent value under Marxism-Leninism. They exist to serve the state; the state does not exist to serve them. These ideas sound remote and outdated to us. They are, after all, old ideas\u2014they were born a century and a half ago in Europe. They were implemented a century ago by Russia, and then discarded 30 years ago as the most costly failed political experiment in history. But in China, these ideas remain as fundamental to the Chinese Communist Party as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights do to us as Americans.</p><p>The Chinese Communist Party seeks total control over the people\u2019s lives. This means economic control, it means political control, it means physical control, and, perhaps most importantly, it means thought control.</p><p>\u201cIn Classical Chinese statecraft,\u201d Garnaut has noted, \u201cthere are two tools for gaining and maintaining control over \u2018the mountains and the rivers\u2019: the first is wu (\u6b66), weapons and violence, and the second is wen (\u6587), language and culture. Chinese leaders have always believed that power derives from controlling both the physical battlefield and the cultural domain.\u201d \u201cFor Lenin, Stalin, Mao and Xi,\u201d Garnaut writes, \u201cwords are not vehicles of reason and persuasion. They are bullets. Words are for defining, isolating, and destroying opponents.\u201d</p><p>At the same time, O\u2019Brien gave specific examples Chinese activities \u2013 many of which characterize Russia\u2019s behavior as well:</p><p>Over the past decade, the Party has invested billions of dollars into overseas propaganda operations to great effect. The CCP has moved to eliminate \u2018unfriendly\u2019 Chinese language media outlets worldwide, and is close to succeeding. Nearly every Chinese language news outlet in the U.S is either owned by, or works closely with the Party\u2014and it is making inroads into English language media as well. There are more than a dozen radio stations in cities across the country where Americans hear subtle pro-Beijing propaganda on their FM radio.</p><p>Recently, Chinese propaganda persuaded so many Americans that a U.S solider had brought the coronavirus to Wuhan\u2014as opposed to Wuhan sending the virus to the rest of the world (a complete fabrication by the CCP) that this soldier and her family needed a personal security detail to protect them from death threats. This situation occurred in Maryland.</p><p>On TikTok, a Chinese-owned social media platform with over 40 million American users\u2014probably a lot of your kids and younger colleagues\u2013 accounts criticizing CCP policies are routinely removed or deleted.</p><p>Last week, Twitter announced the suspension of more than 23,000 CCP linked accounts for spreading propaganda on Hong Kong and COVID-19. This latest suspension was in addition to last August\u2019s removal of more than 150,000 CCP linked accounts that were used to spread anti-American disinformation and generate the illusion of popular support for Beijing\u2019s policies in the United States. These are just the accounts Twitter caught. How many are still out there undetected?</p><p>In March, the CCP expelled American journalists working for the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, almost fully eliminating independent reporting from within China on the Wuhan virus.</p><p>In addition to influencing what information American citizens receive regarding China, the CCP is increasingly using its leverage to police American speech. When the University of California at San Diego hosted the Dalai Lama as a commencement speaker in 2017, Beijing banned Chinese students from visiting UCSD on government funds.</p><p>When the general manager of the Houston Rockets tweeted his support for the peaceful Hong Kong protesters, the CCP announced its team\u2019s games would not be shown on Chinese TV and used its economic power to pressure others in basketball, including star players, to criticize the tweet on behalf of Beijing.</p><p>Under pressure from the CCP, Marriott, and American, Delta, and United Airlines all removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites. Mercedes Benz even apologized for posting an inspirational quote from the Dalai Lama on social media.</p><p>Beijing has used its financial might and market access to pressure Hollywood into self-censorship, incentivizing directors and producers to avoid topics that might not make it past the country\u2019s censors in China. For example, the Japanese and Taiwanese flags were dropped from Tom Cruise\u2019s flight jacket in the upcoming Top Gun sequel \u201cMaverick.\u201d MGM digitally changed the identities, post-production, of the invading military from China to North Korea in the \u201cRed Dawn\u201d remake.</p><p>The CCP is seeking leverage over individual Americans as well. The Party is collecting your most intimate data\u2014your words, your actions, your purchases, your whereabouts, your health records, your social media posts, your texts, and mapping your network of friends, family, and acquaintances.</p><p>The CCP accomplishes this goal, in part, by subsidizing hardware, software, telecommunications, and even genetics companies. As a result, corporations such as Huawei and ZTE undercut competitors on price and install their equipment around the globe at a loss. This has the side effect of putting out of business American manufacturers of telecom hardware and has made it very difficult for Nokia and Ericsson. Why do they do it? Because it is not telecom hardware or software profits the CCP are after, it is your data. They use \u201cbackdoors\u201d built into the products to obtain that data.</p><p>When the Chinese Communist Party cannot buy your data, it steals it. In 2014, the CCP hacked Anthem insurance, collecting sensitive information on 80 million Americans. In 2015, the CCP hacked the Office of Personnel Management, which holds security clearance information, acquiring sensitive data on 20 million Americans who work for the federal government. In 2017, it hacked Equifax, obtaining the names, birthdates, social security numbers, and credit scores of 145 million Americans.</p><p>In 2019, the CCP hacked Marriot, gathering information on 383 million guests, including their passport numbers. And, in 2016, a Chinese company even bought the dating app Grindr to harvest its data, including the HIV status of users, before the U.S government forced a divestiture on national security grounds. These are just a few of the instances we know about.</p><p>How will the Chinese Communist Party use this data? In the same way it uses data within China\u2019s borders: to target, to flatter, to cajole, to influence, to coerce, and to even blackmail individuals to say and do things that serve the Party\u2019s interests. This is \u2018micro targeting\u2019 beyond an advertiser\u2019s wildest dreams. China, unlike advertisers, will not be stopped by government regulations. The Chinese Communist Party simply wants to know everything about you\u2014just as it likes to know almost everything about every individual living in China.</p><p>In addition to propaganda and influence operations, the Chinese Communist Party uses trade to coerce compliance with its dictates. When Australia called for an independent investigation of the coronavirus\u2019 origins and spread, the Chinese Communist Party threatened to stop buying Australian agricultural products and to prevent Chinese students and tourists from traveling to Australia. When Australia refused to relent, Beijing put these threats into force, imposing an 80% tariff on Australian barley exports.</p><p>International organizations are also part of China\u2019s plan. China has sought leadership positions within many global bodies. China now heads four out of fifteen UN specialized agencies, more than the U.S , UK, France, and Russia, the other members of the permanent members of the U.NSecurity Council, combined. The PRC uses these leaders to force the international bodies to parrot Beijing\u2019s talking points and to install Chinese telecommunications equipment in their facilities.</p><p>For example, since Zhao Houlin of the International Telecommunications Union took his post he began to aggressively promote Huawei sales. Secretary-General Fang Liu of the International Civil Aviation Organization has blocked Taiwan\u2019s participation in General Assembly meetings and covered up a Chinese hack of the organization. The Party has used China\u2019s membership on the UN Human Rights Council to prevent criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong.</p><p>The CCP\u2019s reach extends to heads of international organizations who are not themselves Chinese officials. Under Beijing\u2019s thumb, and at an unacceptable cost to human life, Director-General Tedros of the World Health Organization dutifully used Chinese talking points on the Wuhan virus. As late as mid-January, he claimed there was no human-to-human transmission of the disease. He opposed international travel restrictions. At the same time, Tedros praised China\u2019s own domestic travel restrictions on Wuhan residents. In other words, they could travel overseas, but they could not travel and potentially take the virus to Beijing or Shanghai. These CCP tactics in international organizations, as we have seen with the coronavirus, are a major cause of concern not just for the United States, but to the world.</p><p>The Threat from Cyber, Economic Espionage, Hacking, and Manipulating Academia and Research Activities</p><p>FBI Director Wray\u2019s speech was also very tightly written and carefully structured in content and tone. It limited its broad indictments of China, but key excerpts make it clear that it was part of the package of four speeches and referenced both the O\u2019Brien speech, warning that,</p><p>The greatest long-term threat to our nation\u2019s information and intellectual property, and to our economic vitality, is the counterintelligence and economic espionage threat from China. It\u2019s a threat to our economic security\u2014and by extension, to our national security\u2026 I will provide more detail on the Chinese threat than the FBI has ever presented in an open forum. This threat is so significant that the attorney general and secretary of state will also be addressing a lot of these issues in the next few weeks. But if you think these issues are just an intelligence issue, or a government problem, or a nuisance largely just for big corporations who can take care of themselves\u2014you could not be more wrong.</p><p>It\u2019s the people of the United States who are the victims of what amounts to Chinese theft on a scale so massive that it represents one of the largest transfers of wealth in human history. If you are an American adult, it is more likely than not that China has stolen your personal data.</p><p>In 2017, the Chinese military conspired to hack Equifax and made off with the sensitive personal information of 150 million Americans\u2014we\u2019re talking nearly half of the American population and most American adults\u2014and as I\u2019ll discuss in a few moments, this was hardly a standalone incident.</p><p>Our data isn\u2019t the only thing at stake here\u2014so are our health, our livelihoods, and our security. We\u2019ve now reached the point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases currently underway across the country, almost half are related to China. And at this very moment, China is working to compromise American health care organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and academic institutions conducting essential COVID-19 research.</p><p>But before I go on, let me be clear: This is not about the Chinese people, and it\u2019s certainly not about Chinese Americans. Every year, the United States welcomes more than 100,000 Chinese students and researchers into this country. For generations, people have journeyed from China to the United States to secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their families\u2014and our society is better for their contributions. So, when I speak of the threat from China, I mean the government of China and the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>\u2026First: We need to be clear-eyed about the scope of the Chinese government\u2019s ambition. China\u2014the Chinese Communist Party\u2014believes it is in a generational fight to surpass our country in economic and technological leadership\u2026 China is engaged in a whole-of-state effort to become the world\u2019s only superpower by any means necessary.</p><p>\u2026The second thing the American people need to understand is that China uses a diverse range of sophisticated techniques\u2014everything from cyber intrusions to corrupting trusted insiders. They\u2019ve even engaged in outright physical theft. And they\u2019ve pioneered an expansive approach to stealing innovation through a wide range of actors\u2014including not just Chinese intelligence services but state-owned enterprises, ostensibly private companies, certain kinds of graduate students and researchers, and a whole variety of other actors working on their behalf.</p><p>To achieve its goals and surpass America, China recognizes it needs to make leaps in cutting-edge technologies. But the sad fact is that instead of engaging in the hard slog of innovation, China often steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the very American companies it victimized\u2014in effect, cheating twice over. They\u2019re targeting research on everything from military equipment to wind turbines to rice and corn seeds.</p><p>Through its talent recruitment programs, like the so-called Thousand Talents Program, the Chinese government tries to entice scientists to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to China\u2014even if that means stealing proprietary information or violating our export controls and conflict-of-interest rules.</p><p>\u2026China uses a diverse range of sophisticated techniques\u2014everything from cyber intrusions to corrupting trusted insiders. They\u2019ve even engaged in outright physical theft. And they\u2019ve pioneered an expansive approach to stealing innovation through a wide range of actors\u2014including not just Chinese intelligence services but state-owned enterprises, ostensibly private companies, certain kinds of graduate students and researchers, and a whole variety of other actors working on their behalf.</p><p>Wray then went on to provide the following specific examples of the conduct he was addressing:</p><p>Economic Espionage</p><p>To achieve its goals and surpass America, China recognizes it needs to make leaps in cutting-edge technologies. But the sad fact is that instead of engaging in the hard slog of innovation, China often steals American intellectual property and then uses it to compete against the very American companies it victimized\u2014in effect, cheating twice over.

He applied to China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program and stole more than $1 billion\u2014that\u2019s with a \u201cb\u201d\u2014worth of trade secrets from his former employer, an Oklahoma-based petroleum company, and got caught. A few months ago, he was convicted and sent to prison.</p><p>Or there\u2019s the case of Shan Shi, a Texas-based scientist, also sentenced to prison earlier this year. Shi stole trade secrets regarding syntactic foam, an important naval technology used in submarines. Shi, too, had applied to China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program, and specifically pledged to \u201cdigest\u201d and \u201cabsorb\u201d the relevant technology in the United States. He did this on behalf of Chinese state-owned enterprises, which ultimately planned to put the American company out of business and take over the market.</p><p>In one of the more galling and egregious aspects of the scheme, the conspirators actually patented in China the very manufacturing process they\u2019d stolen, and then offered their victim American company a joint venture using its own stolen technology. We\u2019re talking about an American company that spent years and millions of dollars developing that technology, and China couldn\u2019t replicate it\u2014so, instead, it paid to have it stolen.</p><p>And just two weeks ago, Hao Zhang was convicted of economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, and conspiracy for stealing proprietary information about wireless devices from two U.S companies. One of those companies had spent over 20 years developing the technology Zhang stole.</p><p>These cases were among more than a thousand investigations the FBI has into China\u2019s actual and attempted theft of American technology\u2014which is to say nothing of over a thousand more ongoing counterintelligence investigations of other kinds related to China. We\u2019re conducting these kinds of investigations in all 56 of our field offices. And over the past decade, we\u2019ve seen economic espionage cases with a link to China increase by approximately 1,300 percent.</p><p>The stakes could not be higher, and the potential economic harm to American businesses and the economy as a whole almost defies calculation.</p><p>Clandestine Efforts</p><p>As National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien discussed in his June remarks, the Chinese government is also making liberal use of hacking to steal our corporate and personal data\u2014and they\u2019re using both military and non-state hackers to do it. The Equifax intrusion I mentioned just a few moments ago, which led to the indictment of Chinese military personnel, was hardly the only time China stole the sensitive personal information of huge numbers of the American public.</p><p>For example, did any of you have health insurance through Anthem or one of its associated insurers? In 2015, China\u2019s hackers stole the personal data of 80 million of that company\u2019s current and former customers.</p><p>Or maybe you\u2019re a federal employee\u2014or you used to be one, or you applied for a government job once, or a family member or roommate did. Well, in 2014, China\u2019s hackers stole more than 21 million records from OPM, the federal government\u2019s Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>Why are they doing this? First, China has made becoming an artificial intelligence world leader a priority, and these kinds of thefts feed right into China\u2019s development of artificial intelligence tools.</p><p>Compounding the threat, the data China stole is of obvious value as they attempt to identify people for secret intelligence gathering. On that front, China is using social media platforms\u2014the same ones Americans use to stay connected or find jobs\u2014to identify people with access to our government\u2019s sensitive information and then target those people to try to steal it.</p><p>Just to pick one example, a Chinese intelligence officer posing as a headhunter on a popular social media platform recently offered an American citizen a sizeable sum of money in exchange for so-called \u201cconsulting\u201d services. That sounds benign enough until you realize those \u201cconsulting\u201d services were related to sensitive information the American target had access to as a U.S military intelligence specialist.</p><p>Now that particular tale has a happy ending: The American citizen did the right thing and reported the suspicious contact, and the FBI, working together with our armed forces, took it from there. I wish I could say that all such incidents ended that way.</p><p>Threats to Academia</p><p>It\u2019s a troublingly similar story in academia.</p><p>Through talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program I mentioned just a few moments ago, China pays scientists at American universities to secretly bring our knowledge and innovation back to China\u2014including valuable, federally funded research. To put it bluntly, this means American taxpayers are effectively footing the bill for China\u2019s own technological development. China then leverages its ill-gotten gains to undercut U.S research institutions and companies, blunting our nation\u2019s advancement and costing American jobs. And we are seeing more and more of these cases.</p><p>In May alone, we arrested both Qing Wang, a former researcher with the Cleveland Clinic who worked on molecular medicine and the genetics of cardiovascular disease, and Simon Saw-Teong Ang, a University of Arkansas scientist doing research for NASA. Both of these guys were allegedly committing fraud by concealing their participation in Chinese talent recruitment programs while accepting millions of dollars in American federal grant funding.</p><p>That same month, former Emory University professor Xiao-Jiang Li pled guilty to filing a false tax return for failing to report the income he\u2019d received through China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program. Our investigation found that while Li was researching Huntington\u2019s disease at Emory, he was also pocketing half a million unreported dollars from China.</p><p>In a similar vein, Charles Lieber, chair of Harvard\u2019s Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, was indicted just last month for making false statements to federal authorities about his Thousand Talents participation. The United States has alleged that Lieber concealed from both Harvard and the NIH his position as a strategic scientist at a Chinese university\u2014and the fact that the Chinese government was paying him, through the Wuhan Institute of Technology, a $50,000 monthly stipend, more than $150,000 in living expenses, and more than $1.5 million to establish a laboratory back in China.</p><p>Malign Foreign Influence</p><p>There\u2019s more. Another tool China and the Chinese Communist Party use to manipulate Americans is what we call malign foreign influence.</p><p>Now, traditional foreign influence is a normal, legal diplomatic activity typically conducted through diplomatic channels. But malign foreign influence efforts are subversive, undeclared, criminal, or coercive attempts to sway our government\u2019s policies, distort our country\u2019s public discourse, and undermine confidence in our democratic processes and values.</p><p>China is engaged in a highly sophisticated malign foreign influence campaign, and its methods include bribery, blackmail, and covert deals. Chinese diplomats also use both open, naked economic pressure and seemingly independent middlemen to push China\u2019s preferences on American officials.</p><p>Just take one all-too-common illustration: Let\u2019s say China gets wind that some American official is planning to travel to Taiwan\u2014think a governor, a state senator, a member of Congress. China does not want that to happen, because that travel might appear to legitimize Taiwanese independence from China\u2014and legitimizing Taiwan would, of course, be contrary to China\u2019s \u201cOne China\u201d policy.</p><p>So what does China do? Well, China has leverage over the American official\u2019s constituents\u2014American companies, academics, and members of the media all have legitimate and understandable reasons to want access to Chinese partners and markets. And because of the authoritarian nature of the Chinese Communist Party, China has immense power over those same partners and markets. So, China will sometimes start by trying to influence the American official overtly and directly. China might openly warn that if the American official goes ahead and takes that trip to Taiwan, China will take it out on a company from that official\u2019s home state by withholding the company\u2019s license to manufacture in China. That could be economically ruinous for the company, would directly pressure the American official to alter his travel plans, and the official would know that China was trying to influence him.</p><p>That would be bad enough. But the Chinese Communist Party often doesn\u2019t stop there; it can\u2019t stop there if it wants to stay in power\u2014so it uses its leverage even more perniciously. If China\u2019s more direct, overt influence campaign doesn\u2019t do the trick, they sometimes turn to indirect, covert, deceptive influence efforts.</p><p>To continue with the illustration of the American official with travel plans that the Chinese Communist Party doesn\u2019t like, China will work relentlessly to identify the people closest to that official\u2014the people that official trusts most. China will then work to influence those people to act on China\u2019s behalf as middlemen to influence the official. The co-opted middlemen may then whisper in the official\u2019s ear and try to sway the official\u2019s travel plans or public positions on Chinese policy. These intermediaries, of course, aren\u2019t telling the American official that they\u2019re Chinese Communist Party pawns\u2014and worse still, some of these intermediaries may not even realize they\u2019re being used as pawns, because they, too, have been deceived.</p><p>Ultimately, China doesn\u2019t hesitate to use smoke, mirrors, and misdirection to influence Americans.</p><p>Similarly, China often pushes academics and journalists to self-censor if they want to travel into China. And we\u2019ve seen the Chinese Communist Party pressure American media and sporting giants to ignore or suppress criticism of China\u2019s ambitions regarding Hong Kong or Taiwan. This kind of thing is happening over and over, across the United States.</p><p>And I will note that the pandemic has unfortunately not stopped any of this\u2014in fact, we have heard from federal, state, and even local officials that Chinese diplomats are aggressively urging support for China\u2019s handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Yes, this is happening at both the federal and state levels. Not that long ago, we had a state senator who was recently even asked to introduce a resolution supporting China\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p><p>The punchline is this: All of these seemingly inconsequential pressures add up to a policymaking environment in which Americans find themselves held over a barrel by the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>Threats to the Rule of Law</p><p>All the while, China\u2019s government and Communist Party have brazenly violated well-settled norms and the rule of law.</p><p>Since 2014, Chinese General Secretary Xi Jinping has spearheaded a program known as \u201cFox Hunt.\u201d Now, China describes Fox Hunt as some kind of international anti-corruption campaign\u2014it is not. Instead, Fox Hunt is a sweeping bid by General Secretary Xi to target Chinese nationals whom he sees as threats and who live outside China, across the world. We\u2019re talking about political rivals, dissidents, and critics seeking to expose China\u2019s extensive human rights violations.</p><p>Hundreds of the Fox Hunt victims that they target live right here in the United States, and many are American citizens or green card holders. The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China, and China\u2019s tactics to accomplish that are shocking. For example, when it couldn\u2019t locate one Fox Hunt target, the Chinese government sent an emissary to visit the target\u2019s family here in the United States. The message they said to pass on? The target had two options: return to China promptly, or commit suicide. And what happens when Fox Hunt targets refuse to return to China? In the past, their family members both here in the United States and in China have been threatened and coerced, and those back in China have even been arrested for leverage.</p><p>The Threat from a Global Economic Challenge</p><p>Attorney General Barr\u2019s speech used harder line rhetoric, but drew on the O\u2019Brien and Wray speeches and also mentioned the fourth Pompeo speech to come. Excepts show it was clearly focused on confrontation with both China\u2019s leadership and its political system,</p><p>I\u2019m privileged to speak here today about what may prove to be the most important issue for our nation and the world in the twenty-first century and that is, the United States\u2019 response to the global ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party. The CCP rules with an iron fist over one of the great ancient civilizations of the world. It seeks to leverage the immense power, productivity, and ingenuity of the Chinese people to overthrow the rule-based international system and to make the world safe for dictatorship. How the United States responds to this challenge will have historic implications and will determine whether the United States and its liberal democratic allies will continue to shape their own destiny or whether the CCP and its autocratic tributaries will continue, will control the future. Since the 1890\u2019s, at least, the United States has been the technological leader of the world. And from that prowess, has come our prosperity, the opportunity for generations of Americans, and our security. It\u2019s because of that that we were able to play such a pivotal role in world history, but turning back the threat of fascism and the threat of communism. What\u2019s at stake these days is whether we can maintain that leadership position and that technological leadership. Are we going to be the generation that has allowed that to be stolen- which is really stealing the future of our children and our grandchildren?</p><p>Several weeks ago, National Security Advisor Robert O\u2019Brien spoke about the CCP\u2019s ideology and global ambitions. He declared, and I agree, that \u201cthe days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People\u2019s Republic of China are over.\u201d And last week, the FBI Director Chris Wray, described how the CCP pursues its ambitions through the nefarious and even illegal conduct, including industrial espionage, theft, extortion, cyberattacks, and malign influence activities. In the coming days, you will hear from Secretary Mike Pompeo, who will sum up what is at stake for the United States and the free world. Now, Chris Wray, told me that shortly after his speech last week, one of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party pronounced that his speech was particularly disgusting. I told him that I was going to aim to be despicable, but I\u2019ll settle for especially disgusting. But no matter how the Chinese seek to characterize it I do hope that my speech and Mike Pompeo speech will encourage the American people to reevaluate their relationship with China, so long as it continues to be ruled by the Chinese Communist Party. It is fitting that were here today at the Ford Presidential Museum. Gerald Ford served in the highest echelons of the government at the dawn of America's reengagement with China, which began obviously with President Nixon in 1972, and three years later in 1975, President Ford visited China for a summit with PRC leaders including Mao Zedong.</p><p>At the time it was unthinkable that China would emerge after the Cold War as a near-peer competitor of the United States. And even then, there were signs of China's immense latent power. In the joint report of their visit to China in 1972, House Majority Leader Hale Boggs and then minority leader Gerald Ford wrote: \u201cIf she manages to achieve as she aspires, China in the next half century can emerge as a self-sufficient power of a billion people\u2026 this last impression \u2013 of the reality of China's colossal potential \u2013 is perhaps the most vivid of our journey. As our small party traveled through that boundless land, this sense of a giant stirring, a dragon waking, gave us much to ponder.\u201d It is now nearly fifty years later and the pressing pondering as of these two congressmen have come to pass.</p><p>Deng Xiaoping, whose economic reform launched China's remarkable rise had a famous motto: \u201chide your strength and bide your time.\u201d That is precisely what China has done. China's economy has quietly grown from about 2 percent of the world's GDP in 1980, to nearly 20 percent today. And by some estimates based on purchasing parity, the Chinese economy is already larger than ours. The General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, who has centralized power to a degree not seen since the dictatorship of Mao Zedong, now speaks openly of China moving closer to the center stage, building a socialism that is superior to capitalism, and replacing the American dream with the Chinese solution. China is no longer hiding it strength nor biding its time. From the perspective of its communist rulers, China's time has arrived.</p><p>Barr then focused on what he called an \u201ceconomic blitzkrieg\u2014an aggressive, orchestrated, whole-of-government (indeed, whole-of-society) campaign to seize the commanding heights of the global economy and to surpass the United States as the world\u2019s preeminent technological superpower.\u201d</p><p>A centerpiece of this effort is the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d initiative, a plan for PRC domination of high-tech industries like robotics, advanced information technology, aviation, and electric vehicles, and many other technologies. Backed by hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies, this initiative poses a real threat to U.S technological leadership. Despite World Trade Organization rules prohibiting quotas for domestic output, \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d sets targets for domestic market share (sometimes as high as 70 percent) in core components and basic materials for industries such as robotics and telecommunications. It is clear that the PRC seeks not merely to join the ranks of other advanced industrial economies, but to replace them altogether.</p><p>\u201cMade in China 2025\u201d is the latest iteration of the PRC\u2019s state-led, mercantilist economic model. For American companies in the global marketplace, free and fair competition with China has long been a fantasy. To tilt the playing field to its advantage, China\u2019s communist government has perfected a wide array of predatory and often unlawful tactics: currency manipulation, tariffs, quotas, state-led strategic investment and acquisitions, theft and forced transfer of intellectual property, state subsidies, dumping, cyberattacks, and industrial espionage. About 80% of all federal economic espionage prosecutions have alleged conduct that would benefit the Chinese state, and about 60% of all trade secret theft cases have been connected to China.</p><p>The PRC also seeks to dominate key trade routes and infrastructure in Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific. In the South China Sea, for example, through which about one-third of the world\u2019s maritime trade passes, the PRC has asserted expansive and historically dubious claims to nearly the entire waterway, flouted the rulings of international courts, built artificial islands and placed military outposts on them, and harassed its neighbors\u2019 ships and fishing boats.</p><p>Another ambitious project to spread its power and influence is the PRC\u2019s \u201cBelt and Road\u201d infrastructure initiative. Although billed as \u201cforeign aid,\u201d in fact these investments appear designed to serve the PRC\u2019s strategic interests and domestic economic needs. For example, the PRC has been criticized for loading poor countries up with debt, refusing to renegotiate terms, and then taking control of the infrastructure itself, as it did with the Sri Lankan port of Hambantota in 2017. This is little more than a form of modern-day colonialism.</p><p>Just as consequential, however, are the PRC\u2019s plans to dominate the world\u2019s digital infrastructure through its \u201cDigital Silk Road\u201d initiative. I have previously spoken at length about the grave risks of allowing the world\u2019s most powerful dictatorship to build the next generation of global telecommunications networks, known as 5G. Perhaps less widely known are the PRC\u2019s efforts to surpass the United States in other cutting-edge fields, like artificial intelligence. Through innovations such as machine learning and big data, artificial intelligence allows machines to mimic human functions, such as recognizing faces, interpreting spoken words, driving vehicles, and playing games of skill, much like chess or the even more complex Chinese game, Go. In 2017, Beijing unveiled its \u201cNext Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan,\u201d a blueprint for leading the world in AI by 2030. Whichever nation emerges as the global leader in AI will be best positioned to unlock not only its considerable economic potential, but a range of military applications, such as the use of computer vision to gather intelligence.</p><p>The PRC\u2019s drive for technological supremacy is complemented by its plan to monopolize rare earth materials, which play a vital role in industries such as consumer electronics, electric vehicles, medical devices, and military hardware. According to the Congressional Research Service, from the 1960s to the 1980s, the United States led the world in rare earth production. \u201cSince then, production has shifted almost entirely to China,\u201d in large part due to lower labor costs and lighter economic and environmental regulation.</p><p>The United States is now dangerously dependent on the PRC for these essential materials. Overall, China is America\u2019s top supplier, accounting for about 80 percent of our imports. The risks of dependence are real. In 2010, for example, Beijing cut exports of rare earth materials to Japan after an incident involving disputed islands in the East China Sea. The PRC could do the same to us. As China\u2019s progress in these critical sectors illustrates, the PRC\u2019s predatory economic policies are succeeding. For a hundred years, America was the world\u2019s largest manufacturer \u2014 allowing us to serve as the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of democracy.\u201d China overtook the United States in manufacturing output in 2010. The PRC is now the world\u2019s \u201carsenal of dictatorship.\u201d</p><p>How did China accomplish all this? No one should underestimate the ingenuity and industry of the Chinese people. At the same time, no one should doubt that America made China\u2019s meteoric rise possible. China has reaped enormous benefits from the free flow of American aid and trade. In 1980, Congress granted the PRC most-favored-nation trading status. In the 1990s, American companies strongly supported the PRC\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization and the permanent normalization of trade relations. Today, U.S -China trade totals about $700 billion.</p><p>Last year, Newsweek ran a cover story titled \u201cHow America\u2019s Biggest Companies Made China Great Again.\u201d The article details how China\u2019s communist leaders lured American business with the promise of market access, and then, having profited from American investment and know-how, turned increasingly hostile. The PRC used tariffs and quotas to pressure American companies to give up their technology and form joint ventures with Chinese companies. Regulators then discriminated against American firms, using tactics like holding up permits. Yet few companies, even Fortune 500 giants, have been willing to bring a formal trade complaint for fear of angering Beijing.</p><p>Just as American companies have become dependent on the Chinese market, the United States as a whole now relies on the PRC for many vital goods and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown a spotlight on that dependency. For example, China is the world\u2019s largest producer of certain protective equipment, such as face masks and medical gowns. In March, as the pandemic spread around the world, the PRC hoarded the masks for itself, blocking producers \u2014 including American companies \u2014 from exporting them to other countries that needed them. It then attempted to exploit the shortage for propaganda purposes, shipping limited quantities of often defective equipment and requiring foreign leaders to publicly thank Beijing for these shipments.</p><p>China\u2019s dominance of the world market for medical goods goes beyond masks and gowns. It has become the United States\u2019 largest supplier of medical devices, while at the same time discriminating against American medical companies in China. China\u2019s government has targeted foreign firms for greater regulatory scrutiny, instructed Chinese hospitals to buy products made in China, and pressured American firms to build factories in China, where their intellectual property is more vulnerable to theft. As one expert has observed, American medical device manufacturers are effectively \u201ccreating their own competitors.\u201d</p><p>America also depends on Chinese supply, Chinese supply chains in other vital sectors, especially pharmaceuticals. America remains the global leader in drug discovery, but China is now the world\u2019s largest producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, known as \u201cAPIs.\u201d As one Defense Health Agency official noted, \u201c[s]hould China decide to limit or restrict the delivery of APIs to the [United States],\u201d it \u201ccould result in severe shortages of pharmaceuticals for both domestic and military uses.\u201d</p><p>To achieve dominance in pharmaceuticals, China\u2019s rulers went to the same playbook they\u2019ve used to gut other American industries. In 2008, the PRC designated pharmaceutical production as a \u201chigh-value-added-industry\u201d and boosted Chinese companies with subsidies and export tax rebates. Meanwhile, the PRC has systematically preyed on American companies. American firms face well-known obstacles in China\u2019s health market, including drug approval delays, unfair pricing limitations, IP theft, and counterfeiting. Chinese nationals working as employees at pharma companies have been caught stealing trade secrets both in America and in China. And the CCP has long engaged in cyber-espionage and hacking of U.S academic medical centers and healthcare companies.</p><p>Barr also highlighted examples of actions by U.S companies that he felt facilitated China\u2019s success, citing leading U.S firms by name,</p><p>\u2026In fact, PRC-linked hackers have targeted American universities and firms in a bid to steal IP related to coronavirus treatments and vaccines, sometimes disrupting the work of our researchers. Having been caught covering up the coronavirus outbreak, Beijing is desperate for a public relations coup, and may hope that it will be able to claim credit for any medical breakthroughs.</p><p>\u2026Take Hollywood. Hollywood\u2019s actors, producers, and directors pride themselves on celebrating freedom and the human spirit. And every year at the Academy Awards, Americans are lectured about how this country falls short of Hollywood\u2019s ideals of social justice. But Hollywood now regularly censors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world\u2019s most powerful violator of human rights. This censorship infects not only versions of movies that are released in China, but also many that are shown in American theaters to American audiences.</p><p>For example, the hit movie World War Z depicts a zombie apocalypse caused by a virus. The original version of the film reportedly contained a scene with characters speculating that the virus may have originated in China. But the studio, Paramount Pictures, reportedly told producers to delete the reference to China in the hope of landing a Chinese distribution deal. The deal never materialized.</p><p>In the Marvel Studios blockbuster Dr. Strange, filmmakers changed the nationality of a major character known as the \u201cAncient One,\u201d a Tibetan monk in the comic book, changed it from Tibetan to Celtic. When challenged about this, a screenwriter explained that \u201cif you acknowledge that Tibet is a place and that he\u2019s Tibetan, you risk alienating one billion people.\u201d Or, as the Chinese government might say, \u201c[w]e\u2019re not going to show your movie because you decided to get political.\u201d</p><p>These are just two examples of the many Hollywood films that have been altered, one way or another, to please the CCP. National Security Advisor O\u2019Brien offered even more examples in his remarks. But many more scripts never see the light of day, because writers and producers know not to even test the limits. Chinese government censors don\u2019t need to say a word, because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>The story of the film industry\u2019s submission to the CCP is a familiar one. In the past two decades, China has emerged as the world\u2019s largest box office. The CCP has long tightly controlled access to that lucrative market \u2014 both through quotas on American films, imposed in violation of China\u2019s WTO obligations, and a strict censorship regime. Increasingly, Hollywood also relies on Chinese money for financing. In 2018, films with Chinese investors accounted for 20 percent of U.S box-office ticket sales, compared to only three percent five years earlier.</p><p>But in the long run, as with other American industries, the PRC may be less interested in cooperating with Hollywood than in co-opting Hollywood \u2014 and eventually replacing it with its own homegrown productions. To accomplish this, the CCP has been following its usual modus operandi. By imposing a quota on American films, the CCP pressures Hollywood studios to form joint ventures with Chinese companies, who then gain U.S technology and know-how. As one Chinese film executive recently put it, \u201c[e]verything we learned, we learned from Hollywood.\u201d Notably, in 2019, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in China were produced in China.</p><p>Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America\u2019s big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence. In the year 2000, when the United States normalized trade relations with China, President Clinton hailed the new century as one in which \u201cliberty will be spread by cell phone and cable modem.\u201d Instead, over the course of the next decade, American companies, such as Cisco, helped the Communist Party build the Great Firewall of China \u2014 the world\u2019s most sophisticated system for Internet surveillance and censorship.</p><p>Over the years, corporations such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Apple have shown themselves all too willing to collaborate with the CCP. For example, Apple recently removed the news app Quartz from its app store in China, after the Chinese government complained about the coverage of the Hong Kong democracy protests. Apple also removed apps for virtual private networks, which had allowed users to circumvent the Great Firewall, and eliminated pro-democracy songs from its Chinese music store. Meanwhile, the company announced that it would be transferring some of its iCloud data to servers in China, despite concerns that the move would give the Communist Party easier access to e-mails, text messages, and other user information stored in the iCloud.</p><p>Recently, we were able to get into two cell phones used by the Al-Qaeda terrorist who shot eight Americans at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. During the gun fight with him, he stopped, disengaged, put his cell phones down and tried to destroy them, shooting a bullet into one of his two cell phones and we thought that suggested that there may be very important information about terrorist activities in those cell phones. And for four and a half months we tried to get in, without any help at all from Apple. Apple failed to give us any help getting into the cell phones. We were ultimately able to get in through a fluke that we will not be able to reproduce in the future, where we found communications with Al-Qaeda operatives in the Middle East up to the day before the attack. Do you think when Apple sells phones in China that Apple phones in China are impervious to penetration by Chinese authorities? They wouldn't be sold if they were impervious to Chinese authorities. And what we've asked for is a warrant \u2013 when we have a warrant from a court \u2013 that we should be able to get into because cellphones. That's the double standard that has been emerging among American tech companies.</p><p>The CCP has long used public threats of retaliation and barred market access to exert influence. More recently, however, the CCP has also stepped up behind-the-scenes efforts to cultivate and coerce American business executives to further its political objectives \u2014 efforts that are all the more pernicious because they are largely hidden from public view.</p><p>As China\u2019s government loses credibility around the world, the Justice Department has seen more and more PRC officials and their proxies reaching out to corporate leaders and inveighing them to favor policies and actions favored by the Chinese Communist Party. Their objective varies, but their pitch is generally the same: the businessperson has economic interests in China, and there is a suggestion that things will go better (or worse) for them depending on their response to the PRC\u2019s request. Privately pressuring or courting American corporate leaders to promote policies (or U.S politicians) presents a significant threat, because hiding behind American voices allows the Chinese government to elevate its influence campaigns and put a \u201cfriendly face\u201d on pro-regime policies. The legislator or policymaker who hears from these American businessmen is properly more sympathetic to that constituent than to a foreigner. And by masking its participation in our political process, the PRC avoids accountability for its influence efforts and the public outcry that might result, if its lobbying were exposed.</p><p>America\u2019s corporate leaders might not think of themselves as lobbyists. You might think, for example, that cultivating a mutually beneficial relationship is just part of the \u201cguanxi\u201d \u2014 or system of influential social networking \u2014 necessary to do business with the PRC. But you should be alert to how you might be used, and how your efforts on behalf of a foreign company or government could implicate the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA does not prohibit any speech or conduct. But it does require those who are acting as the \u201cagents\u201d of foreign principals to publicly disclose that relationship, and their political or other similar activities, by registering with the Justice Department, allowing the audience to take into account the origin of the speech when evaluating credibility.</p><p>By focusing on American business leaders, of course, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that they are the only targets of Chinese influence operations in the United States. The Chinese Communist Party also seeks to infiltrate, censor, or co-opt American academic and research institutions. For example, dozens of American universities host Chinese government-funded \u201cConfucius Institutes,\u201d which have been accused of pressuring host universities to silence discussion or cancel events on topics considered controversial by Beijing. Universities must stand up for each other; refuse to let the CCP dictate research efforts or suppress diverse voices; support colleagues and students who wish to speak their minds; and consider whether any sacrifice of academic integrity or freedom is worth the price of appeasing the CCP\u2019s demands.</p><p>In a globalized world, American corporations and universities alike may view themselves as global citizens, rather than American institutions. But they should remember that what allowed them to succeed in the first place was the American free enterprise system, the rule of law, and the security afforded by America\u2019s economic, technological, and military strength.</p><p>Globalization does not always point in the direction of greater freedom. A world marching to the beat of Communist China\u2019s drums will not be a hospitable one for institutions that depend on free markets, free trade, or the free exchange of ideas. There was a time American companies understood this and they saw themselves as American and proudly defended American values.</p><p>In World War II, for example, the iconic American company, Disney, made dozens of public information films for the government, including training videos to educate American sailors on navigation tactics. During the war, over 90 percent of Disney employees were devoted to the production of training and public information films. To boost the morale of America\u2019s troops, Disney also designed insignia that appeared on planes, trucks, flight jackets, and other military equipment used by American and Allied forces.</p><p>I suspect Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day. When Disney produced Kundun, the 1997 film about the PRC\u2019s oppression of the Dalai Lama, the CCP objected to the project and pressured Disney to abandon it. Ultimately, Disney decided that it couldn\u2019t let a foreign power dictate whether it would distribute a movie in the United States. But that moment of courage wouldn\u2019t last long. After the CCP banned all Disney films in China, the company lobbied hard to regain access. The CEO apologized for Kundun, calling it a \u201cstupid mistake.\u201d Disney then began courting the PRC to open a $5.5 billion theme park in Shanghai. As part of that deal, Disney agreed to give Chinese government officials a role in management. Of the park\u2019s full-time employees, 300 are active members of the Communist Party. They reportedly display hammer-and-sickle insignia at their desks and attend Party lectures at the facility during business hours.</p><p>Like other American companies, Disney may eventually learn the hard way the cost of compromising its principles. Soon after Disney opened its park in Shanghai, a Chinese-owned theme park popped up a couple hundred miles away featuring characters that, according to news reports, looked suspiciously like Snow White and other Disney trademarks.</p><p>American companies must understand the stakes. The Chinese Communist Party thinks in terms of decades and centuries, while we tend to focus on the next quarter\u2019s earnings report. But if Disney and other American corporations continue to bow to Beijing, they risk undermining both their own future competitiveness and prosperity, as well as the classical liberal order that has allowed them to thrive.</p><p>The Pompeo Statement on the U.S Position on Maritime Claims in the South China Sea</p><p>Secretary of State Pompeo\u2019s statement on the South China Sea was never intended to be part of the four speeches redefining U.S strategy towards China. It came at a time, however, when U.S and Chinese forces were both active in gray area operations designed to assert Chinese authority, on the one hand, and show that the U.S was committed to maintaining its strategic position, on the other. It also came at a time when China has effectively ended most of Hong Kong\u2019s independence, challenged Japan\u2019s position, and created new tensions with Taiwan.</p><p>Accordingly, his statement became a de facto part of the U.S effort to redefine its position relative to China, and its focus on international law and norms again made it clear that the civil dimension was as important as the military one:</p><p>The United States champions a free and open Indo-Pacific. Today we are strengthening U.S policy in a vital, contentious part of that region \u2014 the South China Sea. We are making clear: Beijing\u2019s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them.</p><p>In the South China Sea, we seek to preserve peace and stability, uphold freedom of the seas in a manner consistent with international law, maintain the unimpeded flow of commerce, and oppose any attempt to use coercion or force to settle disputes. We share these deep and abiding interests with our many allies and partners who have long endorsed a rules-based international order.</p><p>These shared interests have come under unprecedented threat from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Beijing uses intimidation to undermine the sovereign rights of Southeast Asian coastal states in the South China Sea, bully them out of offshore resources, assert unilateral dominion, and replace international law with \u201cmight makes right.\u201d Beijing\u2019s approach has been clear for years. In 2010, then-PRC Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi told his ASEAN counterparts that \u201cChina is a big country and other countries are small countries and that is just a fact.\u201d The PRC\u2019s predatory world view has no place in the 21st century.</p><p>The PRC has no legal grounds to unilaterally impose its will on the region. Beijing has offered no coherent legal basis for its \u201cNine-Dashed Line\u201d claim in the South China Sea since formally announcing it in 2009. In a unanimous decision on July 12, 2016, an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention \u2013 to which the PRC is a state party \u2013 rejected the PRC\u2019s maritime claims as having no basis in international law. The Tribunal sided squarely with the Philippines, which brought the arbitration case, on almost all claims.</p><p>As the United States has previously stated, and as specifically provided in the Convention, the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s decision is final and legally binding on both parties. Today we are aligning the U.S position on the PRC\u2019s maritime claims in the SCS with the Tribunal\u2019s decision. Specifically:</p><p>The PRC cannot lawfully assert a maritime claim \u2013 including any Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claims derived from Scarborough Reef and the Spratly Islands \u2013 vis-a-vis the Philippines in areas that the Tribunal found to be in the Philippines\u2019 EEZ or on its continental shelf. Beijing\u2019s harassment of Philippine fisheries and offshore energy development within those areas is unlawful, as are any unilateral PRC actions to exploit those resources. In line with the Tribunal\u2019s legally binding decision, the PRC has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to Mischief Reef or Second Thomas Shoal, both of which fall fully under the Philippines\u2019 sovereign rights and jurisdiction, nor does Beijing have any territorial or maritime claims generated from these features.</p><p>As Beijing has failed to put forth a lawful, coherent maritime claim in the South China Sea, the United States rejects any PRC claim to waters beyond a 12-nautical mile territorial sea derived from islands it claims in the Spratly Islands (without prejudice to other states\u2019 sovereignty claims over such islands). As such, the United States rejects any PRC maritime claim in the waters surrounding Vanguard Bank (off Vietnam), Luconia Shoals (off Malaysia), waters in Brunei\u2019s EEZ, and Natuna Besar (off Indonesia). Any PRC action to harass other states\u2019 fishing or hydrocarbon development in these waters \u2013 or to carry out such activities unilaterally \u2013 is unlawful.</p><p>The PRC has no lawful territorial or maritime claim to (or derived from) James Shoal, an entirely submerged feature only 50 nautical miles from Malaysia and some 1,000 nautical miles from China\u2019s coast. James Shoal is often cited in PRC propaganda as the \u201csouthernmost territory of China.\u201d International law is clear: An underwater feature like James Shoal cannot be claimed by any state and is incapable of generating maritime zones. James Shoal (roughly 20 meters below the surface) is not and never was PRC territory, nor can Beijing assert any lawful maritime rights from it.</p><p>The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire. America stands with our Southeast Asian allies and partners in protecting their sovereign rights to offshore resources, consistent with their rights and obligations under international law. We stand with the international community in defense of freedom of the seas and respect for sovereignty and reject any push to impose \u201cmight makes right\u201d in the South China Sea or the wider region.</p><p>Making Fundamental Changes in U.S and Allied Relations with China</p><p>When Secretary of State Pompeo did give the fourth speech in the series, he used the strongest rhetoric of any of the speakers. He focused on China\u2019s politics and goals, and he issued a broad indictment of its conduct.</p><p>The initial impact of his speech was weakened because it was given on a Friday in California \u2013 at a time when media coverage is not at its peak and when there were so many ongoing crises including other issues relating to China \u2013 that it did not get the attention it deserved. It also is not an easy speech to excerpt. The Secretary delivered it at the Nixon Center in a highly colloquial way which matched his direct audience, but it was relatively informal by the standards normally associated with a major policy speech.</p><p>There was nothing ambiguous, however, about the Secretary\u2019s indictment of China\u2019s government and leadership, both in his speech and in his answer to the questions that followed. He only gave relatively few examples of Chinese conduct, citing the previous speakers, but he unambiguously called for fundamental changes in the way the United States, its allies, and the rest of the world deal with China.</p><p>Next year marks half a century since Dr. Kissinger\u2019s secret mission to China, and the 50th anniversary of President Nixon\u2019s trip isn\u2019t too far away in 2022. The world was much different then. We imagined engagement with China would produce a future with bright promise of comity and cooperation.</p><p>But today \u2013 today we\u2019re all still wearing masks and watching the pandemic\u2019s body count rise because the CCP failed in its promises to the world. We\u2019re reading every morning new headlines of repression in Hong Kong and in Xinjiang. We\u2019re seeing staggering statistics of Chinese trade abuses that cost American jobs and strike enormous blows to the economies all across America, including here in southern California. And we\u2019re watching a Chinese military that grows stronger and stronger, and indeed more menacing.</p><p>I\u2019ll echo the questions ringing in the hearts and minds of Americans from here in California to my home state of Kansas and beyond: What do the American people have to show now 50 years on from engagement with China? Did the theories of our leaders that proposed a Chinese evolution towards freedom and democracy prove to be true? Is this China\u2019s definition of a win-win situation? And indeed, centrally, from the Secretary of State\u2019s perspective, is America safer? Do we have a greater likelihood of peace for ourselves and peace for the generations which will follow us?</p><p>Look, we have to admit a hard truth. We must admit a hard truth that should guide us in the years and decades to come, that if we want to have a free 21st century, and not the Chinese century of which Xi Jinping dreams, the old paradigm of blind engagement with China simply won\u2019t get it done. We must not continue it and we must not return to it.</p><p>As President Trump has made very clear, we need a strategy that protects the American economy, and indeed our way of life. The free world must triumph over this new tyranny.</p><p>\u2026 with that historic trip to Beijing, President Nixon kicked off our engagement strategy. Henobly sought a freer and safer world, and he hoped that the Chinese Communist Party would return that commitment. As time went on, American policymakers increasingly presumed that as China became more prosperous, it would open up, it would become freer at home, and indeed present less of a threat abroad, it\u2019d be friendlier. It all seemed, I am sure, so inevitable.</p><p>But that age of inevitability is over. The kind of engagement we have been pursuing has not brought the kind of change inside of China that President Nixon had hoped to induce\u2026The truth is that our policies \u2013 and those of other free nations \u2013 resurrected China\u2019s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it\u2026.We opened our arms to Chinese citizens, only to see the Chinese Communist Party exploit our free and open society. China sent propagandists into our press conferences, our research centers, our high-schools, our colleges, and even into our PTA meetings.</p><p>We marginalized our friends in Taiwan, which later blossomed into a vigorous democracy\u2026We gave the Chinese Communist Party and the regime itself special economic treatment, only to see the CCP insist on silence over its human rights abuses as the price of admission for Western companies entering China.</p><p>Ambassador O\u2019Brien ticked off a few examples just the other day: Marriott, American Airlines, Delta, United all removed references to Taiwan from their corporate websites, so as not to anger Beijing\u2026.In Hollywood, not too far from here \u2013 the epicenter of American creative freedom, and self-appointed arbiters of social justice \u2013 self-censors even the most mildly unfavorable reference to China\u2026This corporate acquiescence to the CCP happens all over the world, too.</p><p>And how has this corporate fealty worked? Is its flattery rewarded? I\u2019ll give you a quote from the speech that General Barr gave, Attorney General Barr. In a speech last week, he said that \u201cThe ultimate ambition of China\u2019s rulers isn\u2019t to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States.\u201d</p><p>China ripped off our prized intellectual property and trade secrets, causing millions of jobs all across America\u2026It sucked supply chains away from America, and then added a widget made of slave labor\u2026.It made the world\u2019s key waterways less safe for international commerce.</p><p>President Nixon once said he feared he had created a \u201cFrankenstein\u201d by opening the world to the CCP, and here we are\u2026Now, people of good faith can debate why free nations allowed these bad things to happen for all these years. Perhaps we were naive about China\u2019s virulent strain of communism, or triumphalist after our victory in the Cold War, or cravenly capitalist, or hoodwinked by Beijing\u2019s talk of a \u201cpeaceful rise.\u201d</p><p>Whatever the reason \u2013 whatever the reason, today China is increasingly authoritarian at home, and more aggressive in its hostility to freedom everywhere else\u2026And President Trump has said: enough\u2026I don\u2019t think many people on either side of the aisle dispute the facts that I have laid out today. But even now, some are insisting that we preserve the model of dialogue for dialogue\u2019s sake.</p><p>Now, to be clear, we\u2019ll keep on talking. But the conversations are different these days. I traveled to Honolulu now just a few weeks back to meet with Yang Jiechi\u2026It was the same old story \u2013 plenty of words, but literally no offer to change any of the behaviors\u2026Yang\u2019s promises, like so many the CCP made before him, were empty. His expectations, I surmise, were that I\u2019d cave to their demands, because frankly this is what too many prior administrations have done. I didn\u2019t, and President Trump will not either.</p><p>As Ambassador O\u2019Brien explained so well, we have to keep in mind that the CCP regime is a Marxist-Leninist regime. General Secretary Xi Jinping is a true believer in a bankrupt totalitarian ideology\u2026It\u2019s this ideology, it\u2019s this ideology that informs his decades-long desire for global hegemony of Chinese communism. America can no longer ignore the fundamental political and ideological differences between our countries, just as the CCP has never ignored them.</p><p>My experience in the House Intelligence Committee, and then as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and my now two-plus years as America\u2019s Secretary of State have led me to this central understanding: That the only way \u2013 the only way to truly change communist China is to act not on the basis of what Chinese leaders say, but how they behave. And you can see American policy responding to this conclusion. President Reagan said that he dealt with the Soviet Union on the basis of \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d When it comes to the CCP, I say we must distrust and verify. (Applause.)</p><p>We, the freedom-loving nations of the world, must induce China to change, just as President Nixon wanted. We must induce China to change in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing\u2019s actions threaten our people and our prosperity\u2026We must start by changing how our people and our partners perceive the Chinese Communist Party. We have to tell the truth. We can\u2019t treat this incarnation of China as a normal country, just like any other.</p><p>We know that trading with China is not like trading with a normal, law-abiding nation. Beijing threatens international agreements as \u2013 treats international suggestions as \u2013 or agreements as suggestions, as conduits for global dominance\u2026But by insisting on fair terms, as our trade representative did when he secured our phase one trade deal, we can force China to reckon with its intellectual property theft and policies that harmed American workers.</p><p>We know too that doing business with a CCP-backed company is not the same as doing business with, say, a Canadian company. They don\u2019t answer to independent boards, and many of them are state-sponsored and so have no need to pursue profits.</p><p>A good example is Huawei. We stopped pretending Huawei is an innocent telecommunications company that\u2019s just showing up to make sure you can talk to your friends. We\u2019ve called it what it is \u2013 a true national security threat \u2013 and we\u2019ve taken action accordingly.</p><p>We know too that if our companies invest in China, they may wittingly or unwittingly support the Communist Party\u2019s gross human rights violations\u2026Our Departments of Treasury and Commerce have thus sanctioned and blacklisted Chinese leaders and entities that are harming and abusing the most basic rights for people all across the world. Several agencies have worked together on a business advisory to make certain our CEOs are informed of how their supply chains are behaving inside of China.</p><p>We know too, we know too that not all Chinese students and employees are just normal students and workers that are coming here to make a little bit of money and to garner themselves some knowledge. Too many of them come here to steal our intellectual property and to take this back to their country.</p><p>The Department of Justice and other agencies have vigorously pursued punishment for these crimes.</p><p>We know that the People\u2019s Liberation Army is not a normal army, too. Its purpose is to uphold the absolute rule of the Chinese Communist Party elites and expand a Chinese empire, not to protect the Chinese people\u2026And so our Department of Defense has ramped up its efforts, freedom of navigation operations out and throughout the East and South China Seas, and in the Taiwan Strait as well. And we\u2019ve created a Space Force to help deter China from aggression on that final frontier.</p><p>\u2026Just this week, we announced the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston because it was a hub of spying and intellectual property theft. (Applause.)\u2026We reversed, two weeks ago, eight years of cheek-turning with respect to international law in the South China Sea\u2026.We\u2019ve called on China to conform its nuclear capabilities to the strategic realities of our time\u2026And the State Department \u2013 at every level, all across the world \u2013 has engaged with our Chinese counterparts simply to demand fairness and reciprocity.</p><p>But our approach can\u2019t just be about getting tough. That\u2019s unlikely to achieve the outcome that we desire. We must also engage and empower the Chinese people \u2013 a dynamic, freedom-loving people who are completely distinct from the Chinese Communist Party.\u2026I grew up and served my time in the Army during the Cold War. And if there is one thing I learned, communists almost always lie. The biggest lie that they tell is to think that they speak for 1.4 billion people who are surveilled, oppressed, and scared to speak out\u2026Quite the contrary. The CCP fears the Chinese people\u2019s honest opinions more than any foe, and save for losing their own grip on power, they have reason \u2013 no reason to.</p><p>\u2026But changing the CCP\u2019s behavior cannot be the mission of the Chinese people alone. Free nations have to work to defend freedom. It\u2019s the furthest thing from easy\u2026But I have faith we can do it. I have faith because we\u2019ve done it before. We know how this goes.</p><p>\u2026It\u2019s time for free nations to act. Not every nation will approach China in the same way, nor should they. Every nation will have to come to its own understanding of how to protect its own sovereignty, how to protect its own economic prosperity, and how to protect its ideals from the tentacles of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>But I call on every leader of every nation to start by doing what America has done \u2013 to simply insist on reciprocity, to insist on transparency and accountability from the Chinese Communist Party. It\u2019s a cadre of rulers that are far from homogeneous\u2026And these simple and powerful standards will achieve a great deal. For too long we let the CCP set the terms of engagement, but no longer. Free nations must set the tone. We must operate on the same principles.</p><p>We have to draw common lines in the sand that cannot be washed away by the CCP\u2019s bargains or their blandishments. Indeed, this is what the United States did recently when we rejected China\u2019s unlawful claims in the South China Sea once and for all, as we have urged countries to become Clean Countries so that their citizens\u2019 private information doesn\u2019t end up in the hand of the Chinese Communist Party. We did it by setting standards.</p><p>\u2026We cannot repeat the mistakes of these past years. The challenge of China demands exertion, energy from democracies \u2013 those in Europe, those in Africa, those in South America, and especially those in the Indo-Pacific region\u2026And if we don\u2019t act now, ultimately the CCP will erode our freedoms and subvert the rules-based order that our societies have worked so hard to build. If we bend the knee now, our children\u2019s children may be at the mercy of the Chinese Communist Party, whose actions are the primary challenge today in the free world.</p><p>General Secretary Xi is not destined to tyrannize inside and outside of China forever, unless we allow it\u2026Now, this isn\u2019t about containment. Don\u2019t buy that. It\u2019s about a complex new challenge that we\u2019ve never faced before. The USSR was closed off from the free world. Communist China is already within our borders.</p><p>So we can\u2019t face this challenge alone. The United Nations, NATO, the G7 countries, the G20, our combined economic, diplomatic, and military power is surely enough to meet this challenge if we direct it clearly and with great courage.</p><p>Maybe it\u2019s time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies\u2026If the free world doesn\u2019t change \u2013 doesn\u2019t change, communist China will surely change us. There can\u2019t be a return to the past practices because they\u2019re comfortable or because they\u2019re convenient\u2026Securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time, and America is perfectly positioned to lead it because our founding principles give us that opportunity.</p><p>\u2026There are places where we need to work with Russia. Today \u2013 or tomorrow, I guess it is, our teams will be on the ground with the Russians working on a strategic dialogue to hopefully create the next generation of arms control agreements like Reagan did. It\u2019s in our interest, it\u2019s in Russia\u2019s interest. We\u2019ve asked the Chinese to participate. They\u2019ve declined to date. We hope they\u2019ll change their mind.</p><p>It\u2019s these kind of things \u2013 these proliferation issues, these big strategic challenges \u2013 that if we work alongside Russia, I\u2019m convinced we can make the world safer. And so there \u2013 I think there is a place for us to work with the Russians to achieve a more likely outcome of peace not only for the United States but for the world.</p><p>MR HEWITT: President Nixon also put quite a lot of store in personal relationships over many years with individuals. That can lead wrong. President Bush famously misjudged Vladimir Putin and said so afterwards. You have met President Xi often. Is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party someone with whom we can deal on a transparent and reliable basis, in your opinion, based on your personal diplomacy with him?</p><p>\u2026we\u2019ve watched this China walk away from their promises to the world on Hong Kong, we watched their \u2013 General Secretary Xi promised President Obama in the Rose Garden in 2015 that he wouldn\u2019t militarize the South China Sea. And Google the South China Sea and arms; you\u2019ll see another promise broken\u2026So in the end, from my perspective, it\u2019s much more important to watch how leaders behave and how they lead than what it is you think when you have a chance to talk to them on the phone or meet them in person.</p><p>My experience\u2026is the best policy is always true candor, identifying the places that you have a redline, identifying places that you have a real interest, making clear if there\u2019s places where you don\u2019t, and there\u2019s things that you can work on alongside each other.</p><p>I think the real danger comes from misunderstandings and miscommunication and the failure to be honest about the things that matter to you, because others will move into that space and then conflict arises. I think the world is a heck of a lot safer when you have leaders who are prepared to be honest about the things that matter and prepared to talk about the things their nation is prepared to do to secure those interests. And you can reduce risk by these conversations so long as you\u2019re honest about it\u2026So I \u2013 no, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s dangerous. I think it\u2019s just the opposite of that.</p><p>You also said \u2013 and I\u2019m sure the speech will be known as the \u201cdistrust but verify\u201d speech \u2013 when you distrust but verify, that still premises verification is possible. It is still possible to do agreements and to verify them; correct?</p><p>SECRETARY POMPEO: It is, yeah, you can still do it. Each nation\u2019s got to be prepared for a certain amount of intrusiveness connected to that. And it is not in the nature of communist regimes to allow transparency inside of their country. And so it\u2019s been done before. We\u2019ve had \u2013 we had arms control agreements with the Soviet Union that we got verification that was sufficient to ensure that we protected American interests. I believe we can do it again. I hope that we can do this on these \u2013 I mean, the Chinese Communist Party has several hundred nuclear warheads. This is a serious global power. And to the extent we can find common ground, a common set of understandings to reduce risk that there\u2019s ever a really bad day for the world, we ought to do it, and it\u2019s going to require agreement and verification.</p><p>What Comes Next?</p><p>Taken together, these speeches call for a major shift in America\u2019s strategic position relative to the China. While no speaker ever referred to shift from \u201ccompetition\u201d to \u201c confrontation,\u201d and Secretary Pompeo only broadly suggested seeking a major change in American structure of alliances and the international order, they collectively outline what could be the most decisive shift in U.S strategy since Secretary Marshall announced a U.S commitment to confronting the Soviet Union on a global basis in 1947.</p><p>There are, however, five key issues that the United States \u2013 not simply the current Administration \u2013 will now have to address:</p><p>Is this view of China correct, and does it offer the best option for dealing with China in the future? Is this view of China one that has bipartisan support in the U.S and that will endure beyond the coming election? The current U.S national strategy addresses both China and Russia as major competitors, as well as far less serious threats from nations like Iran and North Korea. What is the U.S position on Russia? What changes are required in U.S strategy and to what extent can the U.S create global support for its position? How do does the U.S build domestic and international support for a new approach to China, and show that its stance is valid?</p><p>In each case, it is clear that these speeches raise critical challenges, but they do not provide workable answers to any of these questions.Is this View of China Correct, and Does it Offer the Best Option for Dealing with China in the Future?</p><p>Each of the four core speeches, and the additional speech dealing with the South China Sea, raises valid issues about China\u2019s conduct; approach to economic competition; and use of espionage, gray area methods, and military actions bordering on hybrid warfare. They make strong arguments that the United States needs to make major changes in its relations with China and matching changes in its relations with other states to gain their support.</p><p>The speeches do not, however, take account of the world that China has faced in the centuries since the Opium Wars, or the many other historical reasons for its behavior. It treats China\u2019s motives as being the product of a communist ideology, and it ignores the fact that high levels of state control of China\u2019s politics and economy interact with a mix of state capitalism and private enterprise. It applies U.S standards to international legitimacy and focuses on China\u2019s real human rights abuses without noting the immense progress that has taken place in reducing poverty and improving civil living standards and opportunities.</p><p>The Wray speech, for example, states that,</p><p>Let us be clear, the Chinese Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist organization. The Party General Secretary Xi Jinping sees himself as Josef Stalin\u2019s successor. In fact, as the journalist and former Australian government official John Garnaut has noted, the Chinese Communist Party is the last \u201cruling communist party that never split with Stalin, with the partial exception of North Korea.\u201d Yes, Stalin \u2013 the man whose brutal dictatorship and disastrous policies killed roughly 20 million Russians and others through famine, forced collectivization, executions, and labor camps. As interpreted and practiced by Lenin, Stalin, and Mao, communism is a totalitarian ideology.</p><p>Under communism, individuals are merely a means to be used toward the achievement of the ends of the collective nation state. Thus, individuals can be easily sacrificed for the nation state\u2019s goals. Individuals do not have inherent value under Marxism-Leninism. They exist to serve the state; the state does not exist to serve them.</p><p>This is not a balanced statement of even a Marxist-Leninist ideology, and it ignores the fact that China\u2019s authoritarian character does have real limits or that China\u2019s immense Communist Party is more an instrument of state control than a meaningful ideology. It also ignores the fact that some current Chinese goals \u2013 like its claims to the South China Sea \u2013 originated under Chiang Kai-shek in response to a long history of outside attacks on China, instead of being solely a product if its \u201cCommunist\u201d regime.</p><p>Accordingly, valid as the charges made in these speeches are, their sections on ideology in the four core speeches are particularly weak and fail to describe the current structure of Chinese government, politics, and motives. Far too many of the comments about ideology apply more to the Former Soviet Union than modern China. Somewhat ironically, the DIA report on Chinese Military Power does a better job of describing the structure and character of the Chinese government that these speeches.</p><p>If the U.S is to deal with the issues raised in these speeches, it needs to do a far better job of assessing the structure and nature of the Chinese government and political system, its actions overseas and how other states perceive them, and how the U.S can best compete. The U.S also needs to very carefully assess the best way to change Chinese behavior, whether opportunities still do exist for cooperation in many areas, and how the U.S must change its own behavior to win the support of other states.Is this View of China One that has Bipartisan Support and that Will Endure Beyond the Coming Election?</p><p>Surveys do show deep popular distrust of China in the United States. This is very different, however, from support for the views Secretary Pompeo expressed in terms of U.S policy goals and from agreeing on any practical course of action. Many who do agree with the charge made about China\u2019s conduct will feel that these positions are too strong; discount the ability to negotiate too much; and risk going from competition to open political, economic, and military conflict.</p><p>Any consensus that leads to coherent U.S action in dealing with problems this diverse will have to be built over time on the basis of far more evidence regarding China\u2019s behavior, analysis of how it makes decisions and acts, and assessments on the U.S ability to change China\u2019s behavior rather than the current sentiment that is presented in these speeches. The timing is also awkward because it is so close to an election, the broad political climate is so partisan, and there are so many other immediate crises and issues to address.</p><p>Building serious bipartisan support for a new approach to China probably can only begin after the election if President Trump is reelected or after the new Administration is elected if Biden becomes President. It will require far more planning and research than these speeches indicate have taken place to date, and also far more debate over the course of action the U.S should pursue.The Current U.S National Strategy addresses both China and Russia as Major Competitors. What Should the U.S position Towards Russia Now Be?</p><p>All of these speeches target China without addressing Russia. However, the new U.S national strategy adopted in 2017 made Russia an equal threat to China. The U.S is still debating the extent to which Russia has targeted U.S elections \u2013 and Russia has conducted other disinformation, gray area, and hybrid operations hostile to the United States, as well as begun a major nuclear and missile modernization program.</p><p>The potential importance of this mission was made all too clear after Secretary Pompeo gave his final speech on China. Other statements by a senior Administration official warned that the coming U.S election was being targeted with disinformation campaigns conducted by China, Russia, and Iran. The National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) Director, William Evanina, issued a press release on July 24, 2020, stating that \u201cElection security remains a top priority for the Intelligence Community.\u201d This release is available from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2135-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-100-days-until-election-2020\">https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2135-statement-by-ncsc-director-william-evanina-100-days-until-election-2020</url>). It was relatively short, but it addressed a critical aspect of both Russian and Chinese behavior,</p><p>\u201cToday, we see our adversaries seeking to compromise the private communications of U.S political campaigns, candidates and other political targets. Our adversaries also seek to compromise our election infrastructure, and we continue to monitor malicious cyber actors trying to gain access to U.S state and federal networks, including those responsible for managing elections. However, the diversity of election systems among the states, multiple checks and redundancies in those systems, and post-election auditing all make it extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to broadly disrupt or change vote tallies without detection.</p><p>In addition, foreign nations continue to use influence measures in social and traditional media in an effort to sway U.S voters\u2019 preferences and perspectives, to shift U.S policies, to increase discord and to undermine confidence in our democratic process. The coronavirus pandemic and recent protests, for instance, continue to serve as fodder for foreign influence and disinformation efforts in America.</p><p>At this time, we\u2019re primarily concerned with China, Russia and Iran -- although other nation states and non-state actors could also do harm to our electoral process. Our insights and judgments will evolve as the election season progresses.\u201d</p><p>Russia may fall far short of China as an emerging economic power, but it is still a massive nuclear power and poses a major threat to NATO. Its disinformation campaigns as well as its gray zone and hybrid operations pose an ongoing threat to the U.S and many allies; and its activities in Libya, Syria, and the Ukraine show this threat is both operational and serious. The U.S cannot focus on China at the expense of Russia or other commitments without carefully assessing the consequences and making major revisions to its overall strategy. The timing will also be awkward because the U.S must simultaneously deal with the economic impact of the Coronavirus and formulating the FY2021 budget request.What Changes are Required in U.S Strategy and to What Extent Can the U.S Create Global Support for Its position?</p><p>Identifying major challenges is very different from offering credible ways to deal with them. The speeches summarized in this analysis indict China\u2019s leadership, government, economy and civil sector, and military claims without suggesting any clear strategy for countering the problems they highlight or negotiating some settlement or new relationship with China. They are yet another demonstration of the fact that the U.S government seems incapable on understanding that a real-world strategy requires a practical course of action, an actual plan to implement it, and the resources required to execute it.</p><p>China (and Russia) are not simply a \u201cwhole of government\u201d problem, they need a \u201cwhole of government solution.\u201d It is not clear that the speeches just described clearly recognize the extent to which this really requires planning, resources, and implementation.How Does the U.S Build Support for a New Approach to Dealing with China\u2019s Position, and Show That Its Stance Is Valid?</p><p>One key problem the U.S faces is illustrated by the examples of Chinese conduct in the various speeches. Many have never been given the same level of official attention or visibility before. The U.S, has provided detailed official assessments of Chinese military power, but it has never attempted to establish an adequate open source set of reports and evidence to make the full case for the arguments advanced in each speech. These is no ongoing set of official reports that provide detailed chronologies and evidence to the points about China\u2019s methods of economic competition, information warfare, and other largely civil activities \u2013 particularly as they apply to Chinese (or Russian) actions in all countries that the U.S needs to influence.</p><p>This is a broader problem within the U.S government. The U.S does not attempt to counter malign forms of information warfare by fully and consistently communicating the facts in the many areas where only the government can gather the necessary data. For example, it now no longer provides an annual assessment of statistical patterns in terrorism \u2013 the last issue of its only report on Russian military power was in 2017 \u2013 it fails to properly update the CIA World Factbook, it fails to require its major combatant commands to issue meaningful strategy documents and assessments, it provides almost no real strategy justification for its budget requests, and it has effectively given up its effort to produce a workable assessment of the World Military Expenditures and Arms Transfers (WMEAT).</p><p>There are exceptions like Chinese Military Power, but the U.S does an appallingly bad job of using declassified information to counter the information warfare and disinformation activities of countries like China and Russia. It has steadily cut back on such reporting over the years, relied heavily on topical short-term public affairs efforts, and now needs to develop a whole new stream of reporting.</p><p>Many of the areas involved in assessing China\u2019s methods of competing and actions are ones where there is little open source reporting that is not ideological or highly politicized, and where gross over-classification is the rule rather than the exception. A narrow focus on the cost of reports adds to the problem because they are perhaps the cheapest weapon available. Competing in these areas means credible transparency \u2013 an art form where the U.S is sadly lacking.Transitioning from Competition to Civil-Military Confrontation with China without Having a Clear Strategy or Addressing Russia</p><p>There are two other aspects of these speeches that should be a subject of deep concern if the U.S is to act on its words, and gain international support:</p><p>First, they indict China\u2019s leadership, government, economy and civil sector, and military claims without suggesting any clear strategy for either countering the problems they highlight or negotiating some settlement or new relationship with China.</p><p>Second, the U.S must acknowledge that its approach to China is not isolated to its bilateral relationship, but it is also facing the same problems with Russia and even Iran. Instead, the following considerations are needed when creating a strategy:</p><p>China is expanding its influence efforts to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressuring political figures it views as an opposition to China\u2019s interests, and countering criticism of China. Beijing recognizes its efforts might affect the presidential race. Russia\u2019s persistent objective is to weaken the United States and diminish the U.S global role. Using a range of efforts, including internet trolls and other proxies, Russia continues to spread disinformation in the U.S that is designed to undermine confidence in our democratic process and denigrate what it sees as an anti-Russian \u201cestablishment\u201d in America. Iran seeks to undermine U.S democratic institutions and divide the country in the coming months of the elections. Iran\u2019s efforts center around online influence, such as spreading disinformation on social media and recirculating anti-U.S content.</p><p>In regards to Russia, if one considers Evanina\u2019s statement in the context of the fact there still is no final report on the accuracy of the FBI\u2019s investigation in Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election, reports on Russian nuclear and space warfare developments, or reports on Russia\u2019s role in British and other foreign disinformation campaigns, it is clear that the failure to address Russia is a critical omission. This is particularly true given the fact that the new National Security Strategy that the U.S adopted in 2017, the new National Defense Strategy that the U.S adopted in 2018, and both the defense budget submissions and the annual threat assessments by the Director of National Intelligence from 2012 to the present have all focused on Russia as well as China.</p><p>This is also imperative as Russia is still sustaining the fighting in the Ukraine; putting steady pressure on NATO, particularly in Russia\u2019s border areas; testing anti-satellite systems in space; executing a major nuclear and missile program; developing long-range hypersonic pression strike systems; carrying out gray area and hybrid operations in Syria and Libya; and playing a major role in trying to shape world petroleum prices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS3597740</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HV-6VR1-F0YC-N29K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"17657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

You cannot hire enough people to police that kind of activity,\" he says.</p><p>\"The only thing you can do is watch what is happening, and use artificial intelligence.\"</p><p>Shortly after stepping up to the role from chief financial officer under Khosroshahi, Okerstrom rebranded, including a logo change and ramping up marketing spend. He has also turned the company into one he claims is now \"customer-centric\".</p><p>As part of that goal, Expedia is trying to crack down on \"dynamic pricing\".</p><p>During natural disasters, such as when prices skyrocketed during Florida's floods in October, it has tasked staff with manually policing when such events might cause temporary accommodation prices to skyrocket.</p><p>\"We have to come up with feedback mechanism so we can know what those partners say is true and probably not something we can do with humans alone,\" he says.</p><p>It's a challenge to police a site that might have 95,000 rooms or properties available one day and five million the next. But as well as cracking down on exploitative hotels, Expedia is trying to correct a peculiarly modern holiday phenomenon: the holiday filter bubble.</p><p>When travel aggregators exploded onto to the scene they were praised for cutting out the middleman travel agent and handing the masses an accessible and cheaper alternative to book flights and accommodation.</p><p>But websites that act as a portal to millions of people's holidays have also been accused of creating a feedback loop, leading to a surge in tourism to areas that are now struggling to sustain the footfall.</p><p>\"Over-tourism in Venice, Barcelona and Machu Picchu is an issue,\" Okerstrom says. He believes the technology Expedia owns can manipulate tourism in the future.\u00a0 It is already working with government backed Visit Britain to do just that.</p><p>\"We have such a massive audience, we can drive travel patterns,\" he says.</p><p>\"I think we can absolutely influence [travel]. We don't want Venice or Angkor Wat to be closed down, we want them to be around forever for sustainable travelling and we can steer traffic direct people to other places that are totally amazing,\" he says, wide-eyed.</p><p>Expedia has invested heavily in technology and Okerstrom says it will continue to pour money into advanced technologies it is already working on like voice bookings, eyeball tracking and facial recognition sensors that can detect whether people feel happy or sad when they see an advert.</p><p>It currently offers hotels and rental companies analytics tools that show how and what people are booking and and even can even suggest that a hotel releases a room with almost 100pc accuracy that it will be sold that day.</p><p>But it might want to dedicate time to cooling down its pushy customer-facing technology like the \"one room left\" prompt, as British regulators circle.</p><p>In June the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be taking companies to court if they did not end misleading practices like pressure selling.</p><p>It's something that doesn't seem to worry Mr Okerstrom whose varied CV has afforded him the perspective some self-assured billionaire founders lack.</p><p>He has never been a founder and his vast experience across industries, including a stint in London in wealth management and law, has taught him growth is important but not at all costs.</p><p>\"I believe that big tech needs big leaders,\" he says. \"But big leaders can also be on the board or they can be on the senior executive team.</p><p>\"I heard one of my colleagues say 'when you move up, shut up' and that means you need to listen and synthesise information, or bring in experts. \"That's just good governance. I don't think it comes down to one individual.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-50074584</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TYK-CCG1-JCJY-G3JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 14, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

He is a conservative, and, like many other technologists here, he adheres to the long-standing Silicon Valley belief in a free and open Web, unhindered by government interference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But things changed in the wake of violence in Charlottesville, when one technology company after another shut down or cut off service to right-wing accounts and sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, Torba is part of a growing chorus of right-leaning technologists and leaders who have started to sound more like liberals when they talk about Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Events in Charlottesville and at Google, where an employee was fired for disparaging the company's diversity policies, have pushed them toward an unexpected battle cry: Tell the government to force powerful Internet companies to allow anyone to express themselves on their platforms.</p><p> The issue is beginning to percolate in Washington. And it is expected to take center stage this weekend when right-wing protesters are planning to descend on the liberal heart of the nation's tech sector. The groups are holding rallies in San Francisco on Saturday and near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley on Sunday.</p><p> The Saturday event in San Francisco, organized by Patriot Prayer, a group from Portland, Ore., is billed as a free speech rally, while organizers of the Berkeley gathering are calling it a \"No to Marxism\" march on their Facebook page. </p><p>The leaders for both rallies wrote on Facebook that the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis were not welcome. (They did not respond to requests for comment).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"</emphasis>The tech companies should stop censoring users that they politically disagree with or governments should regulate them as public utilities,\" Torba's spokesman Utsav Sanduja said. Last year, Sanduja and Torba founded Gab.ai, an alternative social network for free speech advocates. \"Imagine if a private corporation owned all the highways and they decided to close them down whenever they feel like it - that is what it's like. You cannot deny people a fundamental staple of the Internet.\"</p><p>The language by the Gab founders and other conservatives mirrors Democrats' long-standing arguments that telecommunications infrastructure should be treated as a public good. But liberals have been more hands-off when it comes to social media and other Silicon Valley-provided services.</p><p>Conservatives have always been an anomaly in Silicon Valley, but they've been particularly vilified since <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>election.</p><p>Many say they purposely hide their political beliefs from colleagues and peers.  </p><p>For instance, after their election night party held in Twitter headquarters near downtown San Francisco, local GOP leaders said they advised victorious attendees to consider removing their red Make America Great Again hats before they went back out on the city's main thoroughfare.</p><p> \"It's like being gay in the 1950s,\" said one prominent conservative technologist who spoke on the condition that he not be named.</p><p>Some in Silicon Valley - who say they do not espouse the talking points of the \"alt-right\" or support the positions of the neo-Nazi organizers of the Charlottesville rally - say they are being roped in with extremists and that their voices have been drowned out. They say that tech giants are becoming the online enforcers of a liberal point of view and the gatekeepers of all political expression, with few checks on their power.</p><p> \"For many on the right, not just the fringe but the mainstream, Silicon Valley just has no credibility when it comes to policing public speech because of the way that 'Big Tech's' internal culture seems to close down private speech - the sense that tech firms are the enemies of free expression if you have a viewpoint that diverges from standard liberal ideology,\" said Steve Hilton, a Fox News host based in Silicon Valley and chief executive of Crowdpac, a political fundraising website.</p><p>Torba, an outspoken Trump supporter who calls himself a Christian conservative, was kicked out of the prominent technology incubator Y-Combinator after calling fellow entrepreneurs in the community \"cucks\" and using the f-word in a heated Facebook discussion about racism after the election. </p><p>Y-Combinator said Torba was harassing fellow entrepreneurs. Torba said he was kicked out for espousing conservative views.</p><p> Like many fellow engineers, Torba has long believed that tech start-ups thrive with as little government regulation as possible. But he started to change his mind, Sanduja said, after the company's app was rejected from Apple's app store in January. In rejecting the app, Apple said Gab had violated its policies by hosting pornographic material, among other reasons.</p><p>Last week, Google also banned Gab from the Google Play Store, citing violations of the company's hate speech policies. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin had become an active user on Gab after a succession of companies refused to service his site. Other controversial right-wing figures, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew \"weev\" Auernheimer, also are on Gab.</p><p> Gab.ai has raised more than a million dollars in contributions since last month, Sanduja said.</p><p> The atmosphere for conservatives became more complex after the Charlottesville protests, in which dozens were injured and one woman was killed after a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car into a crowd of demonstrators.</p><p> In response to the protests, a striking number of technology companies, from Facebook to PayPal to Google to GoDaddy and even OkCupid - blocked or shut down service to alt-right and white supremacist accounts. </p><p>The move reflected a stunning turnabout for the tech industry, which has long been reluctant to police their platforms in this way, even as most have policies prohibiting hate speech.</p><p> Conservatives were already fuming from events two weeks earlier, when James Damore, a Google engineer, was fired by the search giant after publishing a long memo in a corporate chat room in which he protested the company's diversity policies and promoted negative stereotypes about women.</p><p>The calls for more federal oversight of tech giants have made their way to Washington.</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said in recent weeks that he was worried about \"large tech companies putting their thumb on the scales and skewing political and public discourse.\" </p><p>In the days after Charlottesville, alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer made populist calls to regulate tech giants and decried tech monopolies. Former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon reportedly made similar assertions earlier this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, a memo about turning the regulation of Internet companies into a GOP plank recently circulated among operatives in Washington, according to several news reports.</p><p>Democrats have also called for more regulation of Wall Street but until recently have largely taken a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley. Now they, too, are becoming more willing to criticize technology companies. </p><p>Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) recently called for greater scrutiny of Amazon. Sen.

He is a conservative, and, like many other technologists here, he adheres to the long-standing Silicon Valley belief in a free and open Web, unhindered by government interference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But things changed in the wake of violence in Charlottesville, when one technology company after another shut down or cut off service to right-wing accounts and sites.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today, Torba is part of a growing chorus of right-leaning technologists and leaders who have started to sound more like liberals when they talk about Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Apple and Facebook. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Events in Charlottesville and at Google, where an employee was fired for disparaging the company's diversity policies, have pushed them toward an unexpected battle cry: Tell the government to force powerful Internet companies to allow anyone to express themselves on their platforms.</p><p> The issue is beginning to percolate in Washington. And it is expected to take center stage this weekend when right-wing protesters are planning to descend on the liberal heart of the nation's tech sector. The groups are holding rallies in San Francisco on Saturday and near the campus of the University of California at Berkeley on Sunday.</p><p> The Saturday event in San Francisco, organized by Patriot Prayer, a group from Portland, Ore., is billed as a free speech rally, while organizers of the Berkeley gathering are calling it a \"No to Marxism\" march on their Facebook page. </p><p>The leaders for both rallies wrote on Facebook that the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis were not welcome. (They did not respond to requests for comment).</p><p> \" The tech companies should stop censoring users that they politically disagree with or governments should regulate them as public utilities,\" Torba's spokesman Utsav Sanduja said. Last year, Sanduja and Torba founded Gab.ai, an alternative social network for free speech advocates. \"Imagine if a private corporation owned all the highways and they decided to close them down whenever they feel like it - that is what it's like. You cannot deny people a fundamental staple of the Internet.\"</p><p>The language by the Gab founders and other conservatives mirrors Democrats' long-standing arguments that telecommunications infrastructure should be treated as a public good. But liberals have been more hands-off when it comes to social media and other Silicon Valley-provided services.</p><p>Conservatives have always been an anomaly in Silicon Valley, but they've been particularly vilified since <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>election.</p><p>Many say they purposely hide their political beliefs from colleagues and peers.  </p><p>For instance, after their election night party held in Twitter headquarters near downtown San Francisco, local GOP leaders said they advised victorious attendees to consider removing their red Make America Great Again hats before they went back out on the city's main thoroughfare.</p><p> \"It's like being gay in the 1950s,\" said one prominent conservative technologist who spoke on the condition that he not be named.</p><p>Some in Silicon Valley - who say they do not espouse the talking points of the \"alt-right\" or support the positions of the neo-Nazi organizers of the Charlottesville rally - say they are being roped in with extremists and that their voices have been drowned out. They say that tech giants are becoming the online enforcers of a liberal point of view and the gatekeepers of all political expression, with few checks on their power.</p><p> \"For many on the right, not just the fringe but the mainstream, Silicon Valley just has no credibility when it comes to policing public speech because of the way that 'Big Tech's' internal culture seems to close down private speech - the sense that tech firms are the enemies of free expression if you have a viewpoint that diverges from standard liberal ideology,\" said Steve Hilton, a Fox News host based in Silicon Valley and chief executive of Crowdpac, a political fundraising website.</p><p>Torba, an outspoken Trump supporter who calls himself a Christian conservative, was kicked out of the prominent technology incubator Y-Combinator after calling fellow entrepreneurs in the community \"cucks\" and using the f-word in a heated Facebook discussion about racism after the election. </p><p>Y-Combinator said Torba was harassing fellow entrepreneurs. Torba said he was kicked out for espousing conservative views.</p><p> Like many fellow engineers, Torba has long believed that tech start-ups thrive with as little government regulation as possible. But he started to change his mind, Sanduja said, after the company's app was rejected from Apple's app store in January. In rejecting the app, Apple said Gab had violated its policies by hosting pornographic material, among other reasons.</p><p>Last week, Google also banned Gab from the Google Play Store, citing violations of the company's hate speech policies. Neo-Nazi Andrew Anglin had become an active user on Gab after a succession of companies refused to service his site. Other controversial right-wing figures, including Milo Yiannopoulos and Andrew \"weev\" Auernheimer, also are on Gab.</p><p> Gab.ai has raised more than a million dollars in contributions since last month, Sanduja said.</p><p> The atmosphere for conservatives became more complex after the Charlottesville protests, in which dozens were injured and one woman was killed after a Nazi sympathizer plowed his car into a crowd of demonstrators.</p><p> In response to the protests, a striking number of technology companies, from Facebook to PayPal to Google to GoDaddy and even OkCupid - blocked or shut down service to alt-right and white supremacist accounts. </p><p>The move reflected a stunning turnabout for the tech industry, which has long been reluctant to police their platforms in this way, even as most have policies prohibiting hate speech.</p><p> Conservatives were already fuming from events two weeks earlier, when James Damore, a Google engineer, was fired by the search giant after publishing a long memo in a corporate chat room in which he protested the company's diversity policies and promoted negative stereotypes about women.</p><p>The calls for more federal oversight of tech giants have made their way to Washington.</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said in recent weeks that he was worried about \"large tech companies putting their thumb on the scales and skewing political and public discourse.\" </p><p>In the days after Charlottesville, alt-right leaders such as Richard Spencer made populist calls to regulate tech giants and decried tech monopolies. Former White House adviser Stephen K. Bannon reportedly made similar assertions earlier this month.</p><p>Meanwhile, a memo about turning the regulation of Internet companies into a GOP plank recently circulated among operatives in Washington, according to several news reports.</p><p>Democrats have also called for more regulation of Wall Street but until recently have largely taken a hands-off approach to Silicon Valley. Now they, too, are becoming more willing to criticize technology companies. </p><p>Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) recently called for greater scrutiny of Amazon. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has homed in on tech monopolies. Strengthening antitrust enforcement was part of new populist-leaning policy proposals put forth by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).</p><p> All of this means that Silicon Valley, which for so long has enjoyed the support of the public and politicians alike, may have a more fraught path in Washington.</p><p> \"The more that they drift down these lines, the more they will attract political enemies and that will lead to more regulations,\" said Aaron Ginn, the co-founder and president of the Lincoln Network, which seeks to use technology to promote liberty in the public space. </p><p>Ginn does not agree with the calls to regulate tech monopolies.

Mark Warner (D-VA), the Senate intelligence committee's vice chairman, said, 'The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end.' Congress, he said, will have to take action. 'Where we go from here is an open question.' </p><p>More hearings are clearly in the offing, and some kind of regulation is likely to follow. That's the probable future, but what would happen if the government lost its ability to control the tech industry? What if tech fought back? What if our democracy transformed into a technocracy?Facebook, Twitter, and Google (FTG)I'll use FTG as a proxy for content you can find on the public Internet. During 2018 at three different congressional hearings, FTG was variously accused of 'allowing' bad actors to use, and abuse, their platforms.  The proper use of FTG should not have been called into question, because FTG's business model is putting the right message in front of the right person at the right time.  The abuse by bad actors who created fake accounts and deployed bots and trolls is a legitimate area of concern, and everyone knows it must be dealt with.  Then there is the concept of Fake News and the tactical reality of censorship. Like pornography, you might know Fake News when you see it, but well-crafted propaganda rarely identifies itself. Whether human, machine, or a hybrid of both, someone or something has to determine what is acceptable and what is not. Whom would you anoint with that level of power?Damned If You Do, Damned If You Don'tAt least some government legislators believe that FTG has the power to accurately predict voter behavior and, more importantly, has the power to alter the course of elections. This is not an unreasonable thought. FTG is capable of high-level predictive modeling and has the ability to test messaging hypotheses quickly and efficiently. Which raises the question, 'Could Mark Zuckerberg or Jack Dorsey or Larry Page have swung the outcome of the 2016 presidential election to the candidate of his choice?'  I believe that Facebook or Google could have easily put its candidate of choice in the White House. But I also believe that the company's CEO would currently be in jail if either had done so.  But FTG took a different path: it followed the existing laws, which state that because Facebook, Twitter, and Google are 'neutral platforms,' FTG is not required to monitor illegal activity. In other words, it was business as usual, and FTG's reward was congressional hearings. Follow the law and get a subpoena or fix the elections and go to jail - decisions, decisions. Oddly, when asked by Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) whether Facebook was a tech company or a publisher, Zuckerberg answered, 'When people ask us if we're a media company \u2014 or a publisher \u2014 my understanding of what the heart of what they're really getting at is, 'Do we feel responsibility for the content on our platform?' The answer to that, I think, is clearly yes.' But what does he mean by 'we?' Does he mean a set of policies crafted by a diverse group of democratically elected representatives? Or does he mean the royal we, in other words, him?The TransformationJust for fun, let's imagine a world where the US government decides it is going to take big tech out to the woodshed. Congress has a bunch of hearings. Committees and subcommittees are formed and regulations are crafted. In this hypothetical world, FTG is really unhappy with the government getting in its face and the CEOs decide it's time to fight back.  Playing this out, FTG sets out to replace the regulators with elected officials who are sympathetic (or subservient) to FTG's cause. It works because FTG is that powerful. Then the CEOs in traditional 1930s Gangland-style start divvying up the territory. They invite the other bosses (Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, etc.). And poof! In three election cycles, America is transformed from a democracy into a technocracy - and no one (except those on the inside) would even know.The EvolutionIt's possible that a technocratic republic would provide a better quality of life than the current constitutional republic. Turning data into action is what big tech does, and for our country to sustain its position as a world leader, it needs technological mastery as a core competence. A technocracy would be run far more efficiently than our current system, and it would be impossible for politicians to do anything other than what they were told to do for the good of the technocracy. However, this vision of a benevolent dictatorial technocracy is nave in the extreme. Everything might be great for a while, but then the CEOs would start to disagree or get into turf wars or some other conflict, and they would start fighting with each other with weaponized technology. In the end, some working-class hero would raise up an army and reclaim America for Americans - and in the process probably set the clock back to the Stone Age. Fodder for a B-movie script? Nope. It's not good enough.What's NextCongress is looking for a fight. Big Tech is not. The process may end with some mild, uninformed regulations that can be easily dealt with, or it may yield draconian regulations that inhibit innovation and growth, or we might end up with some amped-up privacy laws and some regulations around omni-platform advertising and messaging. Whatever the regulations turn out to be, they will apply to everyone, and every business is capable of adapting to a level playing field. In reality, I am not too worried about government tech regulation.  But what if Big Tech decides to fight back? What would that America look like? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

When a tech company reaches a certain level of success, the names of the founders often become synonymous with the brand they create \u2014 at least, that's the case with founders who are the \"face\" of the company.Still, we tend to forget that Steve Jobs, Travis Kalanick, and Bill Gates didn't create Apple, Uber, and Microsoft alone.On the contrary, these companies might not exist in the same capacity if it weren't for the cofounders who fly under the radar either because they chose to steer clear of the spotlight or because the pressures brought on by the early years of a quickly growing company pushed them away. Many of these same people have moved on to create other multimillion-dollar ideas, while others left for a life of philanthropy, or pursued another passion.Here are the lesser-known cofounders who helped create some of the world's biggest tech companies.Prachi Bhardwaj contributed to an earlier version of this article. </p><p>Steve Wozniak designed and built the first Apple computer, the Apple 1. Steve Wozniak (a.k.a. \"Woz\") doesn't reallyneed an introduction, but for those who aren't well-versed in the history of Apple, Wozniak formed Apple along with Steve Jobs in 1976.Wozniak was working at Hewlett-Packard at the time, where he tried to share his computer design. When he was denied multiple times[2], Steve Jobs \u2014 who was working there for the summer \u2014 suggested the pair try to sell a fully assembled version of the design to a third party.As Apple grew, Wozniak felt the emphasis on marketing hindered him as an engineer, and he left for good in 1985[3], but he's still the sole inventor on multiple Apple patents, including the \"Microcomputer for use with video display[4].\"The same year he left Apple, Wozniak finished earning his degree from UC Berkeley (under the fake name \"Rocky Clark\"[5]) and founded a company that built the first programmable universal remote control.[6]Wozniak has since cofounded two more companies, multiple non-profits[7], including the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and the Silicon Valley Comic Con[8]. He's on multiple company boards, and remains on the official Apple employee list[9]. He's also an Apple shareholder. Ronald Wayne, the third cofounder of Apple, met Jobs and Wozniak while working at Atari. When Jobs and Wozniak formed \"Apple Computer\" in 1976 Ronald Wayne drew up the first logo and the partnership agreement[10] that gave him 10% of the company.But Wayne, who was 42 at the time, only lasted for 12 days[11] before deciding he couldn't keep up with the pace the company was going. Wayne sold his shares for $800 \u2014 a decision he says he doesn't regret[12].Today, Wayne has written two books, holds dozens of patents, and sells gold, rare coins, and stamps from his home in Nevada. He has since auctioned off his Apple archive[13]. Garrett Camp is credited with inventing Uber. Former Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wasn't the one to come up with the original idea for Uber.\"Garrett [Camp] is the guy who invented that s---,\" Kalanick once said[14] at an early Uber event in San Francisco. \"I just want to clap and hug him at the same time.\"Camp described what we know as \"ride-sharing\" to Kalanick when they attended the 2008 LeWeb conference: He wanted to create a convenient luxury car service that didn't cost a thousand dollars to use. Kalanick was on board, and UberCab started later that year[15].The initial prototype was created by Camp. Kalanick was brought on as a \"mega advisor\" and wasn't named CEO until 2010[16], when he replaced then CEO Ryan Graves.Camp earned his first fortune when he sold the web-recommendation tool StumbleUpon to eBay in 2007. He's also an investor, creator of startup studio Expa \u2014 which helps new founders build their own products \u2014 and launched a nonprofit called the Camp Foundation.Camp served on Uber's board[17] until March 2020. He owns about a 4% stake[18] in the company. Twitter had three cofounders: Ev Williams, Noah Glass, and Biz Stone. Jack Dorsey played a huge role in developing Twitter as a product, but he wasn't technically the founder of the company.Twitter spun out from Odeo[19], a podcast company cofounded by Noah Glass and Evan \"Ev\" Williams (an ex-Googler who cofounded Blogger before it was sold to Google).Williams pushed the team to come up with a new idea when iTunes announced the podcasting platform for iPods in 2005, and an idea from Jack Dorsey, an Odeo web designer, caught Glass' attention. Glass worked with Dorsey and a contract developer named Florian Webber to pitch Twitter, and came up with the name (then \"Twttr\"[20]). The other two built the prototype, but the service eventually ran on Glass' laptop, an IBM Thinkpad.Biz Stone, another ex-Googler brought on by Williams, helped the Twitter team out from time to time, and wrote some of the legal documentation[21].The following year, Williams bought all of Odeo \u2014 including Twitter \u2014 from shareholders, changed it to Obvious Corp. (which he says he cofounded with Stone), and allegedly fired Glass. The reason isn't entirely clear, though the most common belief is that Williams and Glass had clashing personalities. (The entire history of Twitter, and the relationship between Glass and Williams, is spelled out in a Business Insider story from 2011[22].)Today, Stone is an angel investor and cofounder of multiple companies. He has invested in both Dorsey's and Williams' other ventures.Williams was briefly Twitter's CEO and still has a stake in the company, but is now the founder and CEO of publishing platform Medium.Not much is publicly known about Glass other than his Twitter profile,[23] which reads, simply, \"I started this.\" Jim McKelvey cofounded Square along with Jack Dorsey. When Square was founded in 2009, the name \"Jack Dorsey\" overshadowed McKelvey's, but both parties were responsible for the popular mobile-payments app.Dorsey had once written software for McKelvey, and after he was ousted as Twitter's CEO, the two happened to reconnect.\"We started Square because Jim McKelvey, our cofounder and my second boss (after my mother!), couldn't accept a credit card for his art,\" Dorsey said about McKelvey in the founders' letter from Square's S-1 filing[24] before the company went public.McKelvey shared his problem with Dorsey, and the two came up with the idea for Square. McKelvey designed the hardware and built the magnetic reader, while Dorsey wrote the software[25].Today, McKelvey sits on the board of directors at Square. Since starting Square, he has founded two other companies: LaunchCode[26] and Invisibly[27], according to his LinkedIn profile[28]. He wrote a book, which came out in March, called \"The Innovation Stack.\" Automaker Tesla had four cofounders: Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, Ian Wright, and JB Straubel. There are two versions of how Tesla got its start: One is that Tesla was actually[29] the 2003 brainchild of Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. The two engineers raised as much as they could without help, but ultimately needed to land a big investor to lead the Series A funding round.Ian Wright \u2014 who was third to join the team followed by JB Straubel \u2014 and Eberhard successfully pitched Tesla to Elon Musk in 2004.In Musk's version of events, both he and the Tesla Motors crew were equally interested in commercializing a tiny electric roadster called the tZero[30]. The company behind the car, AC Propulsion, declined to bring it to market, but did introduce Musk and Tesla Motors. The group decided to team up, which led to the formation of Tesla as we know it today.Either way, Musk led two funding rounds and co-led a third before Tesla's first production vehicle, the Roadster, was finally unveiled in 2006[31]. Both Eberhard and Tarpenning left after Eberhard was demoted from his position as CEO in 2007, and one CEO later, Musk took on the leading role.Eberhard then sued Musk and Tesla[32], claiming libel, slander, and breach of contract. Eberhard alleged that Tesla had wrongfully tried to \"rewrite history\" by taking away his position as the founder. He eventually withdrew the case and part of the resolution[33] was that there would be five official founders of Tesla.Today, Eberhard and Tarpenning have worked together on a number of other electric vehicle projects, including Volkswagen and SF Motors[34]. Wright left a year after joining Tesla, and founded Wrightspeed[35], which develops electric parts for trucks. JB Straubel was still the CTO of Tesla until July 2019.[36] Snap CTO Bobby Murphy founded the company with Evan Spiegel. Bobby Murphy and Evan Spiegel met when they were Kappa Sigma fraternity brothers at Stanford University.Murphy was studying mathematical and computational science and Spiegel was studying product design \u2014 they put their heads together to develop the prototype of an app that would make pictures disappear after they were shared.Murphy worked 18-hour days coding the prototype, and took a day job with the iPad-based register company Revel Systems[37] before Snapchat took off. He remains the CTO of Snap and has written most of the code for today's Snapchat application.Both Snap cofounders have a nearly equal net worth (between $4.6 billion and $4.8 billion as of September 2020, according to Forbes[38]), but Murphy prefers to keep a much lower profile[39]than his counterpart. Snap initially had a third cofounder, Reggie Brown. The Spiegel-Murphy duo was initially a trio, and the forgotten third member \u2014 Reggie Brown \u2014 was reportedly the idea man. In 2013, he took the matter to court.Brown, also a Kappa Sigma brother, approached Spiegel with a concept for an app that sends pictures that disappear shortly after they're shared.Spiegel recruited Murphy because neither he nor Brown had the coding chops. The three of them reportedly had a non-written agreement[40] to share ownership and profit: Spiegel as CEO, Murphy as CTO, and Brown as CMO.Brown came up with \"Picaboo,\" the first name for the app, as well as the logo: a now widely recognizable ghost, who he named \"Ghostface Chillah.\" But monthsafter Snapchat launched in the iTunes Store \u2014 a glimpse at the celebration is pictured above \u2014 Spiegel and Brown reportedly felt that Brown was bringing little else to the table as CMO, and allegedly changed the passwords on the startup's servers and accounts.In 2013, Brown sued[41] his two former friends for breach of contract, and they settled a year later. Snapchat released a statement[42] saying that Brown did come up with the idea, and he was paid $157.5 million, according to Snap's SEC filings for 2014 and 2016. Brown has kept a low profile since.The little that we know about Brown's whereabouts are that he hadn't had a paying job at the time of the lawsuit, and that he graduated with a master's degree in management studies from Duke University in May 2014. Microsoft was founded by two people: Bill Gates and the late Paul Allen. Bill Gates and Paul Allen became friends in high school and founded Microsoft in 1975. Allen came up with the name (originally Micro-Soft, according to a 1995 interview[43] in Fortune), and then sealed the deal for a technology that attracted IBM, resulting in Micro-Soft's take-off.Allen left Microsoft in 1982 when he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma,[44] a cancer that affects the immune system. He had another bout of cancer in 2009, and in 2018, announced that his cancer had returned for the third time[45]. Allen died soon after[46] at age 65.Allen was a philanthropist, donating more than $2 billion[47] during his lifetime. He was also involved in numerous other ventures, including his ownership of the Portland Trail Blazers and Seattle Seahawks and the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Marc Randolph cofounded Netflix along with Reed Hastings. Marc Randolph and Reed Hastings met when Hastings' company Pure Atria, where he was the founder and CEO, acquired the software company where Randolph worked[48]. Hastings appointed Randolph as vice president of corporate marketing, but soon after, Pure Atria was acquired by Rational Software.During the four months while the Rational-Pure Atria acquisition was being finalized, Hastings and Randolph commuted together to and from Pure Atria's offices in Silicon Valley, actively brainstorming ways to leverage trends for a new business idea, according to Randolph's telling of the story[49]. \"And back then, Amazon is crushing it with books. What else can we crush it with?\"After the two mailed a CD to Hastings' home and it was delivered unharmed,Hastings invested money into the business idea and went to Stanford for a year to earn his master's degree, while Randolph took the reins.Randolph was the first CEO of Netflix. He named the company, and designed both the brand and the interface. Hastings was initially going to be an investor and a board member, but when he started coming to the office more often, executives agreed it was time for a change. Randolph ceded the position to him in 1999[50] to turn to product development, because he missed the start-up phase of the company.\"As I look back on what some of the smartest things I ever did at Netflix, I think having [Hastings] come back and be a very, very major part of the company, eventually becoming CEO in my place, was probably the smartest thing I ever did there,\" Randolph said in an interview[51] with Silicon Valley Business Journal.Randolph stayed on the board until 2003[52], a year after the company went public. Since then, he's been a board member and founder of a number of companies, including data analytics company Looker, and a keynote speaker[53]about entrepreneurship and innovation based on his time with Netflix. PayPal was cofounded by multiple people besides Peter Thiel: Max Levchin, Luke Nosek, and Ken Howery. The former employees of PayPal came to be known as the \"PayPal mafia,\" because a number of them went on to found other huge technology companies. But it all started with Peter Thiel.Thiel met Max Levchin when Thiel was giving a lecture at Stanford, according to Conner Forrest's reporting in TechRepublic[54], and the two began working together on a digital wallet. Thiel attended Stanford, and Levchin attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which is where almost all of their recruits came from.Luke Nosek[55] had attended UIUC with Levchin, where the two had worked together on cofounding a media company, and Ken Howery[56] was recruited by Thiel after graduating from Stanford. Thiel, Levchin, and Nosek founded Confinity: a company that made software that could transfer payments between handheld devices in 1998, like PalmPilots and PDAs. Thiel was the CEO, and Levchin was the CTO. Nosek was the VP of marketing, strategy, and business development, and Ken Howery was CFO. The product was called PayPal.In 2000, X.com's founder Elon Musk made the decision to acquire Confinity[57]. He was almost immediately replaced by Peter Thiel as CEO, who changed the name to PayPal, Inc.After PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002, most of the original PayPal mafia moved on.Howery was eBay's director of corporate development, but eventually rejoined Thiel in 2004 to be the VP of private equity at one of Thiel's VC practices, Clarium Capital Management. He then went on to cofound Founders Fund, Thiel's famous VC firm in San Francisco, with Thiel and Nosek. These days, Howery is the US ambassador to Sweden[58].Nosek left Founders Fund in 2017 to start his own investment fund called Gigafund[59], a SpaceX-focused fund.Levchin founded social gaming company Slide in 2004. Google bought it for $182 million in 2010, and Levchin was allowed to run it independently until Google cofounder Larry Page shut it down in 2011. Levchin later founded HVF, which spun out into financial technology company Affirm[60]. He has served as a board member for a number of companies, including Yelp and Evernote. Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, Andrew McCollum, and Eduardo Saverin all helped create Facebook. The five Facebook founders were classmates at Harvard University. Zuckerberg, who was the mastermind behind thefacebook.com, as the site was called at the time, recruited roommates Moskovitz and Hughes, and two other friends to help him develop it.Zuckerberg had known Eduardo Saverin for about a year when he invited him to join. Saverin was Facebook's first investor and took on the business partner role in the relationship during the early stages of Facebook.Moskovitz, keen on helping Zuckerberg expand the site, learned the PHP language in \"a couple of days,\"according to Zuckerberg[61], and became the company's first CTO.Hughes served as the spokesman, beta tester, PR specialist, customer service representative, and everything else user-facing, but he didn't write code or handle any of the business.Zuckerberg knew Andrew McCollum from all of their computer-science classes, and he asked him to design Facebook's first logo[62] \u2014 a face that was actually a sketch of actor Al Pacino. McCollum also worked on Facebook's file-sharing program called Wirehog, which never took off the way Zuckerberg planned.The summer after the site launched in 2004, Zuckerberg, Hughes, and Moskovitz traveled to Palo Alto, California. Zuckerberg and Moskovitz decided to drop out of Harvard and stay to relocate their operations and start hiring employees. Hughes went back when the semester started, but joined them again when he graduated in 2006.While they were in Palo Alto, Zuckerberg pushed Saverin out, anddiluted his shares[63] to 10% because of what Zuckerberg believed to be Saverin's lack of contribution to the company.Saverin eventually sued Facebook over breach of fiduciary duty. He walked away with 4% of the company, and today he lives in Singapore, having renounced his US citizenship[64] in 2011 \u2014 a year before Facebook's IPO, meaning the taxes he had to pay on capital gains were significantly reduced.McCollum left in 2006 is currently the CEO of internet television company Philo[65].Hughes left Facebook in 2007 to volunteer for Barack Obama[66]'s presidential campaign, did non-profit work with Jumo and UNAIDS, and purchased a stake in \"The New Republic\" magazine, which he later sold.In May 2019, Hughes dropped a bombshell by publishing an op-ed in The New York Times [67]that called regulators to break up Facebook in order to protect users and competition.Moskovitz left in 2008 to cofound team management app Asana[68], which recently filed to go public.[69] Mike Krieger was brought on as a cofounder when Instagram was still in its infancy. Kevin Systrom might have been the more public face of Instagram, but Mike Krieger was there when Instagram was still called \"Burbn.\"Krieger, who had been two years behind Systrom at Stanford, had been working on his own app, called Meebo, when Systrom recruited him. Soon after Krieger joined, the pair decided to pivot Burbn[70], eliminating most of the features to focus solely on photo-sharing.In April 2012, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook acquired Instagram[71] for $1 billion. The duo stayed at Facebook until 2018[72], when Systrom and Krieger abruptly announced that they were stepping down as CEO and CTO, respectively, and leaving Instagram altogether.Read the original

Consumers and merchants have flocked online and ...</p><p>By Fady Abdel-Nour, Global Head of M&amp;A and Investments, PayU    Over the course of the last six months, the payments industry has been lauded as one of the most impressive in its agility responding to Covid-19. Consumers and merchants have flocked online and safety has been a significant driver of the move to digital as entire countries discourage the use of cash \u2013 but what of financial and data security?    As digital payments adoption accelerates, there\u2019s no time to waste. The pressure is on for governments and regulators to not only ensure security keeps pace with new consumer demand, but to look ahead and clear the road for future innovation.    Acceleration in digital payments    At , we operate in 20 markets across the globe. Since the start of the pandemic, every single one of these markets has seen a seismic shift in consumer habits. In Poland, for example, the number of new onboarded e-shops was three times higher between March and May than in previous months. And in Colombia, e-commerce activity was 282% higher than pre-lockdown levels. Some merchants across our markets saw year-on-year revenue growth of a staggering 500-1000% during April and May.    New merchants are seeing this potential, moving online to increase their customer base and keep economies ticking. But with great innovation comes corresponding regulations. How can regulators keep up?    Innovation vs. regulation: an incompatible duo?    New ideas and technologies are undeniably critical to ensure services keep up with consumer behaviour. However, for this to happen safely, there needs to be collaboration between our industry\u2019s innovators and regulators. Progress requires us to challenge and expand existing boundaries, holding our shared goal in mind.    Important as this concept is, it is by no means revolutionary. The widely pedalled narrative that innovators and regulators are at loggerheads is, quite frankly, outdated. It is not true that innovation in financial services has to disrupt existing systems and infrastructure. We have already seen countless examples of regulators working with the fintech ecosystem to enable and support innovation.    Across the emerging markets that PayU operates in, innovation initiatives are in place to educate entrepreneurs on the regulatory environment in which they operate. In Brazil, the central bank has established a sandbox, the Laboratory of Financial and Technological Innovation, to help fintech startups work more closely with regulators and government and accelerate the development of their ideas. The aim is to create a more efficient financial system, increase financial inclusion and reduce the cost of credit through better regulation. As the country rolls out Open Banking, acknowledging fintech\u2019s potential to drive better socio-economic inclusion is incredibly encouraging.    It would be remiss of me not to mention The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) here. To date, it has excelled in driving positive change by ensuring new players and services can operate within regulatory constraints. If they are unable to do so, the MAS reviews its framework and, where appropriate, adjusts it to safely progress innovation rather than stifle it. In 2019, for example, it issued five new digital bank licenses. Later in the year, it launched the Sandbox Express to help create a faster option for testing innovative financial services in the market.    The open-minded and collaborative approach of these regulatory models marks the future of financial regulation to me. The world is changing quickly and the parameters that keep us secure have to adapt and morph more than ever before. The job is not simple, but it can boost innovation and build a safe and sustainable financial environment, where pioneers are empowered to set the pace for change.    Consumer demand is only one side of the (digital) coin    The other trend creating complexity for regulators is the move towards embedded finance and Big Tech\u2019s involvement in this.    Fady Abdel-Nour    Broadly, embedded finance means that fintech services are expanding beyond the walls of banks and becoming part of other business models rather than a standalone entity. This is a challenge in itself, as regulators will need to be vigilant to ensure that payments, credit and other financial services remain secure and customers are protected.    Across Europe, the US, Latin America, Asia and Africa, governments have also been grappling with how to regulate Big Tech. Facebook, for example, has launched \u2018Facebook Financial\u2019 to pursue opportunities in digital payments and e-commerce. Similarly, regulators in Brazil and India have been trying to navigate WhatsApp\u2019s attempts to establish its new payments feature in both markets. These features were suspended by Brazil\u2019s central bank and have been in testing in India for over two years.    The good news is that regulators are paying attention. The pushback we\u2019re seeing is not simply aversion to change, but industry experts exploring how these developments can keep consumer needs at the heart and enhance the current payment ecosystem. New business models and new players are important to keeping us all at the top of our game.    Regulating a changing financial ecosystem    We\u2019re in a truly remarkable age, where the role of regulation is being tested again and again. I believe that regulators have a more vital role to play than ever. Covid-19 has been a powerful catalyst in the financial sector and there is some positive change to be harnessed from the disruption.    If navigated shrewdly, regulators will succeed in capitalising on new trends to retain their core purpose: to ensure the safety and security of the customer and support positive change. The whole industry will need to work together closely to build a regulatory framework that is fertile for innovation and allows us to realise the enormous potential of payments in this new decade. So, what are we waiting for?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The lender is still 62pc-owned by the Treasury after a \u00a346bn bailout in 2008. </p><p>Rose has worked at RBS for 27 years, previously serving as deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, the retail and commercial banking division, and running RBS's commercial and private banking business.</p><p>During her tenure, Rose has also fought to improve women's prospects in business, and was tasked by the Government with shedding light on the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs. In response to the The Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship, the Government pledged to increase the number of female entrepreneurs by half to nearly 600,000 women by 2030.</p><p>                       Lucy Burton                   </p><p>                     Mike Manley                   </p><p>The merger of FiatChrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Peugeot-owner PSA Groupe could put Mike Manley, the current chief executive of FCA, in a tricky position.</p><p>Terms of the deal will result in PSA boss Carlos Tavares heading the combined business, while the FCA chairman will take a similar position at the enlarged entity.</p><p>This is likely to make Manley, who took the top job at FCA when Sergio Marchionne stepped down shortly before his death in 2018, superfluous to requirements.</p><p>Although Elkann has said Manley \"will be alongside\" Tavares in the merged business, whether he will remain there is up for debate.</p><p>Highly respected for his organisational and operational abilities, Kent-born Manley-the most senior Briton in the global automotive industry-is seen by many as too powerful a force to be sidelined, and one deserving to head a car maker.</p><p>This could mean he's in the frame for the most prestigious job in the UK automotive industry-heading up JaguarLand Rover. Current chief executive Sir Ralf Speth is 64 and there has been speculation about how long he will remain in the job, having achieved his goal of overseeing the relaunch of the most iconic vehicle in the company's line-up: the new Defender.</p><p>It's by no means certain that Speth will go this year-he's steered JLR through good times and now rather tougher times-but, if he does, Manley could certainly be a potential replacement.</p><p>                       Alan Tovey                   </p><p>                     Margrethe Vestager                   </p><p>The European Union's \"back again\" competition commissioner says she has only just started, striking fear into the heart of Silicon Valley. The Danish politician and digital watchdog has earned a reputation as big tech's worst nightmare, fining Google $9bn for antitrust violations and Apple $14.5bn for tax avoidance.</p><p>And while she was expected to vacate her post in 2019, new European Commission president Ursula von der Layen confirmed Vestager would retain the competition brief and made her more powerful than ever. Vestager now has expanded oversight on the EU's digital policy and has pledged to crack down on some of the tech industry's worse excesses.</p><p>\"In the last five years, some of the darker sides of digital technologies have become visible,\" Ms. Vestager said.</p><p>With her new remit, Vestager is set to introduce the world's first regulations on artificial intelligence and has called for collective bargaining rights for workers in the gig economy-such as Uber's drivers. She will also try to make companies pay more tax in Europe and will continue investigations into alleged unfair business practices by companies such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>But her wishlist will face challenges such as the UK's exit from the EU, fierce opposition from Silicon Valley itself and tetchy relations with the US. President Trump said of Vestager that \"she hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I have ever met\".</p><p>And while big tech will be Vestager's main target in 2020, she will also be looking at wider competition issues, including the recent pledge to curb Chinese state-supported companies snapping up European assets.</p><p>                       Tom Hoggins                   </p><p>                     Trevor Strain                    </p><p>The heir apparent to David Potts to run Morrisons, the UK's third largest grocer. Strain, who spent three decades at rival Tesco before joining Morrisons in 2014, was promoted to chief operating officer in December. </p><p>He has long been tipped to succeed Potts, who previously spent 38 years at Tesco and took the helm at Morrisons in 2015.</p><p>Strain, a West Ham fan, had been finance chief since 2013. He has already had an insight into the top job when he was interim boss before Potts joined. As chief financial officer, Strain helped Morrison's through a troubled period in which the supermarket was under pressure to sell its stores and battle the rise of cheaper European rivals Aldi and Lidl.</p><p>The turnaround under Potts has seen the retailer record three straight years of profit and sales growth.</p><p>In his new role, Strain will take over responsibility for commercial, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, operations development, online and wholesale. This second promotion in nine months is believed to be an attempt to prepare Strain for the top job. </p><p>And although Potts has played down suggestions he will retire, a reshuffle at the top is likely in 2020.</p><p>                       Laura Onita                   </p><p>                     Wendy Tan White                   </p><p>From South Kensington to Silicon Valley, Wendy Tan White is the woman behind Moonfruit (a website building business which she sold for \u00a323m in 2012). </p><p>White is settling into the sunnier climes of Mountain View, California at the highly secretive 'X' headquarters. X is Google parent company Alphabet's moonshot department, responsible for incubating Waymo driverless cars, the \"Everyday Robot\" and internet balloon project Loon.</p><p>White knows how to scale a business and, as X's new vice-president, will be working with high risk ideas and helping steer them to profitable, bona fide businesses in their own right.</p><p>Hopefully her British links will result in some Google cash flowing to researchers and entrepreneurs from the UK, too. </p><p>                       Margi Murphy                   </p><p>                     Bernard Looney                   </p><p>The suave and charismatic Irishman is set to take over from Bob Dudley as chief executive of oil giant BP in the new year, and will become boss at a critical juncture in the company's 100 year history.</p><p>Just a decade on from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in history, and battered more recently by negative public sentiment spurred by the Extinction Rebellion movement, BP must decide now what kind of company it wants to be for the next 50 years.</p><p>Does it want to make money, or does it want to save the planet? Many believe it cannot do both.</p><p>Looney, 49, disagrees.</p><p>While he has yet to set out his agenda for the company, all indications point to a steely focus on addressing the central dilemma faced by all the oil majors: how to transition to an environmentally friendly business without destroying shareholder value.</p><p>Likely to take centre stage at the start of February, Looney will have the platform to announce his vision for the company in detail. What he says will likely shape the fortunes of one of the UK's biggest corporates for potentially decades to come.</p><p>                       Edward Clowes                   </p><p>                     Melinda Roylett                   </p><p>The new UK general manager of Uber was appointed in August amid the controversy of London's ban on the ride-hailing app. A task made all the tougher by TfL's determination to see through the ban that could could remove Uber drivers from the capital's streets in early 2020.</p><p>Uber said that the ban is \"extraordinary and wrong\" and Roylett's main challenge will be to get on the right side of TfL and have the ride-hailing app restored in one of its most popular cities-task that will prove crucial to Uber's business as a whole.</p><p>But Roylett, who joined the Silicon Valley after a stint as head of Europe at payment company Square and ten years at Paypal, also has Uber's other UK pursuits to expand.</p><p>She will be responsible for the ride-hailing app's presence in 40 cities across the UK and Ireland and will be determined to stave off any further regulatory threats, as well as competition from emerging rivals such as Bolt.</p><p>                       Hannah Boland                   </p><p>                     John Malone                   </p><p>The \"Cable Cowboy\" John Malone is the kingmaker in the UK telecoms market in 2020. His cable group Liberty Global, the owner of Virgin Media, has more than $11bn burning a hole in its pocket following the sale of its German business to Vodafone.</p><p>Much of the cash is likely to be returned to Liberty Global shareholders, but most industry watchers also expect Malone to buy a UK mobile operator so that Virgin Media can challenge BT in the emerging market for \"converged\" connectivity packages bundling home broadband with wireless service.</p><p>O2, owned by the Spanish giant Telefonica, is viewed as the most likely candidate. The main question is how Malone, a fan of complex financial engineering, could structure a deal using Virgin Media's valuable tax losses-or even with a stock market listing that could allow the 78-year-old Colorado billionaire to continue what has been a gradual withdrawal from European telecoms.</p><p>Virgin Media, which is on track to lose its longstanding network advantage as the Government encourages new rival full-fibre infrastructure, is also wooing Sky for a potential broadband wholesale deal that could deliver a heavy blow to BT's Openreach network arm.</p><p>Malone has never been one to let his yearnings get ahead of his earnings, but his decisions this year are crucial to Britain's connected future.</p><p>                       Christopher Williams                   </p><p>                     Brian Chesky                   </p><p>AirBnB's chief executive has gone from renting out his apartment and blow-up mattresses to the cusp of one of the world's hottest business floats.</p><p>The wildly successful property start-up provides cheap accommodation by letting anyone rent out their spare room and, after its relatively low-key beginnings in San Francisco, is now active in cities across the globe, and is reporting revenues north of $2bn.</p><p>Chesky announced plans for AirBnB to go public in September, with the 38-year-old New Yorker looking to break the trend of WeWork-style calamitous listings. Chesky is worth a reported $4.2bn himself, with AirBnB looks set to command a huge valuation in 2020.</p><p>But despite its success, the company is still walking a tightrope, with regulatory concerns over unscrupulous landlords taking advantage of AirBnB's platform to essentially run unregulated hotels. If local authorities begin to crack down on this behaviour, AirBnB's seemingly healthy business could look more questionable. How Chesky balances the concerns will be one of the more compelling storylines of 2020.</p><p>                       Tom Hoggins                   </p><p>                     The mystery members of Facebook's new supreme court                   </p><p>We do not know their names. We do not know their faces. All we know is that there will be at least 20 of them - and that in 2020 they will begin deciding some of the internet's most controversial free speech cases.</p><p>These are the yet-to-be-appointed members of Facebook's new Oversight board, which will soon begin operating as an independent court of appeal for its 2.4bn users.</p><p>The board is intended to take pressure off Facebook itself, but it will likely draw down intense scrutiny upon the judges' backgrounds, biases and arguments, and the company is concerned enough about their safety that it is drawing up a special security plan.</p><p>One thing is certain: they can't please everyone.</p><p>                       Laurence Dodds                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59052911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW3-R911-F021-640S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2137\"/><timeReceived>2:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 31, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

While simplification of hard-to-read policies is nice, Googleattracted criticism because it will now combine user data across all of its services, including search, Gmail, YouTube, Google+, and GoogleDocs. First the U.S. Congress voiced concerns about the changes, and on Friday, European regulators jumped into the privacy dog pile.</p><p>Googleisn't the only big tech company being scrutinized. Facebook, which controls (and sells) an incredible amount of data people voluntarily submit, has also attracted the eye of the regulators in the U.S. and abroad. In a huge November settlement with the social media company, the Federal Trade Comission found Facebook's privacy practices from 2009 to be deceptive and in violation of federal law. In 2009, Facebookset friends lists, photos, and other info to a default publicly visible setting, even if the person had already designated that info for friends only. The company has since hired two privacy officers and given more notice to users when changes are happening, as it did with the Timeline feature.</p><p>Keeping track of all these privacy issues can be challenging, but this infographic by Frugal Dad outlines some of the biggest privacy problems that have come up in the past few years. More importantly, the infographic also outlines some important ways to protect yourself online, including changing passwords frequently, using more caution with public computers, and turning on cookie notices.</p><p>Take a look at the full infographic:</p><p>Filed under: security</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-VNTR10798813285497065993071300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VNTR-6695</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54X1-76J1-JBF5-T081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"309\"/><timeReceived>10:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 VentureBeat</copyright><publicationName>VentureBeat</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>February 6, 2012 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Four GOP senators currently disprove of the  effort.  It does not look like he has the votes there.  Shocking video out  of California to show you.  The details after a balloon causes a massive  explosion and power outage.  And new trouble for Chipotle this morning.   The company forced to close a restaurant in Virginia after several  customers felt severely ill.  The fallout ahead as the stock continues to  trade down.  Morgan Stanley, the name to watch this morning on Wall Street.   The bank reported second quarter earnings that were above expectations.   The stock is up better than two percent.  Morgan is also racing its  quarterly dividend this morning by 25 percent.  </p><p>Take a look futures this morning and we are looking at a mixed opening for  the broader average.  The Dow is down largely due to IBM.  IBM dragging on  the Dow after reporting another decline in quarterly revenue.  Earnings are  better than expected but revenue is below estimates.  Once again, IBM stock  is lower.  The NASDAQ is up, that's up about 10 points.  So we will see  some winners today.  In Europe stocks are searching for direction.  Take a  look at the Eurozone indices this morning and you see strength across the  board but just fractionally so.  The FT 100 and the CAC quarante up a  quarter of a percent a piece.  In Asia overnight, markets closed higher  with the best performer.  In China, the Shanghai Composite up one and a  third percent.  </p><p>All those stories coming this morning and joining me to talk all about it,  Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global  Economic Editor Jon Hilsenrath, and Fox News Contributor and republican  strategist, Mercedes Schlapp.  Great show everybody.  </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  My pleasure.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be  here.  </p><p>MANSELL:  We want to get in to tax reform today.  That's where the focus  seems to want to go after health care.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  End of the year, it's the homestretch they - that's  where the victory is going to come from for republicans.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  I hope you're right.  I'm hoping that they can move on the tax  reform and see if they can push this through but there's still open  questions on border-adjustment tax and how they're going to pay for it,  it's going to be a revenue neutral bill or is it not? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about that right now.  Joining the conversation  momentarily is House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady in the  studio with us this morning.  Also with us is International Brotherhood of  Teamsters president, James Hoffa who is very vocal saying he did not want  to see that health care bill come to fruition.  Also joining us, George  Senator David Perdue is here, and the host of Varney &amp; Company, Stuart  Varney will weigh in.  As well, you don't want to miss a moment of it, so  do stay with us.  Big hour coming up.  </p><p>Our top story right now this hour, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  says a vote to is to foresee with the GOP's health care bill will be held  early next week.  This as the administration shifts its focus to tax  reform.  Blake Burman is at the White House this morning with all the  latest.  Blake, good morning to you.  </p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Hi there, Maria.  Dood  morning to you as a well.  And that vote that you just referenced next week  is not expected to lead to any sort of breakthrough.  Here is the reality  right now for senate republicans here in Washington.  They do not have the  votes to repeal Obamacare now and replace it a couple years down the line.   They also do not have the votes as it stands at this moment to repeal and  replace Obamacare now.  So yesterday, here at the White House, President  Trump suggested that the next best path going forward just might be to let  Obamacare implode.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think we're probably in that position where we just let Obamacare  fail, we're not going to own it.  I'm not going own it.  I can tell you the  republicans are not going to own it.  We'll let Obamacare fail and then the  democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say, how do we fix  it?  How do we fix it?  Or, how do we come up with a new plan?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN:  The administration though is not yet conceding that health care  reform is dead.  Vice President Pence implored yesterday that, \"Inaction is  not an option.\"  The plan all along, Maria, as you know has been to repeal  Obamacare, to allow for the largest tax cuts possible and the vice  president yesterday continued to outline some pretty lofty expectations.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're going to cut taxes  across the board for working families, small businesses, and family farms.   We're going to simplify the tax code by cutting seven brackets down to  three.  We'll eliminate the alternative minimum tax, we'll make the code  flatter and fairer and simpler for everyone.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BURMAN:  The vice president, Maria, also reiterated yesterday that they  want a business tax rate of 15 percent, but here is where everything stands  out this moment here in Washington.  Right now, health care reform is mired  in neutral, the budget resolution which could lead to reconciliation that  republicans want to use for tax reform even that resolution, Maria, is  facing some pushback from conservatives already in the house.  Maria, back  to you.  </p><p>BARITROMO:  All right, Blake.  Thank you so much.  Blake Burman is at the  White House.  I want to bring in House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman  and Texas Congressman, Kevin Brady is with us right now.  Congressman, it's  good to see you.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  Thank  you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  So, let's talk about where  you begin now.  How critical is the passage of tax reform following the  latest setback on the health care overhaul?  We're going to get to the  budget first but this is incredibly critical.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So the sure answer is even more critical than ever.  Look, we  got to get this gone going in a big way.  This is a major - we're  continuing to see companies move offshore, we're just not seeing the  economic growth.  There are so many young people have no opportunities when  they leave school.  And so, we have to deliver on this and obviously with - - there is no way to spin in a good way what happened in the senate this  week.  It doesn't make it easier but I'll tell you what, we're on pace to  deliver in 2017.  Getting distracted isn't an option for us.  In fact,  we've run this parallel to second track on tax reform nearly since the day  after President Trump was elected.  So -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I know you've been having meetings side-by-side as you've  been affording health care but how are you going to do it, Congressman?  I  mean, let's face it, looks what you're up against here.  You don't have any  democratic support, you've got real divisions within the republican party.   First, you've got to get through the budget, so tell me what's going on  today in terms of budget reconciliation to give you that green white  towards tax reform?</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So today is really important because the budget committee led  by Chairwoman Diane Black who's doing a remarkable job, gives it - the  passage today in the committee, gives us the green light, vehicle to  deliver tax reform.  This year, the president's desk is critical, this is  not a normal budget because this is in effect the tax reform budget and  really important, so today matters.  </p><p>BARITROMO:  All right.  Today matters.  What are you going to do in terms  of all of the divisions?  We saw the divisions in health care and we know  that there's still debate within the tax conversation, border-adjustment  tax, deductions, what stays, what goes away.  Are you still married to the  border-adjustment tax?  </p><p>BRADY:  So I'm married to solving the problem of stopping companies from  moving offshore and more importantly trading right incentives for bringing  those supply chains helm and that's where the White House and the  republicans all.  We are all focused on solving that problem.  At the end  of the day, whether border-adjustment is part that solution or whether it  set aside for future study and we - and agreed on alternative, we're going  to solve that problem of offshoring in a positive way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, do you need revenue in a tax reform package?  Do you need  some form of revenue whether it's border-adjustment tax or something else,  maybe a higher corporate tax rate than we're talking about?</p><p>BRADY:  Well, so we want to make this permanent.  We really think we're  going for the long game here.  Make sure the decisions business is makes to  reinvest in the U.S. are certain for them and so that requires us to  balance within the budget over 10 years.  We can do that but we got to make  some serious trade-offs or at least we have to be creative as we're  thinking about how we lower the rates.  So, we've got to all of that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the trade-offs, Congressman?  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, you just got to look at where the revenue comes from in the  tax code.  And bottom line is, we have to ask you ourselves a basic  question, for us to become competitive again, to leapfrog back into lead  worldwide so companies can compete and win anywhere in the world including  here at home, we need the permanence in the lowest rates possible.  And  that means we have to think about jettisoning specific provisions to  benefit some, so we can lower the rates to become competitive for all and  that's always the challenge in tax reform.  In final point, all these  debates, whether it's border-adjustment or interest, these are healthy  debates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>BRADY:  This is exactly what we ought to be having in this discussion.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They were all healthy debates, it was healthy debates on health  care as well.  What do you do for Medicaid, what do you o do for big  governments?  I get that.  </p><p>BRADY:  So I think the difference here in lessons learn from health care is  the fact that president agreed to work with the house and senate on a  unified, a single tax reform plan and then put it put into work President  Trump, in his team, we're putting the work right now on this.  I think this  is time well spent and increases our chance for success issue.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's educate our viewers on exactly what you're looking for  from them in in terms of their individual rates because a moment ago you  said to me, look, when you talk about the trade-offs, you have to yourself  where does the revenue come from.  It isn't sure that much of the revenue  is coming from individual tax rates. </p><p>BRADY:  Well, on the business -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You want to lower them. </p><p>BRADY:  So, on the individual side, clearly, we are proposing the simpler  fair system, somewhat, so nine out of ten Americans will be able to file  using postcards system.  So we're asking that question, how fair and how  low do you want your rates to go?  On the business side, really I think  there is broad agreement, broaden the base, lower the rate, become far more  competitive than we are today.  And the work that we're doing with the  White House and senate, I'll just tell you this, I really like the pace and  substance of what we're discussing right now.  I think this time both the  tax teams and the principals in the White House and senate, these are  exactly discussions you want us to be having to come to unified plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the individual tax rates, you'd like it to be three  brackets?  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  If possible I think that's --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are the rates that you - that you would favor?</p><p>BRADY:  So we proposed a 12, 25, and 33 rate in the house blueprint.  The  Trump team in original tax plan, very close to that.  And so we started  with very solid common ground on the individual rate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But now there is discussion that - look, it looks bad if you  cut rates on the rich.  That maybe you lose 39.6 percent where it is which  is the current top rate in terms of individual tax.  Your thoughts.  </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  I'm not one of those guys.  I think we need to go for growth,  that's what we want in this tax code up and down the line and lowering  rates for Americans regardless of where they're at is pro-growth,  encouraging more savings investment for Americans is awfully pro-growth,  and the business side as well.  We do this right, I think we unlock the  economy in a major way. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  On the he corporate side, President Trump has talked about a 15  percent rate, there's no way you're going to get a 15 percent rate isn't  that right?</p><p>BRADY:  So, this goes as low as we can go.  I mean, that's our goal.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  20, 22 percent?  </p><p>BRADY:  Well, look, we proposed 20 in the house blueprint, that's our goal,  continues to be our goal in this - in this discussion. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because there's some businesspeople who say, look, going from  35 to 25 is going to be a yawn, it's just not going to move the needle very  much.  </p><p>BRADY:  We are not doing tax reform so we can leapfrog to the middle.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>BRADY:  So that we can leapfrog to be merely average.  There is no reason  to do this, so we still the bolder we go on the rates and how we unlock  that business investment to expensing we think is really critical.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  There is a lot of debate in terms of the deductions, so what  are sacred cows in your view?  I mean, you've said that you would favor  keeping the charitable deduction in place, is that right? </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So I will think -</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What else?</p><p>BRADY:  On the postcard, we're proposing keeping no mortgage deductions and  charitable deduction.  It was cultural type of incentives and we're looking  -- taking a fresh look at how we can incentivize more charitable giving for  example across the income spectrum.  We keep the child tax credit and the  college credit.  In fact we're redesigning that, so we can encourage more  use of it for technical schools.  Welding, plumbing, all those skills we  really need in America and we keep the credit to help you keep people from  welfare to work.  We think those are critical elements of the postcard but  we're also listening, we're listening to lawmakers, we're listening to  stakeholders on what exactly they want on that postcard and still keeping  the rates low.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what happens when you're up against, say Congressman Peter  King who will say, I am not going to buy into anything that eliminates the  deduction for property.  My constituents are paying $30,000 in property  taxes every year.  $40,000, something like that.  I mean, how are you going  to negotiate when you've got a sacred cows elsewhere that you want to get  rid of and there are some of your colleagues on the right who say, I can't  - I can't vote a for that. </p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So there is no question.  We can keep this status quo.  We  can keep New York's tax rates effectively over 44 percent and keep state  and local sales tax deductions, that's not a problem.  Or we can lower  those rates substantially and let all Americans including New Yorkers pay  their local -- state and local taxes but have a net tax cut as we do it.   And I think at the end of the day, people are going to opt for lower rates  far simpler code and everyone just sort of use the dollars, the savings to  get to their priorities. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If you don't get health care done, I mean we're talking about  another vote next week which people are saying you don't have the votes to  actually do the repeal next week.  If health care does not get done, what  do you end up doing?  Do you just cut taxes or what? </p><p>BRADY:  So from -- look, I think it's incredibly important for the senate  individual republicans to stay at table until they solve this problem.  In  my district, Obamacare is collapsing.  You know, this really isn't an  option to do nothing.  So I hope they continue to do it but from tax  standpoint, look, I want those taxes -- health care, taxes on the economy.   If that doesn't happen, we're moving forwarding anyway regardless on tax  reform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Real quick.  When do you expect we will actually see the bread  and butter here in terms of tax reform?</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  So, I think Fall is the timetable for delivering in 2017.   You know, I've gotten away from specific dates on this stuff.  Let's get  the policy right, let's deliver this year.  We still have some work to do,  obviously in all this -- in the tax discussions but again, I think people  are going to like the boldness and permanence of this plan.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you get any support - any participation from democrats?</p><p>BRADY:  We do.  We're having discussions with, house democrats and centrist  democrats about tax reform.  We welcome their ideas.  Look, their economies  are struggling too. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mr. Chairman, thank you so much for walking us through it. </p><p>BRADY:  Thank, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We know we'll have some time with you in the month of August --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BRADY:  Yes.  Looking forward to that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chairman Brady.  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARITROMO:  Welcome back.  Chipotle giving another food scare, Lea  Gabrielle in New York with the story.  Lea?</p><p>LEA GABRILLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Maria.  Well, people do love  those options they can get at Chipotle but now they're getting sick.  The  company temporary closed a restaurant on Sterling, Virginia on Monday after  several people reported getting sick there.  Chipotle blames an outbreak of  Norovirus which the company says did not come from its food supply adding  that (INAUDIBLE) of the chain.  Chipotle was of course hit by a number of  food safety issues two years ago  which is caused it failed and stock to  plunge and in fact, shares of Chipotle fell more than 4 percent yesterday  and they are remaining under pressure this morning in premarket trading.</p><p>Well, check this out.  A dramatic image caught on camera, look at that, a  Mylar balloon making contact with the power line.  That's what happened,  that happened right there in Long Beach, California triggering an intense  explosion between two homes.  Well, the blast caused a power outage in the  area for hours.  Officials of course have long warned to the public about  the danger Mylar balloons pose to power lines and now you can see exactly  what happened.  </p><p>Well, two television networks are in merger talks.  They are Discovery and  Scripps and they're discussing a deal that would put Animal Planet and Food  Network under one roof.  Well, the two media companies are trying to chart  a course in cable -- in the cable T.V. industry which is just being - being  caught upside down really by digital consumption.  So terms of the deal are  unknown.  Discovery is worth 15 billion and Scripps has a nine-billion  market valuation.  The companies have talked about merging since 2014.</p><p>And Morgan Stanley's latest quarterly results coming in better-than- expected.  Boosted by strength in its investment banking and its wealth  management businesses.  And they also raised its quarterly dividend to 25  cents a share.  The stock is higher ahead of the opening bell.  Maria?</p><p>BARITROMO:  All right, Lea.  Thank you so much.  The stock up three  percent, of course, IBM is down and that's weighing on the markets a bit.   We'll take a break.  When we come back, putting American workers first.   The Trump administration in middle of renegotiating the North American Free  Trade Agreement.  Labor Leader James Hoffa will join me with what he wants  to see from the NAFTA deal.  And IBM reports declining revenue for the 21st quarter in a row.  Disappointing sales chipping away confidence in the  technology giant.  Stock is down almost three percent right now.  What  weighed down the company's results?  We'll check it out after this break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARITROMO:  Welcome back.  We are coming to you live from our nation's  capital this morning, talking about jobs, trade, the American worker.  On  that front, the administration says, reducing trade deficit is the top  priority for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement also  known as NAFTA with Canada and Mexico.  U.S. Trade Representative Robert  Lighthizer says, an updated agreement will also include a digital economy  chapter and fold in labor and environmental obligations.  Joining me right  now in an exclusive interview to weigh in is the president of the  International Brotherhood of Teamsters, James Hoffa.  Great to see you,  James.  </p><p>JAMES HOFFA, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS:  Great to  see you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  So what do you  want to see - what's most important to see in this redo of NAFTA from your  standpoint?  </p><p>HOFFA:  Well, I talked to the ambassador yesterday and we talked about what  the priorities are and we watch over a million jobs have gone there.  We've  got to start getting those jobs back, we've got to have a fair trade  agreement, we've got to have one that has content with regard to  automobiles built there.  We want to have more jobs back here.  We started  that process, the president started out.  Remember when he talked about  Ford motor?  They basically canned a two-billion-dollar operation and  brought it back here.  We need more of that to basically reenergize the  economy and get those million jobs back.  But more than that, we've got to  basically have a NAFTA that's fair, that basically controls Mexican trucks  that are coming into our country, that are unsafe.  We've got to have one  that has a good resolution process, that's fair, that doesn't happen right  now.  So there is a lot to do here and the ambassador is very excited about  getting there and we're going to be working with him and we think we're off  to a great start.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  One of the issues with NAFTA was that once that deal happened,  it became OK for a company to say, oh, I'm going to go build in Mexico and  have all of this cheap labor and I'm just going to sell back to the U.S.   And deal after deal to sort of -- that was the template.  Isn't that right?  </p><p>HOFFA:  Absolutely right.  We were not sold that.  Did anybody when they -  when NAFTA happened in the 90s with Clinton, did anybody think that all  these corporations were going to move across the border and basically lay  off Americans?  Did anybody think that?  No.  We weren't sold that and  that's exactly what's happened here.  I can go through 100 companies, every  union can go through a hundred companies that have closed, move down there,  Mr. Coffee, Square D, closer plants, move down there, laid off the  Americans, make the same product, bring it back here.  That's not what this  was about.  We've got to change that, make it fair, and I think we're off  to a good start and I'm looking forward to working with the ambassador.   Make it fair but also this stuff is expensive.  How do you do it without  fuss in the debt?  I want to turn to health care in talking about what's  important for American workers.  The International Brotherhood of Teamsters  sent this letter to - from yourself and Ken Hall saying that you were  against the better care reconciliation act of 2017.  What was your biggest  problem with it?  </p><p>HOFFA:  Well, the problem is it's dead right now.  I mean, they tried to do  it, the republicans tried to do it with 52 people in the senate, they  didn't - they didn't make it.  And they're going to have to start reaching  out to the other side.  I think, you know, what happened with Obamacare is  a good example what's going to happen with the budget, what's going to  happen with everything.  They can't do it by themselves, they don't control  their 52 people with Merekowski and Collins and other people.  So they're  going to have to have a different approach to the budget, they're going to  have to have a different approach to health care.  Health care is dead  right now, I mean, we're going to have Obamacare, that's going to be the  law of the land, that's not changing, that -- the way it is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think it will implode?  </p><p>HOFFA:  No.  Well, if they keep trying to kill it, it will.  I mean, you  can kill anything. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, even - putting the republicans aside, I mean, you  don't have any choice right now, you haven't had choice in a while, you got  these big insurance companies saying, I'm out of here, I lost a billion  dollars on Obamacare.  So it is imploding regardless of what's going in the  republic.  </p><p>HOFFA:  I think the problem is they have to reach - you have to be serious  about saving it.  They have to get with the - with the democrats to figure  out how we fix it, but they need more money.  You can't keep on standing on  the air hose and basically think people are going to survive and that's  what's happening.  They're saying, we want it to die, we're going to cut  money off and that's what's going on with these companies.  You got to make  an incentive to do it.  There's going to be more money to take care of the  most vulnerable people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Did the ambassador respond in terms of what you were looking  for NAFTA? </p><p>HOFFA:  He did.  He talked about it and we're, you know, focusing on  workers, focusing on the problems and we have so many problems in the  Teamsters which other trucks coming in here.  But we also talked about  basically fairness, he's got some good ideas and we're going to sit down  with him with other labor leaders, we serve on ACPEN, a number of  committees that work with the ambassador on NAFTA.  So we're excited about  what we're doing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sounds like you've had a voice.  The Teamsters have had a  voice in some of these policy plans.  How is President Trump doing so far  with his promise to create jobs in America and help workers like the  Teamsters? </p><p>HOFFA:  Absolutely.  He ran as a populist.  He's got to stay on that  message.  He can't get diverted and all the things going on in diverting  him.  He talked about, you know, getting on a TPP.  He talked to about  pipeline, he did that.  He talked about carrier insurance, keeping those  jobs in America.  People want that.  He's got to get back on that message  and don't get hijacked on others things about - other things that he is  doing that are distracting him whether into Russia or whatever.  You got to  get back on the focus there and that's going to be the focus with the  budget and things that are going to be coming out in the next couple of  months. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, you know, the media is all over the Russia story,  the left is trying to obstruct.  What are your thoughts about how the  democrats are basically saying, no, we don't want this agenda executed.   We're going to put as much noise as possible in the room so that they  agenda does not get executed. </p><p>HOFFA:  Well, they're not doing that with regard to - with regard to jobs,  we're doing it with regard to some of the ideas, you know, tax cuts for the  rich, that's the problem.  That's not going to work. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying tax reform is all about tax cuts for the rich? </p><p>HOFFA:  That's what it' about.  Right.  That's what it's about. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.  Give me a break.</p><p>HOFFA:  That's what it's about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're taking - we just heard from Kevin Brady.  He said,  three brackets that he wants. </p><p>HOFFA:  You know, did you know that General Electric is embowing. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- They're taking rates all the way down you for individuals.</p><p>HOFFA:  Didn't pay any taxes, did you know that? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm sorry?</p><p>HOFFA:  They didn't pay any taxes.  Some of these big corporations, this  billion-dollar corporation are not paying taxes. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of all the deductions, that's another thing he want to  do, to get rid of all the deductions so that it's clean slate. </p><p>HOFFA:  We've got to close up all these - got to close these loopholes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And that's what he's saying he's going to do.  So  you're happy with the tax reform package on the docket now or you think it  cuts for the rich? </p><p>HOFFA:  Well, it's tax cuts for the rich right now.  40 percent of the tax  cuts go to one percent.  We've got to have that, that's not fair to America  right now.  We've got to make America strong right now and we've got to  basically have programs that train people, we can't attack Social Security  disability, that's one of the things to attack.  They're attacking student  loans, they're attacking things that make America strong. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Social Security is going to go broke 20 years. </p><p>HOFFA:  And we need - we got to build America not, cut it down. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  These programs, James, I mean, Social Security, Medicaid,  they're going to go broke in 10 to 20 years.</p><p>HOFFA:  They're not going to go broke if you give them money. I mean, this  is a --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are you talking about?  We know they are -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- right now.</p><p>HOFFA:  This is the richest country in the world right now.  And giving it  to the rich people is not the answer to save America right now.  We got to  trade --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I got to push back in it because the tax reform package is  not about the rich. </p><p>HOFFA:  That's what we have to do.  Train the next generation, put programs  in right now that help America grow right now, keep people take care of the  most vulnerable.  That's what we've got to do to make America strong.  You  know the rich are all set, they don't need our help. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kevin Brady just walked through taking the three brackets all  the way down to 10, 12, 25 percent.  That's cutting taxes for broadly  America.  Also, we appointed out many times that 50 percent of the middle  class do not pay taxes.  So, I'm just trying to understand what you're  saying here. </p><p>HOFFA:  You understand what I'm saying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's for the rich.</p><p>HOFFA:  I'll tell you what I'm understanding.  To get there, they're taking  money from the most vulnerable people right now.  They're cutting Medicaid,  they're - they just tried to cut Medicaid.  So trying to cut Social  Security disability, they're trying to go after Planned Parenthood, they're  going after every issue that you can talk about to get this money.  Where  is this money coming from?  We've got to run the country, don't we?  And we  need billions of dollars to run this company and they're taking that money  from the most vulnerable -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just to be clear -- </p><p>HOFFA:  And giving it to the rich people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not most vulnerable anymore.  We know what happened at  Medicaid, we know this program has expanded dramatically to include working  age individuals who are not impoverish, who are not blind, who are not  pregnant and this program has expanded tremendously.  Do you disagree with  that?</p><p>JIMMY HOFFA, PRESIDENT, INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF TEAMSTERS:  I think we  need Medicaid is a great program right now, we need more help for people  right now, I mean there's so many people that are sick in this country look  what happened with the, you know, that the Congressional budget office. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right. </p><p>HOFFA:  Twenty three million people would have been cut.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because they chose to James come on, you are -- it is because  they choose to, James you know that. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOFFA:  We're going to pull the plug on the people that have cancer. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  James let's talk about - </p><p>HOFFA:  They're not going to do, can't have that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fact is fact, the reason that it is 23 million is because the  subsidies and the fees are taken out of Obamacare so if a person decides  they don't want insurance they're not going to taking it, it's their choice  it's not that they are getting kicked off Medicaid, let's state stake facts  James. </p><p>HOFFA:  Well I'm not so sure about that.  What we need Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, we are sure, that's a fact that is not a questionable  thing. </p><p>HOFFA:  You don't like the CBO report. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Nobody believes the CBO report number one, they have been wrong  on umpteen times and the 23 million number.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HOFFA:  They want in the budget too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  James, the 23 - </p><p>HOFFA:  So budget won't work either, so you got a long road to hunt, you  got a long way to go, not going to happen basically let me just. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line give us the bottom line. </p><p>HOFFA:  What you really have to do is the Republicans are going to have to  reach out to the Democrats, they can't get it done they proved they can't  get it done, they didn't get done with ACA so they basically have to reach  out and find some way to get this done, you know, by the bipartisan basis  otherwise you're going to have a chaos in this country.  So it's time to  start reaching out grow up let's work together, let's make America strong. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bottom line, yes, I agree with that let's see if two sides can  work together James that was fun thank you so much really good to see you  thanks for joining us James Hoffa, we'll be right back, stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back good Wednesday morning everybody thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo coming to you from D.C. and it is  Wednesday, July 19th, your top stories right now, 8:34 on the East Coast.   Republicans are pushing forward Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  plans hold the vote next week to repeal Obamacare but it could have  problems on its own as t four GOP Senators are currently disapproving of  the effort.  President Trump will meet with the lawmakers later today to  discuss moving ahead on legislation including both health care and tax  reform, the President tweeted moments ago this saying \"I will be having  lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning health  care.  They must keep their promise to America\".  I spoke with House Ways  and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady just a moments ago about that  reform getting done.</p><p>(BEGIND VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  Let's keep the policy right let's deliver  this year, we still have some work to do obviously in all this in the past  discussion, but again, I think people are going to like the bold  necessities the permanence of this. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  More on future of tax reform coming up this morning.  Meanwhile  a raging wildfire forcing evacuations near Yosemite National Park, the  details as 4,000 people forced to leave their homes.  A spicy deal hits  Wall Street, we're breaking down McCormick four billion dollar move to add  French Mustard and Franks red hot to its big deal in the spice are today,  and McCormick is down almost three percent.  Can (INAUDIBLE) solve this?   IBM reports decline in revenue 21st straight quarter the stock is down  three percent that is dragging the Dow Industrials down, IBM did beat  earnings expectations, on the earnings line but revenue was a miss.  </p><p>The Dow Industrials just slipping into positive territory off just eight  points would be a lot better if not for IBM its shaving 36points off the  Dows game.  NASDAQ up 17 points right now.  In Europe stocks are higher,  but pretty close to the flat line take a look, the F.T. 100 up a third of a  percent the CAC Quarante up a third of a percent actually this is the high  of the morning for the European indices right here.  And the Asian markets  close like this with the Shanghai composite the best performer up one and a  third percent. </p><p>Our top story right now this half an hour health care reform looking more  unlikely as a fourth Republican Senator speaks out against Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell's in repeal plan with the delay replacement.  Yesterday  President Trump expresses his disappointment in the progress so far. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are seven years I've been  hearing repeal and replace from Congress, and I've been hearing allowed and  strong and then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace they  don't take advantage of it.  So that's disappointing, so I'm very I would  say I'm disappointed, in what took place.  It will go on and we'll win on  taxes we're going to win infrastructure and lots of other things that we're  doing. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Still President Trump is not giving up, he just tweeted this,  he said \"I will be having lunch at the White House today with some  Republican Senators concerning health care, they must keep their promise to  America\".  Joining us right now is Georgia Senator member of the Armed  Services and Budget Committee David Perdue, Senator Perdue good to see you. </p><p>SEN. DAVID PERDUE (R), GEORGIA:  Good morning Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining the conversation, you'll be at  the White House today?</p><p>PERDUE:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to see from this meeting, this lunch? </p><p>PERDUE:  Well it's not first time we have been over there talking with  health care I'm one of those Senators that haven't given up on this yet.  I  think we were so close on the original bill that over the weekend I'm  hoping we'll be able to close that again and have the vote to actually to  do the bill, if we don't do that then I'm also one of the ones that think  we need to move on vote for this for repeal. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What -- why we're so close that it couldn't get over finish  line what was the sticking point?</p><p>PERDUE:  Well, there were a couple, probable two or three individuals each  one has their own individual issue, but to give up on it now in last 11th  hour I think is a wrong decision personally I think with Senator McCain's  illness gives us a few extra days and I'm still hopeful we can close that  out over the next few days. </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Mentioning Senator John McCain he  did put out a statement talking about moving on regular order in terms of  the health care bill, what are your thoughts on that. </p><p>PERDUE:  Well he has been a voice for that all along, well I don't like  reconciliation either but it's procedure that we have right now, let's do  this with 51 votes is opposed to 60.  Look I think the deal we have right  now, is going to be better than anything we get when we negotiate with  other side, but they are not interested in  repealing this what they want  to do is basically leave the mandates in place and that is never going to  work for people.  The premiums are the real problem here premiums  skyrocketed, and they're saying now premiums are up because of the  uncertainty around this White House that's ridiculous, you know, we're up  over 100 percent over the last two years alone, in my state we were just  told that the one carrier 96 counties is going up over 40 percent next year  this is ridiculous and that's what we were trying to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now it's time Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  But in terms of the health  insurers who even in the last several months have said that they are  continuing to leave these market across the country.  They do blame the  lack of certainty about this health care bill, for the that -- as part of  the motivation of doing that, and President Trump said yesterday, let it  fail let Obamacare fail.  We're not going to own it, and you don't believe  that do you?  Republicans have to know that if you don't move on this and  you let Obamacare continue to collapse you guys and gallons are going to  own this. </p><p>PERDUE:  Look, you know, Dagen this is not about left and right Republican  Democrat this is about people back home hurting premiums are up  dramatically, you know, that the IRS in 2014, this is much before President  Trump, find 8 million people $1.8 million, and the irony of that is 85  percent of those 1.8 million people are making less than 50,000 a year, and  25 percent of them or half of them make less than 25,000.  That's the  problem, we are all responsible for doing this right. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  How do you feel about your colleague Shelley Moore Capito.  The  first sentence of the statement that she put out yesterday was I did not  come to Washington to hurt people.  That is a slap in the face of other  Republicans, because it suggests that the bill that you are putting out  there was aimed at hurting people. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like a Democrat at talking point children will die? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  She must have seen that Democrat bumper sticker, when she was at  home over the July fourth holiday. </p><p>PERDUE:  Well I can't comment on her statement but I will say this my  observation after two years coming from business world is that the self- interests sometimes Trumps national interest when I see that in every issue  we take up, up here the drive to get reelected is profound in this place  this more on the we've got to get this right I'm not willing to give up on  yet because people back home are really hurting. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Do you think there's a dysfunctional Republican party at this  point that It's so divided that conference simply cannot come together. </p><p>PERDUE:  You know it was dysfunctional we had a super majority in 2009, and  10 cram Obamacare down the throat and now millions of people are hurting if  we could start over and not have to fix this mess could be a lot easier.   Right now that's the game we've been given and so that's why it's so  complex this would not be very difficult if we could go back. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Should you have just done a full repeal with a replacement from  the beginning rather than tweak Obamacare, I mean that's what Rand Paul's  problem is.  </p><p>PERDUE:  Well yes, but the details around that are complicated because  under reconciliation you can't repeal everything, and so that his point but  the reality is you're not going to be able to do that anyway if you go to  60 votes you're not going to repeal Obamacare there is no way the Democrats  are going to get the votes to do it. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  So when you go back home to your constituents, how do you sell  this package I think that's been one of the biggest issues is selling the  bill, how you handled it?</p><p>PERDUE:  Access, right now they're afraid of losing access premiums,  premiums I know of skyrocketed their losing their insurance because they  can't afford the insurance, three is we put Medicaid on a long term  sustainable path and four we protect preexisting conditions that's what we  wanted to do, that's what this bill does actually.  Now nobody's going to  get 100 percent perfect bill, I'm not a 100 percent satisfied but I come  from the real world where you never get 100 percent on what you want you do  this because it's the better good. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  If you can't get to it to the floor next week of repeal what  happens? </p><p>PERDUE:  Well that's a great question, you know, right now Obamacare lives  and you see more and more people losing insurance, they're saying it's  collapsing under it's own weight.  The reality is Congress has to do  something, sooner than later, I think the bill we have in the Senate right  now is the best alternative we're going to have and that's.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you're going to be here for the first two weeks you're not.</p><p>PERDUE:  Absolutely. </p><p>BARITOMO:  You're not taking the recess. </p><p>PERDUE:  Well, we gave we sent a letter actually 10 of us to leadership  into their credit they responded and said they are going to keep us here  fleece first two weeks in this five week state work week of break. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Do those Republicans who are opposing this bill, do they realize  that Obamacare will be status quo that they're supporting Obamacare by  doing this. </p><p>PERDUE:  Well, that's the question, I mean what's the expectation here if  you don't like this what's the altering in the real world the business  we're you guys talk about every day.  You deal with options, we have two  options Obamacare or this deal. </p><p>MCODWELL:  That's why it's important to have at least that repeal vote  because if you vote against repeal, then we know and this country, that you  are voting to keep Obamacare in place, try and run on that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Target on your back tax reform you think it happens this year  you got to get health care too.</p><p>PERDUE:  Well we got to, we don't have a choice but we've got it get going,  I mean we only have some like 44 days and that's if we work Fridays after  September 30th.  We're not going to get to it before September 30 we got to  fund government.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you want the border-adjustment tax in there?</p><p>PERDUE:  No absolutely not under any circumstances. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Senator Perdue, it's good to see you thank you so much Senator  Perdue there, we'll be right back, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  IBM to shave more than 30 points off the Dow  Industrials after round of disappointing revenue.  Nicole Petallides on the  floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  IBM strayed down three percent, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  That is right, Maria.  We  are seeing it some under serious pressure; this is now 21st quarter  declines in revenue year-over-year.  This is atrocious and is in a  microscope by those onboard.  Really, the shareholders overall, the stock  down 2.7 percent right now, likely to shave 29 points off Dow Industrials.   Now he's really under microscope from the board members and investors that  have seen IBM shares last five years really underperforming Microsoft and  Amazon, and the like.</p><p>They did beat on earnings, but anybody who follows IBM knows the day after,  the last 10 quarters, nine quarters, it traded lower so it is right in line  with what we are used to seeing from IBM.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is why the stock is trading down, I guess.  Nicole, thank  you.  We want to look at breaking news right now, President Trump just  tweeted again says this, the Republicans never discussed how good their  health care bill is and it will get even better at lunchtime.  The Dems  creamed death as Obamacare dies.  There you go.  The president talking  about his big lunch this afternoon. </p><p>SCHLAPP:  My question to Senator Perdue which is how do you go out there  talk to constituents that is one of the biggest problems?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why weren't they doing those months ago? </p><p>PERDUE:  It wasn't fundamentally different.  They still have the exchanges,  they still have some mandates, pushed them on mandates, Senator Cruz, so it  was hard to distinguish the two. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, technology stocks on pace to set fresh records again  despite turmoil in D.C.  Joining us host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart  Varney to weigh in.  Tech is hot, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX NEWS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Tech is hot.  May I just say and  would ask you my colleague Mercedes right there that I will indeed chill  out even though we've got gross Republican failure on health care.  I  promise I will chill.  OK, Mercedes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Stuart, you win today but tomorrow is another day, the battle is  not over. </p><p>VARNEY:  OK.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I am going to start calling him, I am going to come up with a  new name for these liberals because tax and spend.  They are democrats. </p><p>VARNEY:  We sorted this one out yet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now we know who we are talking about.</p><p>VARNEY:  My premise is this. I think the big five technology companies are  immune from politics.  Since when has Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft,  Facebook, since when have they really cared whether Obamacare lives or  dies?  They have few American employees that don't have to cover many  people.  They don't care whether Obamacare goes away or stays, same as tax  cuts. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Unless they get hit with a big old fine from the Department of  Justice or the E.U.  I mean, look what E.U. is doing, right? </p><p>VARNEY:  So what?  I mean, how much money has Google got on hand in cash?   I will tell you, Apple has 225 billion, and you think they care about a  little fine from the Europeans?  I don't think so.  They're immune from  politics. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, see you 10 minutes.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" top of the hour,  we'll be right back right here</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, back to us now.  Final thoughts from this all- star  panel right now, Mercedes Schlapp.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The Senate needs a Hail Mary pass to get this health care reform  bill done.  I think we got to be looking at obviously, Senator Moran and  Senator Lee to see if there's any movement there.  At this point, they're  even proceeding to vote no on a motion to proceed which would you want  allow a debate on this legislation.  I say let's debate.  Let's bring it  out on the Senate floor to see what happens at the legislation. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Stuart Varney just made a very important point in the earlier  segment.  The big tech companies in the U.S. are immune to Washington.  I  think we have to ask that about the broader economy.  If this economy is  going to get going, it has to come from private sector from private sector  innovation and private sector investment and private sector optimism.  And  maybe we focus too much attention here on Washington. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The private sector will get -- they will take their cue from  tax policy and health care. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's one fact and a lot of other things.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And alleviate the burden of Obamacare to paraphrase The Wall  Street Journal editorial today, if you fail on your commitment to voters  repeal and replace, then what are you?  This would do untold damage to the  Republican Party.  What's your slogan going to be? </p><p>SCHLAPP:  It is too hard. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's the bottom line.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart Varney and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.  In behalf -- I didn't hear that.  So, I'm not going to  respond, OK? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, you missed the good one.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Oh no, I did.  All right.

Good Wednesday morning,  everybody.  Thanks for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday July 19th.  Your top stories right  now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Tax reform taking center stage.  President Trump will meet with Republican  senators later today as they look to move forward after the health care  bill was pulled.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  For seven years I've been  hearing repeal and replace from Congress.  And I've been hearing it loud  and strong.  And then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace,  they don't take advantage of it.</p><p>It will go on and we will win.  We're going to win on taxes.  We're going  to win on infrastructure and lots of other things that we are doing.  We've  won and are winning the war, as you know, in the border.</p><p>We are very much decimating ISIS.  You can see that, you see that better  than anybody sees it -- the soldiers that are with us today.  We've had a  lot of victories but we haven't had a victory in health care.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what will that mean as the GOP moves forward?  Will  Democrats come to the table?  The prospect of crossing party lines to get  things like tax reform done, coming up.</p><p>Hitting reset with Russia, President Trump's plans to nominate former  presidential candidate John Huntsman as the U.S. ambassador to Russia.   What the move means for rebooting relations there.</p><p>And Apple hitting the panic button -- the details behind the company's new  feature that could make it easier to call 911.</p><p>Morgan Stanley the name to watch today in financial services.  The bank  just reported second-quarter earnings above expectations.  Stock is up one  and a half percent on Morgan Stanley.  Take a look, the numbers were  strong.</p><p>Futures indicating a mixed market this morning at the opening of trading.   The Dow Industrials are down right now although the Nasdaq is up 15 points  and the S&amp;P 50 just barely in positive territory.  Fractional gains are  what we are looking at.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mostly higher this morning with the exception of the  DAX index in Germany.  The FT 100 in London and the CAC 40 in Paris are up  fractionally.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets closed higher with the best performer in  China.  The Shanghai composite up one and a third percent.  The Nikkei  average also higher as well as the Hang Seng in Hong Kong.</p><p>What do we have here?  \"Star Wars\" fans are in the cloud after director Ron  Howard releases the first images of a young Lando Calrissian from the \"Han  Solo\" movie.  We'll bring it to you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to talk all about  it: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Fox News contributor and  Republican strategist Mercedes Schlapp.  Great to see everybody today.  </p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Dagen --  did you know all about this young Calrissian?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, I know the story.  And I was going to say you know it's  going to be a great day when you hear Maria Bartiromo talking about Lando  Calrissian at 7:02.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  There's only one \"Han Solo\" and that's Harrison Ford in my life.   So I don't know if we can have a young one.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And maybe only one Lando -- Billy Dee Williams.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The movie is great.  We're going to show you the pictures that  Ron Howard posted.</p><p>We've got a lot coming up this morning.  We're talking taxes.  Joining the  conversation: Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano is  here; Texas congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  Kevin Brady is here with us.  Chairman Brady will join us.  Plus the  International Brotherhood Teamsters president, James Hoffa is with us this  morning.  He's going to join us as well.  And Georgia Senator David Perdue  is here.</p><p>We have a big show ahead.  You don't want to miss a moment of it.</p><p>Let's kick it off right now this hour with our top story.</p><p>The Trump administration turning its focus to tax reform after the GOP's  move to repeal and replace Obamacare stalled.  Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin says that it is time for tax overhaul to bring profits back to the  United States.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  On the business side we  have one of the most complicated systems in the world.  We tax on worldwide  income with our system of deferral.  It is not surprising that trillions of  dollars are left overseas.</p><p>We want to bring back those profits with a lower business rate so that  companies can invest in America.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  This as the House Ways and Means Tax Policy Subcommittee will  hold a hearing today on reform ideas to simplify the broken tax code and  deliver economic growth.</p><p>Joining us right now is Illinois Congressman Peter Roskam, the chairman of  that subcommittee.  Good to see you Congressman.</p><p>REP. PETER ROSKAM (R), ILLINOIS:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>ROSKAM:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what -- give us your early thoughts in terms of what you  want to discuss at that tax hearing today?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Today we're going to be talking about individuals and basically  the crushing nature of 70,000 pages of our tax code which just blows  people's minds and it's just completely overwhelming.  And think about this  in your own life and all of our own lives, how much we long for simplicity  and easier experience all the way around.</p><p>TSA pre-check, going through the easy lanes and i-pass or whatever it  happens to be.  We're focusing in on what a simpler code means.  And the  blueprint that we have in the House, under that, 95 percent of American  taxpayers would fill their tax code or their tax return out on something as  simple as a postcard.  So today it's focused on individuals.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, ok.  So it's simplification is the focus today.  Do you  believe you and your colleagues are going to be able to get some tax reform  done this year?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes, I do.  And here is why.  There's nobody who is defending the  status quo.  Nobody loves the tax code.  People like the ACA.  People don't  like the ACA.  Nobody likes the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p>Now, they like certain elements of it, obviously but nobody likes the whole  thing.  So that creates basically an inflection point.  And I think what  we've got to do is recognize the inflection.</p><p>Nobody likes the IRS either and the best way to get the IRS under control  is get the tax code under control.  So in answer to your question, I think  it's more likely than not that we get tax reform done in 2017.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman -- on the individual front, the ACA had a couple  of provisions that hit individuals surtax on payroll taxes and also  investment taxes which hit individuals about $200,000 years, married  couples about $250,000.  That didn't get done.</p><p>Is that going to show up in the tax reform that you are going to be  advancing and Congress is going to be advancing?  Does that get moved over  into the next thing or is it dead?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Now, I don't think it's dead.  I mean the proposal in tax reform  is to lower these rates all the way down.  And we presuppose that the ACA  was taken care of in terms of repeal.</p><p>Now, I recognize the drama of the health care debate.  But part of getting  these rates down is driving towards growth.  And there's a real interesting  fault line (ph) that's out there that's developing in terms of tax  discussions right now.  And that's a world view about what the economy is  like.</p><p>There are some people who have convinced themselves falsely that the  economy is a zero sum game.  That if you benefit, that somehow that comes  at my demise.  That's out of sync with really who we have been as a people.   By and large, I think the smarter way -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're talking about cutting taxes for higher-income Americans.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.  And so the question then, you know, the question becomes the  question of distribution and so forth.   But here is the underlying theme.   Let's grow this economy and the growth numbers that come out of the  blueprint, for example, it's moving the economy from 2 percent to 3 percent  growth.</p><p>I mean that type of growth just takes your breath away.  So that's really  worth pursuing.  But that's in answer to your question by trying to get  these rates down generally -- yes, we're trying to -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Congressman -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The deductions, do they go away?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Well, you've got to look at that -- so I represent a jurisdiction  outside of Chicago that has high taxes.  So I'm very mindful of looking at  the totality of this package.</p><p>So it really matters to me what the rates get to, how it relates to the  elimination of the AMT and other things.  We did some focus groups back a  few years ago when Dave Camp was chairman of the committee looking at the  Camp draft.  And what was interesting about the focus groups was it was  folks were willing to come in and look at the totality of the presentation  without coming in and saying I need this particular thing, I need that  particular thing.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It sounds like you're hedging a little on state and local  deductions?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  I'm open-minded, my friend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So did Congress, Republican Congress voted on an Obamacare  replacement, moved it.  The senate and these tax and spend liberal  Republicans killed it.  It's dead.  How frustrated are you with that and  what is the likelihood that happens?  If you guys move tax reform and it  moves to the Senate and they do the same thing because they are buying into  some Democrats' bumper sticker.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  I'm not ready to just put the, you know, put the cloth over the  face and say that the health care debate is dead in the Senate.  You know,  we had our -- our episodes in the House and it comes back and so forth.  So  there's a little bit of a lurch going on.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think they still can get a vote in the Senate?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Look, let me put it this way, I think it's possible.  I'm not here  pumping sunshine but I think it's possible.  Now that said, there's a lot  of work that was done in the House.  It's frustrating to see what the  Senate is doing, squandering that basically.</p><p>What we are trying to do is avoid that hassle with tax reform.  So in other  words, trying to come to a sense of agreement at the front-end of things on  these larger themes and then driving it.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  What are going the basic parameters of this?  What are you  going to be selling to the American people?  What are the two or three  things that you're going to be able to tell the American people they're  going to get when this is over?</p><p>ROSKAM:  Here's what you get.  You get real growth.  You get simplicity.   And you get permanence.</p><p>Right now we've got temporary tax policy in this country and permanent  spending policy.  Let's fix that.  Let's move that.  We can do that. </p><p>There are so many people that perceive the tax code that somehow, like it's  a natural disaster, like we can't do anything about this.  This is not  Hurricane Katrina.  These are all self-imposed rules.  And since nobody  likes them, let's change it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But before all of this you've got to get to the budget, right.   I mean the House Budget Committee released its $4 trillion plan yesterday  for the 2018 budget marking the first step toward tax reform.</p><p>House and Senate approval of that budget would unlock reconciliation.  That  the tool you need -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  That is -- that's the key.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- to allow you to pass tax legislation in the Senate with a  simple majority.  But critics of this administration are citing the lack of  major reform so far.  So you think that -- can you walk us through the  steps in terms of what happens next regarding the budget reconciliation  leading to tax reform?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  So you've got to -- here is what somebody has to recognize in  terms of voting yes on the budget reconciliation.  It is your only key,  realistically, to fundamental tax reform in the same way that the previous  budget reconciliation vote was the only way you were going to get to a  health care vote.</p><p>And so what you want to avoid is sort of pre-negotiating what is going to  be in tax reform because that becomes pretty limiting and self-defeating.   So the name of the game is gather the momentum, get a sense of vision about  it, put the votes together, and move forward on that basis.</p><p>And I think that there's a capacity in the House to do that.  Again, it's a  challenging environment all the way around.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What Democrats you think are going to work with the Republicans  to get tax reform done?  Can you name any Democrats that you think will be  on board?</p><p>ROSKAM:  I don't want to name names but we've had a number of substantive,  fruitful discussions with groups of Democrats in the House that are  surprisingly interested in tax reform and whose themes even resonate with  the growth theme that I articulated a minute ago.</p><p>There some distributional tables -- I mean the distribution is one of the  things that comes up in a lot of these conversations, but there are some  folks that are coming to the table in good faith.</p><p>Now, can we all get there at the end of the day?  Your guess is as good as  mine.  But we're going to pursue it and we're going to try.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can you get permanent reform in a 10-year budge -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  No.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- reconciliation?</p><p>ROSKAM:  No, you can't.  </p><p>So what you've got to do is you've got to make sure that you don't do  violence to the deficit basically within -- it's 20 years.  So if you do  that, then you're at permanent.  And I think that's the name of the game.</p><p>What we don't want to do -- if we are trying to influence corporate  behavior which we are, we want companies to bring their business back here  and so forth.  What company is going to repatriate some element of their  manufacturing if some of these attractive things just evaporate in 10  years?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You talk about the -- about the budget tables.  It looked like  Republicans are getting a little squeamish about reducing taxes on higher  income households.  Is that debate going to show up in this tax debate?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Well, that debate is always present.  So yes, it will be here.   But I think ultimately you've got to reframe the debate.  And the debate  has to be around growth and that is, you know, getting out of a zero-sum  game world view in terms of the economy and saying this matters -- growth  matters.  Everybody benefits.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, and send some of these Republican senators to reeducation  camp where they can get on board whether you have the likes of say a Dean  Heller and Jerry Moran.  They endorsed a balanced budget amendment but then  they essentially moved against a trillion dollars in spending cuts.</p><p>They talk about the -- the detriment of higher taxes, Obamacare $700  billion in taxes and they wouldn't vote for a bill in the Senate that cuts  taxes dramatically.  That's appalling.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  The CBO and the fed are saying 2 percent growth.  You're  saying 3 percent growth.  What do they have wrong?  What do the CBO and the  fed have wrong about the economic -- </p><p>ROSKAM:  Well the CBO, God bless them, has gotten a number of things wrong.   I'm not here just to pile on them but they got Obamacare fundamentally  wrong -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So then why are we focused on them so much?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  We shouldn't focus on them.  And we should look at other scoring  elements as well.  So Congress is complicit and to your point by creating - - </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean the whole 20 million uninsured is just a lie because  people can choose not to get insured.  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Right.  It's an over-characterization and what happens is the  over-characterization gets clung (ph) on.  But it was the tax foundation  that has evaluated this.  They have a great reputation in town for calling  balls and strikes and they've evaluated the blueprint and said out of the  blueprint you're going to see 3 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So how long before you think we see a move in GDP as a result  of -- once you do get tax reform?  </p><p>ROSKAM:  Look, if we get this thing done in 2017, I think in the beginning  of 2018, in anticipation of this -- you know how this works.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>ROSKAM:  People see it coming and, there's a sense of certainty.  They say  we're going to invest and we're going to go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They start changing their behavior.</p><p>ROSKAM:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great to see you -- Congressman.</p><p>ROSKAM:  Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.</p><p>ROSKAM:  Yes.

Lea -- good morning.  </p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>Well, President Trump ending months of delays yesterday by announcing his  intention to nominate Huntsman to the post.  Now, if confirmed by the  Senate, Huntsman will assume the job amid ongoing investigations into  Russian meddling in the 2016 election.  </p><p>Now he does have diplomatic experience.  He's previously served as  ambassador to China and to Singapore.</p><p>And check this out -- real progress for young Afghan women.  Six Afghan  girls meeting Ivanka Trump after winning a silver medal for courageous  achievement at a robotics competition in Washington D.C.  Now these girls  were twice denied U.S. visas.  That's before President Trump intervened at  the last minute to get them here to the U.S.</p><p>The Afghan team finished in 99th place but they did beat 67 other teams.   That's wonderful for them.</p><p>Do you ever wish you had like a panic button somewhere with you?  This is  kind of straight out of a James Bond movie.  Apple has patented a way to  allow people to secretly call 911 with just their fingerprint.  The company  says the feature could be used when conventionally calling for help may not  be practicable.  For example, if an attacker or an assailant is watching.</p><p>Well, Apple suggesting a 911 call would be made following a sequence of  fingerprints or touches.  The technology may also tell police where the  user is.  Now, we don't know if Apple will include this feature in its  software upgrades, Maria.  You know, Apple tends to be mum about these  things until they hit the market.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, absolutely.  Thank you -- Lea.  We'll check on that.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer reportedly says he  has not spoken to President Trump in months.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell  and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer hinting at both sides coming together to  get something done.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I would remind  everyone that in that proposal there's a two-year delay, a two-year delay  which would give us the opportunity to work out a complete replacement on a  bipartisan basis with our Democratic friends.  </p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), SENATE MINORITY LEADER:  The door to  bipartisanship is open right now, not with repeal but with an effort to  improve the existing system.  The door is right --0 open right now.   Republican leadership only needs to walk through it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But a new ABC/Washington Post poll out this week shows that 52  percent think that the Democratic Party just stands for being against the  President.  Only 37 percent believe that the Democratic Party stands for  something.</p><p>I want to bring in 32 Advisors CEO, Measure co-founder and Fox News  contributor Robert Wolf in New York.  Robert -- good to see you.  </p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Great to see you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  I mean you see these numbers on the poll.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  People see what's going on, on the left is all this  obstructionism.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they going to participate in any kind of governing?  What  are the chances that the senators work together on health care?  </p><p>WOLF:  Right.  So a few things -- one, I'm completely with you that we  should not be the anti-Trump party.  The Democrats need to stand for  something.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't have our battles at times with  the President and at times we should make sure we're supporting the  President.</p><p>With respect to health care, listen, I think Republicans went for it.  They  went for the 50 vote, quick-win reconciliation.  It and didn't get done.   Now we have to go to a bipartisan approach.  You're going to need 60 votes.</p><p>And there's a few things we have to work together on quickly, especially  with respect to health care.  One is the opioid crisis.  There's no  question everyone would stand for more funding.</p><p>Number two is the individual marketplace.  The mandate is not working.  We  need to change the individual marketplace.  And so those two aspects  absolutely can be passed in a bipartisan way.</p><p>And health care is something we need to do together.  It's 20 percent of  the economy.  How can we not do it one way versus the other?</p><p>Obviously when Obama -- when President Obama did it they got 60 Democratic  votes, this time around they tried to get 50 Republican votes.  It's time  that we actually get the process working together especially on health  care.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So where were Democrats in this process?  Why weren't they  involved in working with Republicans to come up with ideas for fixing the  exchange?  We didn't see them doing it?</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.  Well Jon -- you know why they weren't involved. Because the  Republicans tried to do a reconciliation process and only worked with their  52 senators.  That's a fact, as you know, and actually even the party, they  only worked with about 50 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That sounds like the way they passed Obamacare.  It's like the  way they passed Obamacare.</p><p>WOLF:  Well no, it's not accurate.  They had over a committee.  They had  over 60 meetings in committee with Republicans and Democrats.  They just  couldn't get together.  But they went through a true committee process.</p><p>This didn't go through a committee process.  They tried to do  reconciliation.  And whether we like it or not the President Trump's rose  garden ceremony will be his mission accomplished ceremony.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But wait -- Robert.  I don't understand what you're saying.  I  mean I don't think there were any Republicans who voted yes on Obamacare.  </p><p>WOLF:  They didn't.  But it went through a real process.  It didn't go  through a reconciliation.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Part of it did.  </p><p>WOLF:  It didn't go through reconciliation.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Part of it did.  We just need to point out -- Robert, Democrats  controlled 60 votes in the senate after -- </p><p>WOLF:  At that time.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  So they didn't have to do reconciliation.  </p><p>WOLF:  Just like the Republicans control 50 today and they did not have to  go to 60 votes and they did not get their 50 votes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But Robert -- what happened with this health care bill  particularly in the Senate, this was the Democrats' strategy and maybe they  saw it all along that these Republicans, some of them are tax-and-spend  liberals quite frankly and they weren't going to be able to come together  for anything.</p><p>So all Democrats have to do is stand back.  And now that it's failed, they  can -- now they can come in and say, ok, we are just going to spend more  money to fix Obamacare.  Ultimately do you think that's what we get?  It is  not really anything that's conservative or Republican.  It is Obamacare,  just with more money.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I would respectfully disagree.  I think there are ways to fix  the system.  And you are going to need both sides to get there.  And  certainly the mandate is not working.  You have to figure out how to get  more insurance companies involved crossing state lines.</p><p>There are things that you can get 60 votes on.  If you look right now,  there are some of the former governors who are senators that were in the  swing states -- Joe Manchin, Mark Warner and those types of people and both  sides that are starting to work together.</p><p>Everyone knows that to get to 60 votes you have to bring things together  and everyone wants health care costs to start -- the cost of health care to  lower.  So there are absolute fixes that need to be.</p><p>That being said, whether the Democrats won with 60 votes or the Republicans  are now trying to win with 50 votes -- when something is one-fifth of the  economy, we have to figure out on a bipartisan basis.</p><p>And so you and I can agree to disagree, but I both think we agree that we  need to get some of these fixes done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Robert -- great to have  your insights as always.  Thank you so much -- sir.  </p><p>WOLF:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Robert Wolf in New York.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the unmasking scandal returns to Capitol Hill, former  national security adviser Susan Rice set to testify in the controversial  revealing of names from the Trump team.

Several Obama administration  officials are now expected to face scrutiny on Capitol Hill over their  roles in the unmasking of American citizens.</p><p>A source telling Fox News Catherine Herridge that over half a dozen senior- level Obama administration officials are of interest to investigators  including Susan Rice, who's expected to speak with the senate intelligence  committee behind closed doors as early as tomorrow.  She had postponed that  testimony.</p><p>I want to bring in Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano right now.  Judge, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  First off, why are they hearing this testimony of Susan Rice in  private?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Boy, you're really talking to the converted about that one.   I've been fuming for several days now that we have the right to know.</p><p>The American public has a right to know what Susan Rice did.  What the  congress knows about her and what the congress will do, by putting this  testimony behind closed doors.  We're going to hear leaked a democrat  version, which will make her look good.  And republican version which will  make her bad.</p><p>Think about the Jim Comey testimony.  Whatever you think of Comey as a  person, whatever you think of him as the director of the FBI, he testified  for three and half hours on national television.  And not allowed every  American to form his own judgment of Comey's credibility and the value and  worth of the testimony he gave.</p><p>We will not have that opportunity with Susan Rice or John Brennan or James  Clapper or Samantha Power.  All these people were involved in the  unmasking.</p><p>Samantha Power was President Obama's U.N. ambassador.  She is the chief  diplomat.  She has nothing to do with national security.  She doesn't have  the right to do any of the unmasking.</p><p>We would like to know what she did from her own eyes and ears.  Not from  the opinion of a member of congress who'll be leaking it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, apparently, Susan Rice postponed the house intel  testimony.  An Ohio representative Jim Jordan is wondering why.</p><p>He says, look, what is she hiding after postponing her testimony on the  unmasking of the Trump associate?  The senate intel hearing, I guess, is  still on, right?</p><p>But of course, Rice says she's never leaked anything.  She did admit to  unmasking civilians saying this, when the intelligence community would  respond to a request from a senior national security official, for the  identity of an American, it would brought -- it would be brought back to  them directly, to me or whoever might have requested it.</p><p>So, does she only have herself to blame for the scrutiny she's now facing?   The box stopping her, right?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, yes and no.  She probably was part of a group of people  in the west wing that included Valerie Jarrett and their boss, then  President Obama who have the ability to say, hey, I understand that  president-elect Trump had a conversation with Lieutenant General Flynn the  other night.  Can you get me a transcript?</p><p>The transcript shows up in their names are not in it.  The unmasking is  when their names are revealed.  Now, if they need to know, a, the contents  of the conversation and be the participants in order to enhance national  security, that is lawful unmasking.</p><p>But if they want this for their own curiosity or for political purposes or  to leak it or to humiliate President Trump or General Flynn as we know  happened, that's not only inappropriate, that's a felony which they didn't  have the right to commit.</p><p>So I think they're going to answer some of these questions because they're  going to be accused of unlawful behavior.  But I'd like to see the  questions and the answers as they put to them.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:   Judge, can you explain why this testimony is happening in private?   Republicans are running the show up there.  Why don't they demand that it  happen in public, as they did for Comey?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I wish that I could answer that.  The chairs of both  committees are obviously republican.  They're republican numerically  dominate both committees and those chairs have decided that the hearings  will be in private.</p><p>I will tell you this -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just like they decided when Hillary Clinton did her interview  that it shouldn't be recorded.  And it was off the record.  And Comey  wasn't doing it.  I mean -- I know.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Sometimes, the witness's lawyer succeeds in negotiating cushy  arraignments for the witness.  Like the two incidents that you just pointed  out.  That may very well have happened here.</p><p>But hear me out on.  These people have not been subpoenaed.  They've been  requested to show.  When you request to show, you can demand certain  conditions, among those must have been the cameras not be there.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So why subpoena them then?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know why they're not subpoenaed.  They should be  subpoenaed.  Well, if they're requested, they can't leave.  If they're  requested, as is the case with these for that we know about, they could  leave and they can refuse to answer whatever they want.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  They'll still be under oath though, judge,  correct?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes, they'll still be under oath.  Remember, there's another  law here.  Occasionally, believe it or not, congress forgets to administer  the oath.</p><p>So to correct -- instead of requiring the oath, they enacted another  statute, misleading congress.  So if you're not under oath and you lie, you  can still get in trouble.  If you talk under oath and you tell the truth  and you mislead, you can still get in trouble.</p><p>But the American public has the right to form those opinions for ourselves  by watching this testimony.  And the congress shouldn't be keeping it from  us.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Judge, you mentioned about  Samantha Power.  And it seems my sources are telling me that she is the one  to watch right now, based on intelligence reports out there.</p><p>What are your concerns?  And you mentioned her earlier in terms of what her  role could have possibly have been in terms of these unmasking.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  That's a great question, Mercedes.  And I think I have the  same concerns that you do and a lot of the American public does and that is  this.  That in the last two months of his administration when Barack Obama  knew that he was going to be succeeded by somebody desperately, did not  want to succeed him.</p><p>He changed the internal DOJ and intelligence community regulations which  permitted any raw intelligence data lawfully possessed by anybody in the  intelligence committee to be shared with anybody else in the intelligence  community.</p><p>So my fear about Samantha Power is that she, under the guise of being  involved and intelligence, was really involved in subterfuge that is in  selectively revealing raw intelligence data for political purposes.</p><p>Mercedes, that is a very serious threat to personal liberty and a free  society.  If the government, which we permit to capture every word and  keystroke that we had on our communications can use that for political  reasons rather than national security purposes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she did it likely based on directives from her boss,  President Obama.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I think that that is probably correct.  And I think as angry  as I am about the republican solving this as a secret, they found it out  and that's why she, to her surprise, has been asked to testify.</p><p>You can't make this up.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me turn to Trump.  Because it was revealed that Special  Counsel Mueller has taken an interest in the now infamous Donald Trump, Jr.  meeting, specifically the eight persons in the room.</p><p>Legally speaking, is there anything here, judge?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, I don't believe that the meeting was a criminal act.   And you can meet with anybody you want.  And words are protected as long as  they're not followed by agreements or actions which is illegal.</p><p>But the circumstances of the meeting, a former prosecutor, former Russian  prosecutor, a former Soviet counterintelligence agent, and what appeared to  be an offer to reveal data, information about Hillary Clinton, during the  campaign from foreign nationals, is enough to commence an investigation  that Bob Mueller assure you he has started that investigation.</p><p>In fact, we know it because of the communications that he had with Senator  Feinstein of the senate intelligence committee.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  But judge, I think yesterday, I think you mentioned on Fox about  the fact that Donald Trump, Jr., if there would be an exchange of  information, would it be a crime?  I think you said yes.</p><p>I just don't see the crime there.  I think when you look at the district  court ruling on what constitutes a solicitation.  It's very restricted in  terms of either a direct campaign contribution to a foreign government or  from a foreign government or for express advocacy.  It's very clear in the  law and it actually restricts the federal election commission.</p><p>So my question to you then is, I don't see the crime.  Do you see crime?</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Not in the meeting, no.  There's certainly was no criminal  behavior in talking to these people.  Because speech is protected.</p><p>If there was criminal behavior, it will be something that happened  afterwards, that is if information actually came from a foreign national.</p><p>It's a felony when you're running a federal campaign or participating on a  federal campaign to receive something a value.  Even something truthful  from a foreign national.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Judge, the case was very clear that it was restricted in terms of  actually being a financial contribution from a foreign government or to a - - from a foreign government or an issue advocacy in terms of what the case  describes.  So I still see it as a felony.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And let's face it, if you're in a campaign -- </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  We don't have any evidence of a felony, but we have enough  evidence to commence an investigation by Bob Mueller which apparently has  commenced the statute prohibits receiving something of value, you know as  well as better than any of us that opposition research is something  campaigns paid for so that's not something a value.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And if someone says to you you're running a campaign,  if someone says, I have damaging one of your opponent, you're going to  tell, yes, I want to hear it.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Almost anybody would say, oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Not the soviets.  I grew up in a household where my parents like  so many Americans feared the Soviet Union.  And they knew better than and  Natasha called on the phone and wanted a meeting, you say no.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sure that if this happens tomorrow, at least run it past  campaign counsel who would say, stay away from me, people.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The problem here is that they put themselves in the position  where they could have committed a felony.  We don't know that anything but  they put themselves in that position and that -- so it's something about  the judgment at least of Don, Jr.  And that triggers the Bob Mueller  involvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know.  I was going to say, go on the judges -- I'm sorry, the  lawyer's Facebook page and it's like free Melania, Anti-Trump.  I mean,  it's like she wasn't working for Trump.  So she's against Trump.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Using GPS are very controversial organization that was involved  in the dossier.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Work with the democrats on that.  So, it just doesn't  smell that -- </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Fishy business.  Stay away from the Russians.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  My pleasure, guys.

Well, the de- radicalization effort is following the footsteps of countries like Saudi  Arabia, Egypt, and Algeria that offer rehab for terrorist.</p><p>Now such programs simply takes several years and they consist of a  combination of religious teachings, vocational training, and counseling  that sort of tailored to the person.

Beginning  next season, NBA teams are going to have four versions of their uniforms.   Four, two for home, two for away.  Two of the four uniforms were revealed  yesterday by Nike, which takes over NBA uniforms from Adidas beginning next  season.</p><p>It revealed some of the newer jerseys that are lighter and more flexible  than before.  Now Nike 3D mapping of players' bodies and also map the body  heat and sweat to manufacture a jersey that could best sustain the rigors  of around four miles of running that players travelled each game.</p><p>Now, instead home teams wearing traditional white, they'll be able to  choose between two home jerseys and then the road team will wear its  contrasting jersey.</p><p>Baseball is not only for trade deadlines, still 12 days away.  But some  teams aren't waiting.  It was a two for Tuesday in baseball trades.</p><p>Todd Frazier is heading home to the New York Yankees.  He was traded from  the Chicago White Sox who get four players back in return.  Like Todd  Frazier, JD Martinez has hit 16 homeruns this year and he's taking his bat  to the Arizona Diamondbacks, who lead the wildcard race and they dealt  three prospects to the Tigers to get Martinez.</p><p>All right.  Here we go.  They went from PhoenixArizona all the way to  Tacoma?  No.  The Tacoma players went from PhoenixArizona all the way to  Albuquerque.  D.J. Peterson, Mark Lowe, Dan Vogelbach, and Pat Light of the  Mariners AAA affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers had booked a flight on American  Airlines to get to their next game.</p><p>Something went wrong with the reservations so they took a seven-hour Uber  together to get to their game on time.  It only cost them $683 and change.   Peterson tweeted, Thank you American Airlines for making Daniel Vogelbach  and I do this last night. #bebetter, #havebettercustomerservice,  #unbelievable.

President Trump tweeted this:</p><p>TEXT: Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \"sick.\"  All G-2  leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany.  Press knew!</p><p>The report coming as republicans push forward on the agenda.  Senate  Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell plans to hold a vote to repeal ObamaCare  early next week.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Let ObamaCare fail, it will  be a lot easier.  And I think we'll end our position where we'll just let  ObamaCare fail.  We're not going to own it, I'm not going to own it.</p><p>I can tell you the republicans going to own it.  We'll let ObamaCare fail  and then the democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say,  \"How do we fix it?  How do we fix it?  Or how do we come up with a new  plan?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president will host lawmakers at the White House today to  discuss the path forward on legislation including both healthcare and tax  reform.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEVIN BRADY, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN:  The president is pushing very  hard on more made American products here in the United States.

What combination of these two  could mean for the industry coming up.</p><p>Markets look like this this morning, take a look at Futures indicating a  mixed opening for the broader averages, DOW Industrial looking lower by  about four points.  Nasdaq strong this morning, up a quarter of a percent,  17 points higher on the Nasdaq.</p><p>In Europe, stocks are mostly higher across the board, take a look, FTSE100  up a fraction as is the CAC Krones and the DAX Index.

And Fox News Contributor and  Republican Strategist, Mercedes Schlapp.  Great to see you.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, WALL STREET JOURNAL CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:  Great  to be here.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX CORRESPONDENT:  Hey Mercedes, could you hand out like  sweatshirts in this town for the republicans?  We'll put a big R on them so  we actually know who they are.</p><p>Because all of these lawmakers, these senators who have given into liberal  ideals and democrat messaging on ObamaCare and it's shameful.  Shelley  Moore Capito put out a statement yesterday, you know what the first  sentence of that statement said, \"I did not come to Washington to hurt  people.\"  I did not come to Washington to hurt people.\"</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It sounds almost like --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  That is a democrat's bumper sticker. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well that's a talking point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It is.  But she's following the Elizabeth Warren playbook of its  blood money, this bill is actually blood money.  So I think it's --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  She's a republican.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well here's --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  She's also got her constituency that got her elected and she's  playing to that, right?  She's a moderate republican.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  It shows a great divide in the Republican Party now in terms of  its centrist in -- with the conservatives and where they are.  They did  lose a very important opportunity which is that of true entitlement reform  which would have been what could have happen in this bill.</p><p>Now what you're going to see and I think the path forward will likely be  democrats and centrist republicans.  They might be the winning coalition to  get a bill done, it is going to be a very weak bill and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think democrats really come to the table on this?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Interesting question.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I think they're -- they were ready -- you're already starting to  see centrist republicans and centrist democrats starting to have this  conversation.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  To Dagen's point, one of the interesting questions is, does  some of these republicans get primary in elections coming up next year?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And then the White House is talking about that.  That's one of  the reasons they want to have a vote next week that's going to end up  killing the bills to put labels on some of these people who vote against  it, so then you get primaries to get the conservative republicans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Call them out because we know that there the votes there for a  repeal right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Forty nine of --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It is putting a target on their backs.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, intentionally perhaps.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's good point, that's what you started with.  We're talking  about that this morning.  A lot on the agenda coming up.</p><p>Joining in the conversation, Illinois Congressman Peter Roskam is with s,  he's leading the subcommittee hearing this morning on taxes.

And Georgia Senator David Perdue is here.</p><p>We are coming to you live this morning from Washington ahead of this  subcommittee hearing on taxes.  We're all in on tax reform this morning.   Let's get to our top story right away.</p><p>The White House is confirming President Trump held a second previously  unacknowledged conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin at this  month's G-20 Summit at Hamburg, Germany.  </p><p>The discussion came near the end of a formal dinner for leaders and their  spouses.  Hours after more than two-hour formal sit down between the two  leaders.  President Trump took Twitter to push back on mainstream media  reports describing the dinner discussion as \"a meeting and a private one\"  tweeting this:</p><p>TEXT: Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \"sick.\"  All G-2  leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany.  Press knew!</p><p>On he goes:</p><p>TEXT: The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest!  Even a dinner  arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!</p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in, Town Hall Editor, Fox News Contributor,  Katie Pavlich.  Katie, good to see you, thanks so much for being here.  </p><p>KATIE PAVLICH, EDITOR, TOWN HALL AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good to see  you.  Welcome to D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Well, I mean you see those pictures of the  G-20 sitting there at a table and you see Putin sitting next to the first  lady, Melania Trump and then Donald Trump, the president walking over, how  was this possibly a secret meeting?</p><p>PAVLICH:  How dare the president go next to his wife who is seated next to  Vladimir Putin?  I mean, the biggest question is, who made the seating  chart here?</p><p>Look, the White House didn't disclose this because they didn't believe that  it was a private meeting.  It was clearly on the schedule as a meeting  between G-20 leaders and this reminds me back in the summer of 2016 when  the media tried to nail now Attorney General Jeff Sessions for allegedly  secretly meeting with the Russian Ambassador after an RNC Convention event  that was a public event for lots of people who he certain -- he just passed  by with the Russian ambassador.</p><p>Look, the Trump Administration hasn't been transparent on a lot of Russia  issues but when it comes to the media d, when they repeatedly jumped the  shark on issues like this and say that this is a private meeting when it  was clearly a dinner between many world leaders, Donald Trump didn't just  talk to Vladimir Putin that night, he generally talked to a number of other  people and we're not hearing about those reports.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This is the part that I don't fully understand, was this a  conversation at the table which everybody had or did they go aside and have  a side conversation -- </p><p>PAVLICH:  According to \"The Post\", they were sitting at the table together.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I think the question -- the secret meeting is so dishonest.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well the question will be and I think this where you will see the  White House having to respond is they call it the tick talks.  So what was  the tick talk that happened during the dinner?</p><p>And I think that that's where in my -- I mean Katie, I would like your  thoughts, don't you think in terms from the communication standpoint, the  White House having to talk about maybe more in detail about -- </p><p>PAVLICH:  Well -- and that is one of the complaints in the \"New YorkTime\"  story and the \"Washington Post\" story is that there's no official record of  what was said, there was not an exact official timeline, there's some  discrepancy between what the White House is saying and what the reporting  is saying.</p><p>The reporting state it was an hour-long conversation, the White House is  saying, \"No, it was much shorter than that, it was just banter, an open  dinner.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well he's just walking over to him on the table, how was that - - he sit there for an hour?  Was he standing up?</p><p>PAVLICH:  He sat down.  So Melania Trump, the first lady was seated next to  Vladimir Putin.  So, again, who sat her next to Vladimir Putin?  So he went  over and sat between them, so he happened to have this conversation with  Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Now according to the reporting, other world leaders who aren't quoted, the  only people who are quoted on this are people who weren't there thought it  was a very strange exchange but I think the White House could be helpful in  a sense of providing more details about what was said, what kind of  conversations they were having to really prove that it was nothing more  than just a dinner.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So one of the concerns was that the only other person involved  in their conversation was the Russian translator.  So there was no one on  the American side keeping a record of it, being able --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it wasn't a formal meeting.</p><p>PAVLICH:  But you know -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean could I say to you, well who else did he speak with?   Was he -- did he see anybody as he walked to the bathroom?  Was he -- as he  was going back to his room, did he see the Italian president?  Did he see - - I mean this is ridiculous.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  But remember that the press has been focused on how that -- with  the handshake was between the president and Putin, they've checked every  single body language between the two of them.</p><p>It's the strangest coverage in terms of this obsession on Russia.  But let  me tell you, it's the president's job to be talking to the foreign leaders  on a daily basis.  So I think that it's overblown, there were cameras there  that obviously -- that we're seeing coverage of this dinner.  Again, I  think that it's hypersensitivity coming from the media and their story on  Russia.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it's really an amazing reaction.  Mainstream media  including \"CNN\" were on the attack after the story of the second  conversation between President Trump and Putin broke, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It makes you wonder, what's the unfinished business  that the president decided he needed to transact after his initial meeting,  we don't know the answer to that and in fact, we may never know the exact  answer of that because we have no record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does anybody believe this?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, they believe it.  The media believes that it is their job to  continue pursuing this Russia storyline.  So then -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, I mean the American people.  The American believe this?</p><p>SCHLAPP:  The American people -- you know, I think that you're seeing that  the American people are tired of this story.  With that being said, I just  believe that it's for the media, and in terms of the mainstream media, they  are focusing on every single possible detail.</p><p>But let me tell you, there's a lot to talk about with Russia, they need to  be talking about the Syria.  Now we saw this -- a bilateral ceasefire  between in Syria.  I mean they need to make progress in the area of Russia.  </p><p>It is a super power, it has strong influence in the Middle East region, I  want President Trump to be talking to Putin on these issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  When we got the ride through of the actual formal  meeting, what went in the actual formal meeting?  Did he challenge him on  entering the Middle Eastern fray?  Did he challenge him on going into  Ukraine, Crimea?</p><p>I mean, did he challenge him on meddling in the election?  This is what we  want to know, what were the real substance -- substantial issues in the  formal meeting?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well the -- I mean the storyline was that he did challenge him  twice on meddling in the U.S. elections, the pushback that some people gave  us that he didn't challenge him robustly enough.</p><p>But we weren't in that meeting, it's hard to know exactly what the body  language was and how tough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But there was a ride through on that.  When I'm talking to  formal meeting, the one that was two and a half hours.</p><p>PAVLICH:  Well he did an interview, the president did an interview with  \"Christian Broadcast News\" and he discussed that, \"Look, we had a very  substantial meeting.  We ended up having a ceasefire in Syria.\" </p><p>Which by the way, was the media very, very focused on these little things  like handshakes and this G-20 dinner and this allegedly undisclosed  meeting?  They're not actually focusing on the results of what had happened  over the past week in Syria which is a ceasefire which came out of the  formal meeting.  </p><p>The president discussed during that interview that, \"Look, Vladimir Putin's  going to do what he needs to do for the best interest of Russia and I'm  going to do the best interest for the United States and we have a good  relationship but we still need to have a dialogue and have much work to  do.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a really good point Katie.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  In fairness to the president, during -- throughout the  campaign he said -- he thought he could get along with Putin and have all  the relationship with him.</p><p>If they sat down at dinner, that's what developing a relationship is, you  can sit down at a dinner with someone and you talk to them.  In my mind,  the problem here is if they went away in the table and had a private  conversation (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Runaway, yes.  That's a good point.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Let's remember -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But if it was at the table, it's fair --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You can't stage a secret meeting.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And let's remember, going from past president to past president,  that relationship with Russia has always been complicated.  </p><p>Whether it be President Obama and his tensed relationship with Putin.   George W. Bush basically saying, \"I've seen the soul of Putin.\"  It is  always trying to figure out a very complicated figure.  And I think for  President Trump, he needs to get to know this guy and really understand who  he's up against.</p><p>And I think that that's very clear and I think that you did see progress  coming out of the official meeting, that was one meeting alone with very  complicated details in terms of issues related to Russia and the United  States.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So final thoughts on this in terms of where this goes?   Are we just going to hear about this ad nauseum on the mainstream media  that there was this secret meeting and nothing and we're still trying to  figure out what was said?  I mean, where does this go?</p><p>PAVLICH:  Congress will probably call in Vladimir Putin to testify in the  committee to talk about what happened during the meeting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAVLICH:  Another investigation will certainly be launched into what  happened that, that's my guess.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Great.  Great conversation.  Katie, thank you very  much for weighing in.  Katie Pavlich there.</p><p>Coming up, we'll take a break.  We are live from D.C. this morning.   Facebook is facing another roadblock in China.  The country reportedly  cracks down on WhatsApp.  What it means for the social media giant.</p><p>And then spectacles with a snappy delivery, how to get Snapchat's glasses  with just one click.  </p><p>Plus, we're all in on earnings this morning, IBM revenue down, we'll tell  you about it, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A ranging wildfire forcing a new round of  evacuations near Yosemite National Park.  Lea Gabrielle in New York with  the details.  Lea, good morning to you.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning to you Maria.  Well  4,000 people had to leave their homes in Mariposa County in California.</p><p>The wildfire threatening power lines that supply electricity to Yosemite.   Now eight buildings outside of the park had been destroyed as hundreds of  firefighters battle that fire, it scorched 25,000 acres.  So far, the fire  is only five percent contained.</p><p>Now we also have some news out of China, WhatsApp is disrupted there by the  government, many WhatsApp users, they're unable to send their videos and  their photos, that's after being blocked by Chinese filters.</p><p>Now, this comes as Beijing broadly tightened its control over digital  services.  The country operates the world's largest censorship system,  Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, those have already been blocked there in  China.</p><p>And for the first time, Snapchat is selling its spectacles on Amazon.   Until now, they're only available on the Snap online store or you could buy  them through the Snap vending machine.  But starting today you can buy a  spectacle for $130 on Amazon.</p><p>So Maria, that means that you can have them, basically a day after ordering  them.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well that's convenient.  Thank you Lea.</p><p>GABRIELLE:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, could the Property Brothers find a new home?   Details on reported merger talks between \"Discovery Communications\" and  \"Scripps Networks\" big deal in the (INAUDIBLE) we'll tell you about it.</p><p>Then Justin Bieber song, \"Sorry\" losses its ranking as the most streamed  song ever.  Which song took over the top spot later this hour, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A deal could be on the horizon between two cable  companies, \"The Wall Street Journal\" this morning is reporting \"Discovery  Communications\" is in talks with \"Scripps Networks\" over possible merger.</p><p>\"Scripps\" is the parent company of both the \"Food Network\" and \"HGTV.\"  Jon  Hilsenrath, what's your thought here?  I mean these two have talked before.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  This is two content companies trying to come together  to navigate a very fast-changing media environment.</p><p>You've got Netflix dominating on streaming and the cable operators in their  position transition and they're talking about coming together to give  themselves more market power in an environment where it's not clear where  content is going to come from.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Especially since we know the AT&amp;TTime Warner deals on the  horizon, Dagen, right?  I mean once that deal happens, if that happens,  you're going to see a whole host of deals happening in telecom and  entertainment.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I'm also curious because this is the third time I think that  \"Discovery\" has approached \"Scripps\" which is controlled in the family  trust.  So it raises a question of is now different than the last two times  that \"Discovery\" made a move?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well it's different and that he media landscape is changing so  much.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Rapidly.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And what -- the logic of this one is that you have two  nonfiction --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love how they refer to it as nonfiction kind of programming  rather than reality.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Reality-type stuff coming together trying to give -- build a  bigger brand off of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They seem to be looking for an edge against digital though.  I  mean we've got this whole change going on in media, I know that and  certainly the Time Warner deal and AT&amp;T deals on the horizon.</p><p>But they are also looking at things like Google, YouTube, the digital  landscape and they feel that getting these two companies together will give  them more hath within that regard.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  There's a lot of very popular content and channels like \"HGTV.\"   We both have shows on the FOX NEWS CHANNEL on the weekends, so we'd look at  the ratings and these are some of the highest rated shows in all of cable  on this network.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You put this much content together, they can launch their own  platform and they can control the delivery which more and more you're  seeing whether than relying upon one r two content delivery providers, you  can rely on yourself at least digitally on (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  What I like about this is that this is two content providers  trying to strengthen their competence as oppose to a content provider  getting together with a delivery provider.</p><p>And we've seen with AOL Time Warner is the classic example of this, that  very often doesn't work when you try to get content and delivery and put  all your content through one pipeline.  I like the idea of these -- of two  content providers getting stronger by uniting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And creating their own delivery platform.  You have one large,  say, app that people have to download and it's not in their content,  potentially wouldn't be as easily accessible on other platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The contents and the delivery right here.  This is not the only  merger today.  Apparently, spice maker, McCormick has reached a deal to  acquire the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group -- Benckiser for over  $4 billion.</p><p>Now Reckitt's brand include French's Mustard, Frank's RedHot hot sauce.   M&amp;A has not been strong this year, we know that it was down first half of  the year but now these two deals on the table perhaps.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And, again, this is another example of two companies  with a core competence coming together.  So these seems to be strategic  mergers as opposed to mergers that are just being driven because interest  rates are low and people want to do deals whenever they can get them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The stock market is high, that's one piece of currency but I  don't know, we'll see if that is enabling.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Well, rather than -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It also points that in this world, bigger is better, right?   So Amazon, Google, the companies that are dominating the stock market these  days are the really big ones.  If it drives to be bigger --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well if they have CEOs that -- if they have CEOs they can manage  a company that big like Jeff Bezos.</p><p>One thing I want to point out which is just a different way of looking at  the stock market because we keep saying, \"Oh, stocks are at record highs,  this is the Trump market, this is the Trump economy.\"  </p><p>Investors are betting on what will come out at Washington.  But a strong  market in the inverse could help President Trump with all the nonsense  swirling around Russia.  With the inaction in D.C., you saw a strong market  really helped Bill Clinton and his scandal with Monica Lewinsky.</p><p>That really -- made people think the economy was good, the strock market  was strong, it made people kind of ignore the salacious details of that  scandal and I think a strong market really helps the president.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But then I think the market right now is beyond the euphoria  that it had early in the year that Trump was going to lead to all these  reforms.  The market right now is going on its own, decent earnings growth,  an economy that's not gangbusters but producing good growth, job growth. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So the market is pointing to a healthy economy and not  euphoria about an agenda that might not happen.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  But it will be interesting to see how not being able to pass this  healthcare reform if -- what impact it could have on the stock market?   Obviously you're seeing insurance companies right -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think it will have an impact.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Absolutely.  And I think insurance companies are already saying,  \"We're uncertain, we really don't know how to plan ahead because of the  fact the republicans have not been able to get this together.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well you have taxes that are in place, the tax capital formation  that still in the ObamaCare plan, the additional payroll tax and that tax  on medical devices makers which destroyed what -- almost 30,000 jobs over a  three year period and the mandate on employers which hurt job creation.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And so one of the challenges the republicans face now is they  move from health reform to tax reform is they take the tax pieces that were  supposed to be in health reform and put them in the tax package.</p><p>There's a trillion dollars worth of tax changes that they wanted to do  there and the poor money isn't that big to do all of that.  So something's  going to give in terms of how much they can give back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can they combine these?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They can combine -- they can address the taxes -- the ObamaCare  taxes and tax reform bill but repealing just the ObamaCare taxes to Jon's  point would be so costly that it limits what else they would be able to do  in tax reform.  So I would guess that they don't even bother.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  And that's -- I agree with you.  I think -- maybe they've  touched the medical devices but in terms of the surtaxes -- for payroll  taxes for the wealthy and investment, then I think you kind of lose -- they  lose there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is why they kept it in that last bill.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's take a break.  We're going to talk about tackling tax  reform this morning.  We're talking with one small business owner about her  fight to cut the corporate tax rate.  Will it happen this year?</p><p>And then Rosie O'Donnell sparking outrage after promoting a game where  users push President Trump off of a cliff, the controversy, next, stay with  us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with a special edition with  MORNINGS WITH MARIA live from Washington, D.C.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good Wednesday morning,  everybody, welcome back, thanks so much for being here.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, and it is Wednesday, July 19th.  Your top stories right now 6:30  a.m. on the East Coast.  Time to tackle tax reform.  After pulling the  Senate Health Care Bill, Republicans turned their attention to overhauling  the tax code.  They'll have plenty of support from Treasury Secretary  Steven Mnuchin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY:  It has been over  three decades since we attacked reform in this country.  This is too long  and this administration is committed to changing this.  On the business  side, we have one of the most complicated systems in the world.  We tax on  worldwide income with our system deferral.  It is not surprising that  trillions of dollars are left overseas.  We want to bring back those  profits with a lower business rate so that companies can invest in America.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, we're speaking with House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman, Kevin Brady, this morning as the committee's tax policy  subcommittee prepares for a hearing in overhauling the tax code later  today.  </p><p>Rosie O'Donnell is rekindling her rivalry with President Trump, but did she  go too far?  The outrage over the new game from the comedian, allowing  players to push the President off of a cliff.  Chipotle wrapped up in  another food scare, the stock hit hard after a possible norovirus outbreak  in a location in Virginia.  The company's response to this latest setback.  </p><p>And markets are looking higher this morning.  Take a look at Futures  indicating a gain at the opening of trading for S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ.   The NASDAQ is up a quarter of a percent right now, 15 points higher.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average just slipping into negative territory, it is  down eight points, fractional move there.  </p><p>In Europe, stocks are mostly higher.  Take a look at the European indices  right now, and we're looking at a live situation here.  FT-100 and CAC  Quarante up a fraction, the DAX Index in Germany flat, down a fraction.  In  Asia overnight, markets closed higher with the best performer there in  China.  Shanghai Composite up 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Well, sorry, Justin Bieber, there is a new king at the top of the charts.   The runway hit that's taking the title of most streamed song ever with over  4.6 billion plays.  We'll tell you about it.  First, though, our top story  right now this half an hour, the fight for meaningful tax reform.  With the  failure of the Senate Health Care Bill, top Republicans are now focusing  efforts on overhauling the tax code.  House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Kevin Brady believes that Congress can still get this done and get  it done quickly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN:  We're  still shooting for the lowest rates possible, the most competitive design  we can and lowering those tax rates whether you're a local business person  or a middle-class family.  And so, I haven't seen anything yet that knocks  us off our pace to deliver it this year.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is the former police officer and DGG  Uniform &amp; Work Apparel President, Teresa Meares.  Teresa, good to see you.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>TERESA MEARES, PRESIDENT, DGG UNIFORM &amp; WORK APPAREL:  Good morning, thank  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're a small business owner.  We want to talk about tax  reform from your standpoint, from a small business owner's standpoint, but  you testified about tax reform last week in front of the House Ways and  Means Tax Committee.  The tax policy subcommittee, as a small business  owner, what was your message to Congress?</p><p>MEARES:  Well, our message was that you need to have a conversation with a  lot of small businesses and you need to do a reform and now is the time to  do it.  So, we were very passionate and had the opportunity to share our  personal stories on how it affected us.  So, hopefully, it'll help move  them along. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, tell us your personal story, how does it affect you?</p><p>MEARES:  So, as a -- as a small business, I file as an S corp., so I -- my  important message was to make sure that they do keep that in there.  I know  I hear a lot of talk about between the C Corp and the S Corp and the pass- throughs.  And that's what I file as.  And when I first started my business  in 2006, I had rapid growth and I added, you know, employees very quickly  and I had to buy a lot of equipment and grow my business.  And at that  point, the lack of simplification on the tax actually cost me to overpay  taxes during those critical years that I needed that cash.  So, you know,  that alone was very difficult for me as a small business and create a  challenge.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Teresa, it's Dagen McDowell,  do you think that politicians with even your local lawmakers are listening  to you?</p><p>MEARES:  You know, I sure hope so.  I definitely think that they're  listening to us.  The only challenge that I see at this point is that  people are getting distracted, and they have their own interests at heart,  but I encourage all small business owners to reach out to their local  Congressmen and let them know how it affects them personally.  It's  important upon us.  Politicians, the House can help push this through but  it's -- small businesses need to get vocal and they need to get involved  and they need to understand how it affects them so that way they can voice  it to their representatives.</p><p>MERCEDES SCHLAPP, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:   Teresa, this is Mercedes,  one quick question.  So, we know that the House -- the Senate Bill on the  health care reform pretty much is dead at this point.  How does that impact  your small business in terms of the health care cost?</p><p>MEARES:  Well, I mean, it's obviously impacted my business as far as cost  and the insurance premiums as well.  So, I was a little disappointed to see  that.  The bright side of it would be maybe everybody can refocus on the  tax reform and we can at least get that pushed through.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, your tax rate right now is 35 percent?</p><p>MEARES:  Thirty-five percent, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And you'd like to see this obviously go down to 15  percent.  If we were to see rates go down to the 20 percent range, they're  talking about 20 to 22, 25 percent.  What does that going to do in terms of  your behavior?  With that extra money that you're saving, are you going to  be investing in your business?  Are you going to be hiring new workers?   What are your expansion plans?</p><p>MEARES:  Yes.  Absolutely.  I sold my -- one of my businesses last year and  then I relaunched another business and I'm growing.  I just hired five new  employees in the last six months.  So, I'm on fast pace to grow my company,  and I need that cash to help me grow.  When I get to the point where, you  know, I'm not break even and I get to that profitability, alone, I figured  it was just a 10 percent reduction that I would have $60,000 to $80,000 to  reinvest back into my company.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Teresa, in terms of how the economy looks to you right now, I  mean, do you get a sense of its strengths, any weaknesses that you worry  about?</p><p>MEARES:  You know, I do think the economy is responding right now, but I  think everyone is very hesitant because they don't know what is or is not  going to pass.  So, I feel that everyone is a little cautious right now  until we can get some solid ground to stand on and some permanents on some  things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, aside from the tax rate, are there any other must-haves in  this tax reform bill that lawmakers are talking about right now that will  move the needle in terms of growth for small business?</p><p>MEARES:  Well, I think simplification and reduction are probably the two  most important tax reforms that they need to address.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Do you think that President Trump is keeping to his commitment of  pushing for economic growth?  Do you think that he's being able to sell  that message?</p><p>MEARES:  I do.  I think he is trying to do that, and I think everyone is  trying to figure out how to work together to get that done.  And I truly do  hope that the bipartisan comes into play and that they're able to look at  the small businesses because as you go down the road just sitting in the  passenger seat and you look out the window, you just see small business  after small business after small business, and that is what makes the  employment number move, and we're the ones that are the backbone of  America, so you have to do something for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's been frustrating that we haven't really seen this  tax package get traction because we're awaiting on health care.  Let me add  on to what Mercedes asked you in terms of the health care implications from  your standpoint, how are you impacted by this setback in terms of the  health care overhaul?</p><p>MEARES:  Well, I mean, I'm not really impacted right now because it's been  in effect so I'm status quo.  You know, I offer insurance to my employees  and I also pay 50 percent of the premium.  If it doesn't, you know, get  improved or passed or reduced, then I'm going to have to reduce that, and  that's actually going to take more money out of my employees' pocket.  And  I can't give them a raise and I'm going to have to take more out of their  paycheck to help pay for the health insurance, so that's how it will impact  it.  It would impact my employees a lot more.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  The -- you know, something has to give.  Now, the tax  policy subcommittee, you testified before last week, will hold another  hearing today.  This on simplifying the tax code to help individuals and  families.  You say that this is critical, the simplification.  You want  three brackets?</p><p>MEARES:  I do.  I think it's simplification and approach to that is the  most important because like I said, in my early years of growing, when I  had the profitability, I overpaid in taxes, and nobody should have to do  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, well, this is important.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Teresa, my issue is because we are both the children of small  business owners and literally our entire lives we've heard politicians  given lip service to people who own and operate small businesses in this  country.  And right now, as it stands because health care -- repeal of  Obamacare would -- and the replacement would really help small business  owners as will tax reform, but do you think that these politicians truly  understand what it's like to go to work every morning and operate a  business just like you do?</p><p>MEARES:  Well, I think some do because when I testified in front of the  subcommittee last week, there was probably three to five of them that all  came from small business.  So, you know, it's interesting that small  business owners get involved in politics is because they get frustrated  with what is happening and what they have to cut -- carry.  So, I do think  that there are some that understand it, and as I said earlier, it really is  upon the small businesses to stand up and start voicing what is it that  does or does not affect you.  Because you have to look at the sectors, too,  you know, what may help my business may not help a farm business, may not  help a manufacturing company.  So, we need to understand it from everyone's  perspective.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if the tax reform doesn't get done this year, what if they  just cut taxes in a simple way because they can't get health care done,  impact to small business?</p><p>MEARES:  Yes, as it always has been.  You know, I mean, we're surviving but  it's not fun and we're at a point where, you know, something has to give.   So, I think you'll see some frustration.  I think you'll see some people  that will -- may not try to continue or grow their business and that would  hurt employment numbers and it would definitely hurt the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll leave it there.  Teresa, thanks so much for sharing your  story, we appreciate it.</p><p>MEARES:  All right, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Teresa Meares joining us there.  I'll sit down with House Ways  and Means Committee Chairman, Kevin Brady, coming up to talk tax reform  coming up at 8:00 a.m. Eastern.  Join us for the early plans of what he's  expecting from a tax reform package.  </p><p>Coming up, a massive recall for Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler over  emission concerns, the latest following rival Volkswagen's crisis as well.  </p><p>And then other smartphone makers joining Apple's fight against chipmaker  Qualcomm.  The legal battle heating up, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning.  Futures are pointing to  a mixed opening for the broader averages today.  Take a look at the market.   Dow Industrials down about nine points; S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ in positive  territory.  NASDAQ looks good up 13 points right now.</p><p>A couple of names on the move, Qualcomm, a NASDAQ company, it is reporting  third-quarter results after the bell tonight.  Analysts are expecting  earnings of $0.81 a share.  It comes under the company's growing battle  against Apple and other smartphone makers.  Last night, several  manufacturers including Foxconn announced plans to file a lawsuit against  Qualcomm for illegal patent licensing practices.  Qualcomm shares are down  better than 13 percent year to date.  </p><p>American Express also said to report after the close for the quarterly  numbers.  Investors are expecting $1.43 a share on $8.2 billion in revenue  at Amex.  Amex shares are up 33 percent in the last 52 weeks.  </p><p>Well, Rosie O'Donnell's new tweets against President Trump is sparking  widespread outrage this morning.  Lea Gabrielle in New York with the  details -- Lea.</p><p>LEA GABRIELLE, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, hi, Maria.  You know,  Rosie O'Donnell and President Trump have such a rosy relationship.  Yes,  Ms. O'Donnell tweeted, quote, \"Push Trump off a cliff again.\"  Her tweet  links to an online game where players can make a virtual President Trump  jump off a cliff.  Users can also send the character down a manhole, into a  volcano, or into the jaws of a T-rex, very nice.</p><p>Meantime, German automaker, Daimler, is updating software of more than 3  million Mercedes amid investigations that it cheated on emissions.  That  move comes as regulators and criminal investigators on both sides of the  Atlantic are scrutinizing Mercedes-Benz on suspicion that some of its  diesel vehicles cheated on emissions standards.  </p><p>And a song that is now in the history books just six months after its  release.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GABRIELLE:  Universal Music Latin Entertainment says Despacito has become  the most streamed song of all-time, playing more than 4.6 billion times  across streaming platforms.  The track by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and  featuring Justin Bieber, breaking the record previously set by Bieber for  the 2015 hit, Sorry.  Despacito has been at the top of the billboard hot  100 for 10 weeks.  That's the beauty of streaming music, bringing cultures  and languages together so everybody can boogie, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, that's something.  I'm still stuck on the Rosie  O'Donnell story, Lea.  Thank you very much.  Promoting this game where  Donald Trump gets pushed off a cliff, your take.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I -- that's exactly what I expect from Rosie O'Donnell.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's -- OK.  It's your point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  They have a -- they have a long-running feud -- they have a  long-running feud, and she -- and I think that all of these people who go  after President Trump, that they want his attention.  They like and they  love a negative attention especially somebody like Rosie O'Donnell who  really doesn't have a professional career left.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR:  It's getting her attention,  right? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But having said that, and he picked fights with her, so you  could still say --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I said that there's a -- there's a mutual feud that's been  going on for years.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But if someone had done this, something like this to Barack  Obama, it would be universal outrage.  There is a double standard.   Regardless of their feud, there should be a certain respect for the  presidency that she's not abiding by.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But again, I think people are tired of it, I don't know.  Is it  just me?  I don't think people like to see a bloody head being held by  Kathy Griffin and this game and the Shakespeare -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They see a lot of what goes on in this town as noise, it's  just noise.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Kathy Griffin, though, the thing that was so appalling is that  then she turns herself into the victim.  And she makes it about her and she  accused the Trump family of attacking her and trying to destroy her.  That  was the absurdity of it all.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  I mean, it's just a constant pattern of the left, being so --  using these, I think, extreme displays of being critical of this president  whether it's throwing him off the cliff, now it's a game, or, you know,  using that image of the bloody beheading, and I just think they take it too  far.  And I think for Americans, it's kind of like he's the President of  the United States, you might not agree with his policies, but let's be  real, you know, there's no reason to be pushing this type of violence out  there whether it's pushing him off a cliff.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The liberals have been looking for attention.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The liberals has been, good comment.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's all true.  On the other side, you know, they're going  to say, well, look at what he did with that WWE -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- body-slamming the CNN character.  So, it's not like he's  tamping down the environment.   </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he's going to fight back.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SCHLAPP:  No, but that actually kind of funny.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was -- it was a CNN logo on Vince McMahon's body from years  ago.  That's different than a direct obvious portrayal of a President who  has been beheaded.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  And CNN attacks him every day, by the way.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They do.  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back,  Chipotle's stock dipping yesterday.  Customers said they got sick from the  food.  Not again, details on the fast-food chain's illness report.  That's  next.  Back in a minute, live from Washington this morning</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  More trouble for Chipotle.  To tell you about  it, Tracee Carrasco in New York with more on another Chipotle closure.   Tracee, good morning to you.</p><p>TRACEE CARRASCO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Yes,  Chipotle is still trying to bounce back after an E. coli outbreak in 2015  that sickened hundreds of people in 14 states.  And this incident is not  helping.  Chipotle was forced to temporarily close a restaurant in  Sterling, Virginia, that's near Washington, D.C., after at least 13  customers reported getting sick from eating there, two people had to be  hospitalized.  Several customers reported their symptoms on the Web site,  iwaspoisoned.com.  Health officials say the symptoms are consistent with  norovirus, which means the illness did not come from the food supply, so it  is safe to eat at their other restaurants.  Customers, though, aren't so  sure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I know they've had problems in the past, and it's  very discouraging to hear that it's continuing on, so just disappointed.   And I don't think we'll be back for a while.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CARRASCO:  Chipotle has dealt with norovirus cases in the past.  In  December of 2015, nearly 120 Boston College students got sick after a  norovirus outbreak at a restaurant close to campus.  The restaurant's stock  price took a hit on Tuesday as news of the incident spread following more  than 6.6 percent.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, there you go.  I mean, there are real loyalists, though,  to this company.  I mean, some people, regardless of what happens, they  keep going back.  What has the company been doing since this last incident  with -- to win back customers?</p><p>CARRASCO:  You know, Maria, since the incident in 2015, Chipotle has  appointed a senior officer in charge of food safety and implemented new  procedures to help protect against contamination, but with the norovirus,  you know, all it takes is one employee, for example, to not wash their  hands, the norovirus can spread really quickly in places like daycares,  nursing homes, schools, crew ships, restaurants.  And this restaurant in  Virginia was fully cleaned, expected to be back open.  So, we'll see if  customers will head back.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Norovirus. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  When you have these -- when you have these mass outbreaks on  cruise ships, when you have literally almost an entire ship gets sick,  that's what it is, it's norovirus.  It's the classic like stomach bug as my  mother would describe it.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  If this is coming from employees not washing hands, why  doesn't it happen in other restaurants?  Why does it keep happening on  Chipotle?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point, Jon.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  And I've been to Chipotle, they have their gloves on, too,  normally, so I'm -- it's kind of interesting that would have some --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you're not buying the -- it's not from washing your hands?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It actually does happen in other restaurants that just doesn't  get reported quite the same way it does because Chipotle had that huge E.  coli outbreak.  I think that these viruses do crop up.  You can actually  call the CDC.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- they're more in a fish bowl than other restaurants.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's too bad for them because people were just starting to go  back.  I know my son had -- wasn't -- didn't go for a year and he was  starting to get back into it.  And now, we're going to have to look for  someplace else.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see about that.  All right.  We'll take a short break.   We'll be right back.  Thank you, Tracee Carrasco.  Stay with us, live from  D.C. this morning.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Washington, D.C. here is Maria Bartiromo with a  special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Wednesday morning, everybody, thanks for  joining us.

It now seems like \"a quaint relic of the company's early days, when the crayon colours of the Google logo still conveyed the cheerful, idealistic spirit of the enterprise. How long ago that feels.\" The opening of Rana Foroohar's new book, Don't Be Evil: The Case against Big Tech, is not only spot on, her timing is perfect: Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced last week that they were stepping down as leaders at Alphabet, parent company of Google, prompting many to question their record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critics say what started as a benign endeavour to organise information has turned into a corporate Big Brother.</p><p>The charge sheet is long but here are some of the worst sins: hoovering up our vast digital footprint and using it to serve targeted ads; abusing the dominance of its search platform to promote its services over those of rivals; slashing, legally, its tax bills by setting up overseas companies to funnel revenues into tax havens, and flogging ads to Russian agents, enabling them to manipulate the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>Latterly, Brin and Page have been fighting their workers over Google's contracts with the US military and plans, now shelved, to create a search engine censored by Beijing. Last year, 20,000 Google staff walked out over sexual harassment, discrimination and pay inequality.</p><p>It was not always that way, as I found out in 2007 when I first saw the glass-and-steel curves of the Googleplex in Silicon Valley. Back then Brin and Page were in fine fettle.</p><p>They had convinced themselves and most of the world that they were not just shinier and smarter than the average entrepreneur, they were also better because they had a higher moral calling.</p><p>Google would never be like Microsoft, then the poster boy for monopolistic behaviour. As Page and Brin put it in 2004: \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" When I raised privacy concerns, they said I'd got the wrong end of the memory stick. Not a single byte of my Google-generated data would ever be made available - far less flogged - to advertisers.</p><p>What went wrong? Why did digital utopians become rapacious, arrogant capitalists? Money.</p><p>Page and Brin soon realised their hippyish dream could be the best cash machine ever. Their firm now rakes in more than $100bn in advertising revenue a year, helping it to a market value close to $1trillion.</p><p>\"Google has been the pioneer of big data, targeted advertising and surveillance capitalism,\" Foroohar says. \"When Google advised its employees not to be evil, it did so because it knew that evil was more than a powerful temptation. Evil was baked into the business plan.\"</p><p>Google insists it uses \"data to make our services more useful and to show relevant advertising, and we give people the controls to manage, delete or transfer their data\". Critics are dismissive, claiming few people use them or even know they exist.</p><p>Until recently Brin and Page still pulled the wool over most people's eyes. It was not hard to see why. Google makes whizzy, free software, services we use every day, such as Gmail, Maps, Docs and Sheets. Android powers most smartphones.</p><p>But the penny has finally dropped. As techwriter Rob Cox puts it: \"[Google has] the same profit motive that drives all business - and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies. \" In her book, Foroohar lays the blame at Brin and Page's door but also says regulators have missed the point that we all \"pay dearly with our data\".</p><p>That is changing. The European Commission, which has already fined the company more than (EURO)8bn, last week launched a fresh investigation into Google.</p><p>Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to close tax loopholes.</p><p>Page and Brin have refused to engage with their critics. When you are worth more than $50bn each, you can get away with stuff like that.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, the new chief of Alphabet, will have no such luxury. \"The next chapter is going to be a lot around policy, data privacy and regulation,\" points out Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures.</p><p>Or, to put it another way, Brin and Page leaving the Googleplex formally marks the end of the free-wheeling era in Silicon Valley.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Google founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin convinced themselves they had a higher moral calling</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-155488375</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP4-SSM1-DYTY-C09D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet if we asked them what branch of government should take the lead in adapting policy to a revolution in technology, they would say that's a job for Congress. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Alas, I reckon they would be gobsmacked by today's Congress, too. The august creation of Article I of the Constitution can't walk and chew gum at the same time. Often, Congress can't even walk. Gridlock in Congress stalls all causes: the bitterly divisive ones and the vital nonpartisan ones, too. The mobile digital age presents pressing issues, from privacy to the price of broadband. But Congress does, basically, diddly.</p><p>So the need for action falls to the executive branch and the courts - both of them problematic.</p><p>Relying on executive-branch regulators can result in radically shifting rules of the road. The Federal Communications Commission is a good example. Under Trump-appointed Chairman Ajit Pai, the FCC is preparing to reverse existing policy on \"net neutrality,\" which requires that broadband providers treat all data equally. A change of presidents produces a screeching U-turn.</p><p>As for the courts, their limitations will be on display Wednesday in Washington, when the Supreme Court hears arguments over cellphone privacy. You might not realize that your cellular provider keeps track of your travels even when you have your GPS switched off. Each call, text, email and alert that enters or leaves your phone must pass through a nearby antenna.</p><p>In the case before the court, Timothy Carpenter's cellular provider supplied investigators a record of his smartphone's whereabouts. The pings placed Carpenter in the vicinity of several armed robberies in Ohio and Michigan. Now behind bars, he is asking the justices to find this a violation of his Fourth\u00a0Amendment right to be safe from warrantless searches of his private domain.</p><p>Lower courts ruled that pre-iPhone case law was adequate to uphold Carpenter's conviction. Under existing law, if a person passes information through another entity - a \"third party\" such as a phone company or shipping firm - the fact of the transaction is not private. If you send a letter, for instance, the writing on the outside of the envelope can be read. If you dial a phone number, the fact of the call (though not its content) is information owned by the phone company. And the carrier can share that fact with police.</p><p>Carpenter's appeal is supported by big tech firms, leading civil liberties groups and digital privacy advocates. They argue that the transformative capabilities of the smartphone demand new protections against search and seizure of our personal digital property. If our entire lives - not just conversations but also shopping, studying, dating, navigating, playing, dining and documenting our experiences - take place with and through these devices, should all of it be public? Yet we have no choice but to use these increasingly indispensable tools.</p><p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor saw\u00a0this issue coming. Writing in 2012, she\u00a0found existing law\u00a0\"ill suited to the digital age, in which people reveal a great deal of information about themselves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\"</p><p>No doubt other justices share this insight. Judges are human, after all, and few humans with smartphones haven't fretted over the breadth and depth of the data collected by our digital overlords. And the problem doesn't stop with collection. The capacity to store nearly infinite amounts of data assures that our virtual trails will never go cold.</p><p>The need for new privacy protections seems clear. But in such an intricate web of issues, the courts aren't well suited to making policy. Their mandate is to decide the discrete legal questions presented one case at a time. A fully formed body of law from the bench may require decades of maturation through a series of cases.</p><p>Which brings us back to Congress - and, more hopefully, to state legislatures. The legislative branch is best equipped to define big issues, gather research, hold hearings, weigh competing interests and draft comprehensive reforms. Writing as a friend of the court in the Carpenter case, George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr, an authority on the Fourth\u00a0Amendment and writer for the Volokh Conspiracy blog hosted by The Post, has urged the justices to restrain themselves. \"The Court should continue to allow legislatures to debate and decide how much protection cell-site records should receive,\" Kerr asserted, pointing out that California recently passed very strict new privacy laws. </p><p>Partisan game-playing and mutual suspicion in Congress come at a high price. Pressing decisions that ought to be made by elected representatives in open deliberation are instead pushed into the cloistered chambers of the Supreme Court. Lawmakers claim to resent judges who legislate from the bench - but they're making it a last resort.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:david.vondrehle@washpost.com\">david.vondrehle@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-126adc2ed49211e7b62dd9345ced896d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R2H-T371-DXKP-J0TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><timeReceived>12:32 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 29, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Communications Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEQxMkU0NzE2OEE2NDIxNEE3QzU0NjU2MDRERUNGNDE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjJBNjQ3RjNENTI2NEVCQkJFMTI4RTMxNzIyM0QyNjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODRCNkU5NTg3RTNGNDUzMUFEREU0RURCMTEwMDNDMUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

It is among a precious handful of rich countries whose people are more likely to buy a newspaper than follow current affairs on Twitter or Facebook. Scarcely two out of five Germans have a social network account, compared with two out of three Britons and Americans. It is not that they don't like the internet: more than 90 per cent of them are online, and they spend just as much time watching videos of skateboarding pugs, or browsing for remaindered shoes as their European neighbours. It is more that they are specifically reluctant to hawk out their lives for public consumption. My German friends' Facebook accounts are like a fleet of digital Mary Celestes. There might be a profile picture taken on a holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago and the odd status update wishing the world a happy new year, but that is more or less that.</p><p>The country's broader social networking culture is unusually stunted. A few dozen \"influencers\" - including Adrienne Koleszar, a blonde, gym-honed 34-year-old from Dresden who is f\u00eated by the tabloids as \"Germany's most gorgeous policewoman\" - are fortunate enough to scrape a living together from their YouTube or Instagram accounts, but they are very much in the minority.

It is among a precious handful of rich countries whose people are more likely to buy a newspaper than follow current affairs on Twitter or Facebook. Scarcely two out of five Germans have a social network account, compared with two out of three Britons and Americans. It is not that they don't like the internet: more than 90 per cent of them are online, and they spend just as much time watching videos of skateboarding pugs, or browsing for remaindered shoes as their European neighbours. It is more that they are specifically reluctant to hawk out their lives for public consumption. My German friends' Facebook accounts are like a fleet of digital Mary Celestes. There might be a profile picture taken on a holiday in Sri Lanka six years ago and the odd status update wishing the world a happy new year, but that is more or less that.</p><p>The country's broader social networking culture is unusually stunted. A few dozen \"influencers\" - including Adrienne Koleszar, a blonde, gym-honed 34-year-old from Dresden who is f\u00eated by the tabloids as \"Germany's most gorgeous policewoman\" - are fortunate enough to scrape a living together from their YouTube or Instagram accounts, but they are very much in the minority.

Just as importantly he has changed the way the ATO is perceived.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chris Jordan's resolve crackles down the telephone from a car somewhere near Newcastle. Close to 80 of the 800 Australian names in the Panama Papers appear in the Australian Crime Commission's database for serious and organised crime, he reveals for the first time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"And let me tell you, they're not there for not paying parking fines, these are serious criminals,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's April 11, seven days after the leak of documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca, led by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and it's difficult to imagine any of Australian Tax Commissioner Jordan's predecessors having this conversation.</p><p>\"He cuts right to the point, that's why we love him,\" a regulator in another agency comments the following day. \"It's also a learning curve for some.\"</p><p>In person Jordan is affable and engaged. In a series of interviews in the past two years it's clear that, while he doesn't really enjoy the media process, he's getting much better at it. He's feisty and he's indefatigable.</p><p>Three and a half years after he left his senior role at KPMG to lead the Australian Tax Office, Jordan has transformed much of the way the it works. Just as importantly he has changed the way the ATO is perceived.</p><p>It's easy to miss the scale of this change - and the change in institutional power it denotes.</p><p>The clearest sign came in April last year when Jordan was called before the Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance led by Labor senator Sam Dastyari. The script of such inquiries - really, any encounter between politicians and the tax office - usually writes itself. Because who likes the taxman?</p><p>The inquiry had been set up by the Greens after a Tax Justice Network report highlighted how many companies had no taxable income. And while senators would target multinationals such as Apple and Google, the real target was always likely to be the ATO and why it was failing.</p><p>Jordan clashed with Dastyari from the start.</p><p>Dastyari wanted Jordan to breach ATO secrecy rules to reveal names of big mining companies redacted from ATO documents and Jordan refused.</p><p>\"I didn't think this was a precedent I wanted to have,\" Jordan said later.</p><p>Yet within days the political position had been completely reversed, with Jordan following up on his promise that, while he would not disclose taxpayer information, he would respond when he believed companies had misled the inquiry.</p><p>Jordan told the inquiry that claims by BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto, Apple, Microsoft and Google that they were not profit shifting should not be taken at face value, revealing Rio paid more than $100 million to settle a tax bill while BHP subsequently revealed a $522 million tax bill. Jordan emerged from the inquiry as the man of the moment, not a whipping boy but rather an unlikely hero, in terms of public perception.</p><p>Since then politicians from both sides have sought his viewpoint, as he has expressed increasing resolve to pursue tax avoidance.</p><p>He is the government's point man on anything from multinationals to foreign property investors.</p><p>These are conversations that five years ago might have been led by the head of Treasury. And as Jordan's predecessor, Michael D'Ascenzo, is on the Foreign Investment Review Board, the tax office's input into government policy and regulation is increasing.</p><p>When Jordan became commissioner in January 2013 he inherited an organisation under pressure to cut costs as falling commodity prices eroded the revenue base, just as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development launched a historic attempt to rein in multinational tax avoidance (called Base Erosion Profit Shifting).</p><p>Jordan is a momentum player, a master of the front-foot response to a crisis. But he concedes that addressing the ATO's cost base was essential before anything else could be attempted.</p><p>By 2019 ATO staffing will be 23 per cent down from its peak in 2009, while its costs as a proportion of gross revenue collected are being slashed from 0.87 per cent in 2010 to 0.5 per cent in 2019.</p><p>In the last budget, the ATO received $679 million over four years to target tax avoidance by multinational companies and high-wealth individuals (it expects to raise $3.7 billion from this).</p><p>But at the end of the project, general funding will be down 23.5 per cent from 2014 in real terms.</p><p>Jordan also took a hard look at the legal cases the ATO was fighting and made some tough calls to settle many of them, while pursuing others - such as the successful Chevron transfer pricing case.</p><p>Jordan's success at Dastyari's tax inquiry wasn't a one-off. In October 2013, 10 months into the job, Jordan attended a meeting of the OECD's Forum on Tax Administration (FTA) and proposed an international collaboration to target big tech companies, including Apple and Google.</p><p>Jordan led a six-country investigation that set up new protocols to share information - a project that US officials opposed after lobbying by US tech companies. Australia was halfway through a tax amnesty program, Project Do It, in October 2014 when the ICIJ revealed LuxLeaks - the leak of hundreds of secret tax deals by the Luxembourg government.</p><p>Jordan immediately wrote to tax commissioners around the world to organise a coordinated response to the revelations.</p><p>When the Panama Paper story broke on April 2 this year, Jordan was immediately on the front foot, revealing that more than 800 Australians on earlier Mossack Fonseca lists were under investigation.</p><p>Four days later he used his position as chairman of the FTA's working body, the Joint International Tax Shelter Information and Collaboration Network, to call a meeting of tax officials from 35 countries to share information and coordinate a response to the Mossack Fonseca documents.</p><p>That's how he came to be giving an interview on April 11 about the links of Panama Papers-named Australians to serious crime. The task force that was set up in Paris the next day was a scaled-up version of his earlier model to target tech companies.</p><p>Before the Senate Estimates Committee in February, Jordan gave his extraordinarily blunt \"enough is enough\" speech.</p><p>\"The excuses we sometimes hear from these companies are, frankly, over the top,\" he said, appearing to refer to tech companies and other big corporates.</p><p>\"Their clear tactic is to delay and obstruct. They game the system ... These companies have pushed the envelope on reasonableness. They play games.</p><p>They string us along. They believe we can be stooged.</p><p>However, enough is enough and no more of this.\"</p><p>It's a message that resonates across both sides of politics, feeding into a worldwide public response against multinational companies that pay no tax.</p><p>\"I will not stand by and admire the problem,\" Jordan told a hastily reconvened tax inquiry last month.</p><p>In this age of regulators, Jordan is not just on to it.</p><p>He's disappearing around the corner.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-6qcth1754e8aaj9kn8f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K5V-JFN1-F0J6-J4YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1156\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Arndt</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The word \"patient\" is rapidly fading from the healthcare lexicon. Nowadays, healthcare executives sound like those from any other industry, talking about \"consumers\" or even \"customers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With consumer-friendly companies like Apple and Amazon nipping at the heels of traditional healthcare organizations, not to mention the rise in out-of-pocket expenses, the consumer is inching toward center stage in healthcare. Leaders are responding with efforts to create more seamless and convenient healthcare experiences. They're starting to notice that consumerism matters. That's reflected in how they're using technology, innovative thinking and hiring. Healthcare CEOs see consumerism transforming the industry and are looking for tools to navigate that change, according to Modern Healthcare's most recent Power Panel survey of 75 top CEOs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But saying an organization is consumer-focused isn't enough. It's about executing a real strategy, whether that's driving patients to lower-acuity settings or turning mobile devices into health management tools. In general, the CEOs saw investment in technology and new ways of conducting their business speeding up, with none saying that innovation is slowing down and only a few saying that it's staying the same.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Catering to consumers</p><p>\"Consumerism is playing a major role in innovation as we see more and more lower-acuity care options go digital or go to lower acuity settings, such as urgent care,\" said Ochsner Health System CEO Warner Thomas.</p><p>One of those digital options is telemedicine. As reimbursement opportunities grow and consumers learn to shop more effectively for care, virtual interactions with the healthcare system are becoming more common. Medicare fee-for-service telemedicine volume has been on the rise, with coding instances up 28% between 2015 and 2016. Medicare Part B telehealth reimbursements totaled $28.7 million in 2016 .</p><p>\"It's been a huge opportunity for us in care delivery to minimize the amount of travel and the out-of-pocket costs,\" Marshfield Clinic Health System CEO Dr. Susan Turney said. The Marshfield health plan covers telemedicine services, and Turney expects other insurers will soon do the same. \"We all know that a hospital is an expensive place to provide care,\" she said.</p><p>The move to more virtual care goes hand in hand with the rise of mobile devices. Many patients now want to receive care via those devices, Turney said.</p><p>More than two-thirds of survey respondents said mobile devices have the most potential of various technologies to drive innovation in the next year. And just under half said telehealth will drive innovation the most.</p><p>Meanwhile, healthcare organizations are starting to compete with consumer giants. Apple launched a new version of its Health app early this year that lets patients of certain providers download their health records to their iPhones. And just before that, Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase announced they're teaming up to form a healthcare company, although few details have emerged.</p><p>Amazon also recently hired a former Food and Drug Administration chief health informatics officer to work on healthcare business development. And then there's continued push from retail clinics like CVS Health and Walgreens further into the traditional provider space.</p><p>\"When you have new entrants into the market that are known for their disruption and innovation, and have virtually zero limitations from a resource perspective, you have to take notice,\" Turney said. \"I think it's exciting. I think we're going to see changes.\"</p><p>Inching towards AI</p><p>One consumer tech company that's been noticeably quieter in healthcare is Alphabet, though the company, which became Google's parent company in 2015 through a corporate restructuring, is poised to make a splash with artificial intelligence. The company's DeepMind AI subsidiary has been working on detecting kidney injuries, for instance, and its data analytics subsidiary Verily is developing algorithmic retinopathy detection.</p><p>\"The next wave of innovation around AI and predictive analytics is going to be very powerful in its impact on the healthcare industry,\" Ochsner's Thomas said.</p><p>In general, AI is just as promising as telehealth, according to the respondents, just under half of whom said AI has the most potential to drive innovation in the coming year. Nearly one-third also called AI integration into electronic health records the most innovative development of the past year, putting it in front of giving patients ways to aggregate their own medical data (25%), the Veterans Affairs and Defense departments' push for interoperability (2.8%), and the CMS' MyHealthEData initiative (0%).</p><p>\"I don't think AI is something for the future-it's happening today,\" Thomas said. \"Its impact and scale will increase in the future.\" His organization is using AI to predict patient deterioration in some units outside of intensive care. During a pilot program in those units, there's been a 44% reduction in adverse events.</p><p>\"With all the information we have in our EHR, and with more and more information about our patients, the ability to be much more predictive is a reality,\" Thomas said.</p><p>Other health systems aren't as far along, but they're still beginning to tap AI for its predictive powers. \"We're just scratching the surface of what opportunity exists for AI,\" Turney said. Marshfield has some machine-learning-based clinical decision-support tools.</p><p>Driving innovation from the inside ...</p><p>The majority of respondents said their boards regularly discuss innovation, and the majority also have an executive in charge of innovation. Reporting structures vary, with 8% reporting to the chief operating officer and 36% to the CEO, according to a recent survey of chief innovation officers at the 40 largest healthcare systems by revenue in the U.S.</p><p>Though 83% of respondents to Modern Healthcare's survey said they saw innovation picking up over the past year, there are still barriers-namely, culture, which 69% cited as the biggest threat or challenge to innovation.</p><p>\"Having someone responsible for innovation in one's organization is very important, but it's really a multifaceted, multidisciplinary approach that's needed,\" Turney said.</p><p>Some organizations get stuck in their ways because that's more comfortable, said Cambia Health Solutions CEO Mark Ganz. \" 'We had a great year last year' is one of the big excuses,\" he said. \"Frankly, it's hard. It gets really scary when you get to your actual revenue model and the path forward tells you that you have to put that at risk to make the leap.\" That's why, he added, innovation often sounds a lot bigger than it turns out to be.</p><p>To make truly important innovations, health systems must listen to their customers, Ganz said. They must do what Uber and Lyft have done and figure out what consumers can't even articulate wanting. \"The only real way to understand what consumers want is to go into the field and ask them directly,\" he said.</p><p>They might also look beyond digital tools alone, said Indiana University Health CEO Dennis Murphy. \"Everybody thinks the only way you can innovate is to have some technological advance,\" he said. \"We're finding a lot of innovations can occur without the use of technology but with changing the team and changing the thinking.\"</p><p>... and from the outside</p><p>Besides culture, respondents also said federal regulations are getting in the way of innovation. But that doesn't mean the government can't help, some respondents said.</p><p>\"The government can play a huge role by creating financial incentives to develop and adopt digital solutions,\" Turney said. \"The government can really help us strike a balance of not encumbering innovation but still maintaining a very safe environment.\"</p><p>Half of the respondents agreed with her, saying that the best way for the government to encourage digital innovation is to offer financial incentives to develop and use digital tools. It's already done that, notably with the EHR incentive program, which paid out more than $30 billion to Medicare and Medicaid providers for adopting electronic record systems.</p><p>But half the respondents also said that federal regulations are the biggest threat or challenge to innovation.</p><p>For example, though Medicare recently expanded coverage for virtual visits, there's been slow progress in getting Medicare to pay for more telemedicine services, said Cathy Jacobson, CEO of Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin. \"The government's role is to remove the barriers,\" she said.</p><p>The federal government might also help by setting standards, such as uniform insurance and billing forms, Jacobson said, as well as other technical standards. \"We still have EHRs that can't talk to each other because we haven't set the standards to make that happen,\" she said.</p><p>Which brings things back to consumer technology companies. \"You are going to see the big tech companies get some way for patients to own and house their own records,\" she said. \"They're going to do that no matter what.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MHC-4726654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MHC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SD5-CCP1-DYFH-V1HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8291</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Crain Communications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Modern Healthcare</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23764\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 48</volume><edition>Print Version</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 21, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Scientific Materials</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Investors are bracing for a split Congress, with Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and Republicans holding their advantage in the Senate, but are mindful that President Donald Trump's victory in 2016 surprised experts. Taking a majority in even one of the chambers in the Nov. 6 elections would give Democrats a chance to more effectively oppose the Republican president's agenda. </p><p>With tech leading the way in the Wall Street rally since Trump's victory, here is a look at policies and stocks the elections should put in focus: GRAPHIC: Soaring stock sectors since Trump elected - https://tmsnrt.rs/2P1Gm9n HEALTHCARE POLICY: Perhaps no sector will be in the election spotlight as much as healthcare, which has been one of the top-performing S&amp;P 500 sectors this year. Policy efforts to lower prescription drug prices that have started under Trump could get more attention should Democrats gain control in Congress. Democratic gains in particular could lead investors to anticipate expanded coverage or other changes related to the Affordable Care Act, possibly benefiting some insurer company and hospital shares. Stocks to watch: Merck , AbbVie , Amgen , Mylan , CVS Health , Anthem , Centene , HCA Healthcare , Tenet Healthcare GRAPHIC: Healthcare's run, from election to election - https://tmsnrt.rs/2CQkHtn TRADE: Concerns over trade tensions between the United States and other countries, especially China, have roughed up manufacturers and other companies that depend on international markets, weighing in particular on the industrial sector. One way the elections could be a factor: Trump's newly forged pact with Canada and Mexico is not expected to be voted on until after the new Congress is seated in January, and there remains a possibility that it will not be approved if Democrats gain control of the House. \"We think headline risk is likely in early 2019 around possible NAFTA withdrawal that will be harmful to industries dependent on open trade across North America,\" according to Height Capital Markets. Stocks to watch: Caterpillar , Boeing , Ford , General Motors , Bunge , DowDuPont INFRASTRUCTURE: A boost in federal infrastructure spending on bridges, roads and other projects is one Trump agenda item seen as an initiative that Democrats potentially could support, should the two sides seek common ground in the event of Democratic gains in Congress, potentially boosting construction and materials stocks.   The Democrats will have to balance the benefits of a real boost to infrastructure spending and the political risks of giving the president a win on that,  said Christopher Smart, head of macroeconomic and geopolitical research at Barings. Stocks to watch: Granite Construction , Fluor , Nucor , Martin Marietta Materials TECH AND TELECOM OVERSIGHT: Scrutiny on Big Tech over antitrust and data privacy issues could pick up with Democrats leading the House, although \"we do not foresee this scrutiny translating into actual policy,\" according to Height Capital Markets. That could spell more volatility for tech stocks, which have been the best performing sector since Trump's election but have been battered in recent weeks. \"We see the Democratic party no longer as the unconditional defender of the tech sector,\" Capital Alpha Partners said in a September report. Height Capital analysts also see \"headline risk\" for telecom companies from any efforts by the House to address regulations related to equality on the internet, known as \"net neutrality,\" although the analysts see little risk of policy change if the Senate stays Republican. Stocks to watch: Alphabet , Facebook , Amazon , Twitter , Verizon , AT&amp;T GRAPHIC: Taking stock of industry performance since Trump - https://tmsnrt.rs/2OZZQuR REGULATION: If Republicans maintain their hold on both chambers of Congress, or perhaps expand their advantage, that could lift investors' hopes for further deregulation of the financial industry and give a boost to stocks. With Democratic gains, \"headline risk for the banking industry would significantly increase as we anticipate numerous congressional hearings,\" according to analysts at Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods. Stocks to watch: JP Morgan , Wells Fargo , Goldman Sachs DEFENSE: Spending on national defense is one area that could come into focus for potential federal cuts, especially if Democrats make strong gains. \"A Republican surprise might well be helpful for defense stocks in the near term,\" said Smart of Barings, adding that the near-term \"expectation will be more tax cuts and fewer defense cuts.\" Stocks to watch: Lockheed Martin , Raytheon , Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics IMMIGRATION: Should Republicans hold control of Congress, that could create expectations for harsher federal policies on immigration. Such policies would also spark expectations for expansion of demand for detention center space, potentially helping to fill prison operators' idle facilities or even generating the need for new ones. Stocks to watch: CoreCivic , Geo Group GUN CONTROL: Democratic gains in Congress could pave the way for calls for more stringent legislation to control gun sales. But the prospect of stricter regulations on the firearms industry, paradoxically, could drive up shares of gun-makers. Investors in the past have bid up shares of gun companies in anticipation of tougher rules, because investors predict gun owners will hurry to buy more firearms if they worry about impending restrictions. Indeed, gun stocks have struggled since Trump's election, a time in which control of Congress and the federal government has been held by Republicans, who are seen as resistant to stricter laws.

The only time President Donald Trump seems to offer praise to the Valley is when tech giants hit the trillion-dollar valuation mark. As for the average Joe or Joanne, they like their tech, but fewer of them really trust the companies that make it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leave it, then, to a veteran journalist to come to town and give Silicon Valley business, community and government leaders a pep talk.</p><p>\"Technology is a tool, of course,\" Dan Rather said at the annual State of the Valley conference on February 14. Rather went on to say that the Valley had created \"the most powerful tools ever imagined by the human mind. They can and must be harnessed for good. And, yes, I believe you are the ones who can do it.\"</p><p>Rather, the 88-year-old newsman best known for succeeding Walter Cronkite as anchor of CBS Evening News, avoided making direct references to Trump or any of the people running to replace him. But he did make it clear how he felt about today's political climate.</p><p>\"I see a deep danger in our current leadership. I do not consider this to be a strictly political judgment. We can and should debate our tax policies. We can and should debate how we structure healthcare and our regulatory system. That's the American way. But we shouldn't debate hard facts and truth,\" Rather said, taking aim at corruption, climate crisis-deniers and hardline voices against immigration.</p><p>Rather described this time period as \"chaotic and uncertain, a moment of great challenge and risk ... And the truth is, that the world has serious problems and that technology of Silicon Valley has helped to contribute to some of that, and even more importantly, can help also to be a solution.\"</p><p>A social media star in his own right - he has 873,000 followers on Twitter and 76,500 followers on Instagram - Rather said he's realized that technology advances far faster than humans do.</p><p>\"The way we share information has elements that are unlocking dreams and talent, but other elements that are spreading dangerous propaganda,\" he said, sending a specific message to journalists and media companies.</p><p>For Silicon Valley, Rather said he still saw \"sunny optimism and idealism, a belief - a deep belief - that technology can improve the human condition.\" But he also said we need to remind ourselves that while change is an integral part of the American experience, \"we're not great at everything.\"</p><p>\"Silicon Valley should be a place that shows the promise of science and data and dreaming big. It should be a place that understands its disruptive role and seeks to disrupt that which needs to be disrupted, while protecting the core values like diversity and truth,\" he said. \"I submit to you that the Silicon Valley must be a place of hope. The nation turns to you, yes still turns to you, not just to distract and entertain, but to enlighten and to inform.\"</p><p>For a time in 1986, five years into his 24-year run leading CBS' main newscast, Rather ended the program with an odd sign off. It was a single word, \"courage,\" and it was widely mocked. Needless to say, it didn't last long.</p><p>Yet, I think that's the message Rather tried to impart to Silicon Valley during his Valentine's Day speech. We need to have courage to keep innovating. We need to have courage to admit when we've gone too far. And, as Rather paraphrased the journalist H.L. Mencken, we need to have courage to fight against \"ignorance, intolerance and indifference.\"</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Here are my picks for the story lines to watch in the coming year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The war on Big Tech gets real: Don't count on the scrutiny surrounding the tech industry - especially the influence and tactics of social media - to ease up. In fact, watch for Congress to get even more aggressive with its questioning of Facebook, Inc., Google, Twitter, Inc. and others. Democrats, who will control the House in the next Congress, may not care about Republican claims of political bias, but they do care about continued reports that users' privacy is being invaded. Forcing these companies to become public utilities, as some have suggested, likely won't become a serious effort but legislation restricting what information they can share with third parties is a real possibility. It might just be one of the few things House Democrats, Senate Republicans and the Trump administration can agree on.</p><p>Driverless cars become a real presence on Silicon Valley streets: Alphabet Inc.-owned Waymo, which secured the first driverless vehicle permit in California in October, should start to test cars in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto. Waymo won't be the only such cars on the road: In the second half of 2019, Mercedes-Benz models will hit the streets in San Jose as part of a mostly autonomous taxi service\u00a0that's a trial program between Mercedes owner Daimler AG, German tech company Bosch and the city of San Jose. They'll give us all a real-world look at an industry that's become one of the Valley's more innovative economic drivers.</p><p>The 5G era begins: For the last several years, we've been told far and wide that 5G is coming. In 2019, the fifth generation of mobile cellular tech arrives. The city of San Jose has made adoption of 5G a key part of its smart city efforts. AT&amp;T will be the first major provider to bring 5G to the region and has said it would start the service in both San Jose and San Francisco in the first part of the new year. Pushing all the hype aside, will this new tech be a game changer? According to most experts, the answer is a clear yes: The global impact of 5G technology will hit $12 trillion by 2035. That kind of money will have a big influence on work done here for autonomous cars, artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and more.</p><p>The economy will stumble: We're already seeing signs of a national economic slowdown, and that's all but guaranteed to continue in the new year. The word \"recession\" is getting thrown around right and left, with many economists believing we'll fall into one in 2019. That kind of a correction after the heavy gains the economy has sustained over the last several years is natural. The real question is how long and how hard will it be. The good news is that we're not looking at the kind of dot-com bust that shook Silicon Valley to its core nearly two decades ago or the Great Recession that smacked the entire country a decade ago. One other positive note: A <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-to-remain-worlds-largest-urban-economy-with-san-jose-the-uss-fastest-growing-report-2018-12-18\">new report from Oxford Economics</url> says San Jose will have the fastest-growing economy in the United States through 2035.</p><p>Outward migration keeps moving on: One of the big story lines of 2018 was that some companies and people had enough with the Bay Area and were leaving, not just the region, but the state. This outward migration trend will only continue in the new year as housing stock hasn't kept up with demand, housing prices remain oppressive, repressive business regulation is an ongoing challenge and a push to add new taxes to companies will have a few of them thinking either of relocating entirely or establishing more satellite offices. We're not yet at a tipping point where this should be a major cause for concern, but if any of the region's corporate giants were to decide they were finished here, the narrative would quickly change.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

What is different is that Silicon Valley is getting hit from all sides now. Just look at these headlines, all of which were published this week, and you'll see a trend:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\" Conservatives, liberals unite against Silicon Valley\" - Politico</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\" There's blood in the water in Silicon Valley\" - BuzzFeed</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>\" How Silicon Valley is erasing your individuality\" - The Washington Post</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>And the piling on isn't just happening on home turf. Here's a headline from the U.K.-based The Telegraph - <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2017/09/13/government-signals-end-tech-utopia-silicon-valley-giants/\">\"Government signals end to 'tech utopia' for Silicon Valley giants\"</url>- with the government in question being that of British Prime Minister <person><nameText>Theresa May.</nameText></person></p><p>Several factors are at play for this anti-Valley hostility, not the least of which are critics in the media. Tucker Carlson, the Fox News prime time host who also runs the conservative news site the Daily Caller, is on a crusade to treat Google as a public utility. Normally one who abhors government regulation of business, Carlson openly is calling for Washington to step in and regulate this one company.</p><p>\"Google seems to be letting politics dictate who is allowed to make money from their platform,\" Carlson charged during one Fox News broadcast last week.</p><p>Plenty of people in the Valley will no doubt brush off Carlson as just another right-wing pundit angry at the tech industry's liberal political tendencies. But these are the same people who should be concerned about another media voice that's harder for them to dismiss - Franklin Foer, a staff writer for the The Atlantic and a former New Republic editor-in-chief who has written the new book \" <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.amazon.com/World-Without-Mind-Existential-Threat/dp/1101981113\">World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech</url>.\"</p><p>\"It's hard not to marvel at these companies and their inventions, which often make life infinitely easier,\" Foer wrote in a column in The Washington Post (the one with the \"erasing your individuality\" headline mentioned above.) \"But we've spent too long marveling. The time has arrived to consider the consequences of these monopolies, to reassert our role in determining the human path.\"</p><p>Tech giants don't like to think of themselves as monopolies. They prefer to cast themselves as dynamic, multifaceted corporations aimed at making our lives more productive and entertaining. But they're also highly competitive, acquiring smaller startups that have technology they covet and becoming aggressive competitors against bigger companies that operate in a sliver of their universe.</p><p>If they haven't already, these Silicon Valley powerhouses should start preparing for an aggressive push from a Washington administration that loathes regulations and a media landscape that's starting to seriously question how they do business.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

It's unfortunate that in 2017, it takes women five fiscal quarters to earn what men make in four.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The detailed stats on this are distressing. The 20 percent, on average, pay gap between the sexes gets worse as you factor in elements of race and ethnicity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Join the conversation: Follow</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"http://twitter.com/SVbizjournal\">@SVbizjournal</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">on Twitter, \"Like\" us on</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/SVBizjournal/\">Facebook</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and</emphasis>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/promo/sanjose-ampm\">sign up for our free email newsletters.</url><br/></p><p>Perhaps the most unsettling part is that this remains a big story. Yes, it's gotten better over the years - in 1980, women made about 60 percent of what men made. But couldn't the disparity have been wiped out over more than three decades?</p><p>Some politicians have tried to get government involved. The first piece of legislation former President Barack Obama signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 that made it easier to file equal pay lawsuits.</p><p>In contrast, President Donald Trump last week revoked an Obama executive order from 2014 that, in part, helped women who worked for federal contractors in pay matters. Trump has said he believes in equal pay for equal work, though he's also on a crusade to reduce government regulations on business.</p><p>The involvement of Washington lawmakers wouldn't be needed if corporate executives and business owners would do one simple thing - commit to fixing the imbalance.</p><p>A number of big tech companies - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft - last year reported they had achieved near-parity on pay. At Apple, for example, CEO Tim Cook said female employees made 99.6 cents for every dollar a male employee made.</p><p>This week, Salesforce spent $3 million to help close the wage gap in its workforce. It spent the same amount last year.</p><p>\"The need for another adjustment underscores the nature of pay equity - it is a moving target, especially for growing companies in competitive industries. It must be consistently monitored and addressed,\" Salesforce executive vice president Cindy Robbins said in a statement.</p><p>Yes, this is good PR for companies. But more importantly, it's absolutely the right action to take. Every CEO, COO, CFO, and human resources VP needs to go through their company's payroll numbers, find where the disparities occur and fix them.</p><p>If that happens, then maybe in 2018, Equal Pay Day will fall sometime in March. And perhaps, if there's real executive leadership, Equal Pay Day will disappear long before 2152 - the year analysts predict the gap will disappear.</p><p>Graphic: How men and women differ in paycheck equality</p><p>A series of recent studies show the depth of the wage gap.</p><p>In one analysis from the Silicon Valley Institute for Regional Studies, women earned 74 cents for every dollar a man made, according to 2015 data. That was the same as the national figure, but worse than either San Francisco's 77 cents or California's 79 cents. One disturbing footnote: The higher degree of education a woman had, the greater disparity.</p><p>Hired.com explored the wage issue a couple of other ways. Rather than just looking at the male-female gap, it also factored in race and ethnicity. White, Asian and Latino men earned more than all women, but white women earned more than black men and black women trailed everyone.</p><p>Check out the graphic for more data from Hired.com that looks at what happens when men and women ask employers for more money.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?
