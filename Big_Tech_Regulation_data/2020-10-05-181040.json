These log files could only be accessed by Monzo engineers and were stored for up to six months in this location. Monzo became aware of the PIN breach on Friday and rolled out an update to the app the following day. By Monday it had deleted the incorrectly stored data and sent an email to those affected asking them to change their PIN. </p><p>Monzo also recommends that customers update to the latest version of the app. Monzo said that nobody outside of the bank had access to the PINs and that there is no evidence that the information has been used to commit fraud. \"We've checked all the accounts that have been affected by this bug thoroughly, and confirmed the information hasn't been used to commit fraud,\" Monzo said in a blog post. \"Just in case, we've messaged everyone that's been affected to let them know they should change their PIN by going to a cash machine.\" Jake Moore, cybersecurity specialist at ESET, said: \"If a bank tells you to change your PIN then things are not going very well. In an ideal world, not even the engineers should have had access to the codes, which would have mitigated this problem. \"But then again, like any breach, most never think it will ever happen. Obviously, changing your PIN number is advised, but if all of your cards use the same PIN, it would be best practice to change them too - just like in a password breach.\" Did the Monzo PIN error breach GDPR?Monzo appears to have reported the breach to the Information Commissioner's Office, the UK's data regulator, within the 72 hour period stipulated under the General Data Protection Regulation. The ICO told the Financial Times: \"We are aware of an incident involving Monzo and we will be assessing the matter.\" Robert Wassall, director of legal services for cybersecurity firm ThinkMarble, told Verdict that the Monzo PIN breach is something the ICO would \"likely be very concerned about\" because it involves a financial institution. Wassall pointed out that 500,000 customers is a similar number of people compromised in the British Airways breach, for which the ICO recently levied a record \u00a3183m GDPR fine.\u00a0BA fell victim to a cyberattack in which hackers stole payment details from the company's website. The airline fell afoul of the 'Breach of Principle of Integrity and confidentiality', a key GDPR principle that requires organisations to uphold appropriate technical and organisational measures to process personal data securely. Wassall said that the Monzo PIN breach would likely fall under the same principle. In a May blog post, information commissioner Elizabeth Denham said the ICO would be focusing on this principle for the second half of 2019: \"Organisations need to shift their focus to accountability with a real evidenced understanding of the risks to individuals in the way they process data and how those risks should be mitigated,\" she wrote. Jasmit Sagoo, senior director, head of technology UK &amp; Ireland at Veritas, an enterprise data protection firm, said: \"Poor data hygiene is bad for business, threatening the foundation of the customer relationship and the organisation itself. \"Leaving data disorganised also makes it vulnerable, opening it up to potential bad actors and exponentially increasing the chances of a highly damaging data breach. Sensitive customer information -bank details or home addresses - is then ripe for the taking if poorly protected. \"Good data hygiene is not easy to achieve, but it's increasingly necessary. To compete in a marketplace where trust is a valued commodity, businesses must prove they are responsible with customer data and meet their data requirements.\" The Monzo PIN breach comes at a time when the bank is looking to expand into the US. The bank, which has no physical branches, is currently valued at \u00a32bn.

But when the company's first-quarter numbers came in a little light on Thursday afternoon, its stock immediately plummeted.&amp; Colin Gillis of BGC Partners told the paper: &amp; There's nothing wrong with this company. They spent a bit more and took in a bit less than we thought, so Mr Market is having a mood swing. But it was a fine quarter.&amp; Something similar happened over at Microsoft, which also announced its results last month. In a harsh environment Microsoft had pretty solid earnings, despite the PC market - where Microsoft has traditionally made all its money - declining by 9%, which dragged chipmaker Intel's market cap down. Its revenue fell to $20.53bn from $21.73bn the year before, which, granted, doesn't look good.</p><p>But considering that the largest maker of software has managed to reinvent itself as a cloud-service provider, second only to Amazon, you'd expect a little goodwill from Wall Street.</p><p>Twitter is in the same boat. The results it announced last month were up 36% year on year to $595m, but missed the Wall Street average expectation of $607.8m. That's a $12.8m difference. The number of its users, which dropped 2m in the previous quarter to 305m, bounced up to 310m. Still, it lost 14% in after-hours trading.</p><p>&amp; Here's a company that makes $500m a quarter on 140-character messages, and it's considered an abject failure by Wall Street,&amp; author Douglas Rushkoff told me at the South by Southwest conference in Austin, Texas, in March.</p><p>This was based on Twitter's revenue of $710m in the last quarter of 2015, which, by the way, was an increase of 90% over the previous year's quarter.</p><p>&amp; Twitter's mistake was selling itself to venture capital and then selling itself to Wall Street in an IPO. That's because those investors want to make a hundred times, a thousand times, on their investment,&amp; he said.</p><p>And it will get worse, he added.</p><p>&amp; The problem is that Twitter will now have to sacrifice the quality of what it's doing, that Twitter is going to have to destroy itself on some level to try to extract more value from its marketplace.</p><p>&amp; The tragedy is that a $500m-a-quarter business is a failure; that it can't stay on.&amp; Wall Street is a cruel beast and its obsession with quarterly growth is killing the companies listed on it.</p><p>It is also in danger of killing the innovation these companies have become recognised for.</p><p>In the past, only Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Amazon chief Jeff Bezos were able to thumb their nose at these unrealistic growth expectations. But now even Apple's share price has fallen to earth, as its unprecedented 13-year run of quarter growth has come to an end.</p><p>Amazon, which generally tends to plough its profits back into growing its various businesses, unusually declared a profit, raking in $29.13bn revenue compared with $22.72bn the previous year.</p><p>A not insignificant portion of that comes from its cloud-computing business - a chunk of which was developed in Cape Town, in case you don't know - and not the lean margins of the e-commerce online store that it is mostly known for.</p><p>The problem isn't the performance of these big tech firms but Wall Street's unrealistic expectations of what their growth should be.</p><p>Simply put, Wall Street is the problem.</p><p>Shapshak is editor-in-chief and publisher of Stuff magazine (stuff.co.za).Follow him on Twitter: @shapshak</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLFM-FMfmFM1205cov1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLFM2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JS4-SJY1-DYT4-K018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"681\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Proceeds from the offering will go towards general corporate purposes, including the possible repayment of outstanding debt and eligible green and social projects. </p><p>Moody's said the rating reflect's Alphabet's \"position as the world's leading Internet search engine and digital advertising facilitator through its varied Google and other properties, and its significant and growing positions in Cloud services, mobile operating systems, online video, consumer hardware and autonomous driving technology, among others.\"</p><p>The credit ratings agency said Alphabet has \"extremely strong cash flow capability and credit measures\" that are consistent with and possibly exceed its Aa2 debt ratings.</p><p>In financial 2019, Alphabet had free cash flow generation of around USD31 billion, and about USD121 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities compared to reported debt of USD4.0 billion. </p><p>\"While Alphabet currently has very modest leverage (0.5 times adjusted debt to [earnings before, interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisaton]), the Aa2 rating factors in the possibility that, over time, debt could rise producing debt to EBITDA of up to about 1.0 times (using Moody's standard adjustments),\" said Moody's.</p><p>The ratings agency highlighted Alphabet's most significant social risks as stemming from \"regulatory challenges\" to its strong market position and business practises and said that this \"has long been the primary concern and risk for Alphabet's credit standing.\"</p><p>\"These challenges could impede Alphabet's core segment expansion. The company has accrued over USD9 billion in fines by the European Commission related to various decisions finding that Google infringed European competition law. The company has appealed the fines,\" Moody's said. </p><p>Moody's pointed to the \"broad and bipartisan shift in tone from US regulators, lawmakers and presidential candidates\" when it comes to \"Big Tech\" companies like Amazon Inc, Apple Inc, and Alphabet. This has resulted in \"a broad bipartisan investigation into potential antitrust law violations by Google\".</p><p>Alphabet's stable outlook, Moody's said, reflects an expectation that the company will maintain its market position within desktop and mobile search and display advertising and includes the expectation for its \"very liquid and mildly levered balance sheet\" to be maintained.</p><p>The rating might be upgraded if \"management commits to maintaining financial policies that are consistent with a higher credit rating\" while a downgrade could occur if \"there is deterioration or regulatory interference in the company's core business model\" resulting in erosion of profitability, cash flow generation, and market positions.</p><p>Class 'A' Alphabet shares were down 0.5% at USD1,481.00 on Monday in New York, while its 'C' class shares were down 0.7% at USD1,473.38.</p><p>By Anna Farley;

In response, financial firms will accelerate digitalization efforts as online ecosystems already controlled by large global technology businesses grow further.  Moody's examines how this growth will affect incumbent financial firms, including banks, insurers, asset managers and brokers. </p><p>In a central scenario, these firms will cede a portion of their control over the distribution of retail financial services despite efforts to increase their presence on digital platforms. In an alternate scenario, big tech firms would control a larger share of distribution and manufacturing, eventually leading to the displacement of a number of financial incumbents, particularly those that fail to execute timely and comprehensive digital strategies.  User experience has become the primary factor in retaining and acquiring new customers, and will play a key role in determining where and how consumers will access their financial needs. Losing control over a portion of customer relationships, which is credit negative to financial firms, stems from big tech companies expanding distribution and inclusion of retail financial services within their ecosystems. Initially, the provision of these services will likely be done in partnerships with financial incumbents.  \"Big tech companies have an advantage over financial firms since they have significant experience in optimizing customers' user experience and have been able to grow their market share in part because consumers find their products add value, are easy and convenient to use, and have increasingly compelling digital ecosystems.\" according to Moody's Vice President Stephen Tu, one of the authors of the report  \"Through innovation, tech companies can provide value in financial services in entirely new ways,\" says Warren Kornfeld, a Moody's senior vice president and co-author of the report. \"This is accomplished by offering fresh capabilities through aggregation and customization of products, services and offerings, and through large-scale networks or digital communities.\"  However, while well-known big tech firms are potential sources of competition in retail financial services, they are likely to avoid manufacturing financial products due to regulatory burdens.  Though steering clear of directly manufacturing financial products such as deposits and lending, big tech will continue to expand in the distribution and inclusion of financial services in their ecosystems, which could lead to big tech controlling a large portion of the consumer relationship. Thus, turning a portion of financial firms primarily into manufacturers.

With us today we are honored to have Ray McDaniel, the CEO of Moody's Corporation. Ray started at Moody's back in 1987 as a credit analyst and has been the CEO of the Company since 2005. And I was looking it up -- when you became CEO back in April 2005 the stock was at about $40 and as of yesterday the close was above $100, an all-time high. So congratulations on that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAY MCDANIEL, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, MOODY'S CORPORATION: It hasn't been a completely straight line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BILL WARMINGTON: Fair point, fair point. Now, Ray, even though I think everybody in this room is familiar with -- from Moody's from a rating agencies standpoint, I think it might be helpful just to spend a couple of minutes to talk about all of Moody's product lines. So think of a quick overview to level set.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Sure. And you are right, most people, when I mention Moody's, they think of rating agency. And the rating agency does comprise about two-thirds of our total business, total revenue and a more significant component of our operating income.</p><p>But the other third of the business is in its own right a -- about a $1 billion business and that is Moody's Analytics, which is comprised of three reporting units, one called research, data and analytics; the other is enterprise risk solutions; and then we have a professional service business, provides training, credit-rating services, certification, things of that sort.</p><p>The enterprise risk solutions business is a business which develops risk management and risk measurement models for financial institutions around the world. That business has been growing very nicely. And it is really meeting a number of demands, many of them coming from regulators looking at the adequacy of bank capital, stress testing solutions, processes around stress testing reporting, things of that sort.</p><p>And then as a -- working back up the ladder to the research data and analytics unit, we publish a vast amount of commentary, credit and economic commentary, as well as data sources, a lot of proprietary data that we make available to the markets in that unit.</p><p>So that is a quick overview of the Moody's Analytics business and, as compared to the rating agency, which has our four reporting units that I think people are generally familiar with: corporate finance rating; structured finance; public project and infrastructure finance; and financial institutions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Perfect, thank you. Now let's talk about China for a moment. On Monday you were in China, you were giving a speech at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO Summit -- make sure I read that correctly. And I wanted to ask what kind of an opportunity China presents for Moody's?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: It presents I will call it an interesting opportunity and hopefully a significant opportunity. China's domestic bond markets are developing. They've been expanding that market in a reasonably significant way over the last decade or so. But it is still a market which is very heavily bank financed.</p><p>And so the process that we have talked about, you and I have talked about in other forums, of disintermediation is in its early stages in China. So that domestic market opportunity we think could be very significant over time.</p><p>The reason I say the Chinese opportunity is interesting is right now that market is not open to Moody's to operate as a domestic rating agency, so we operate in a joint venture, we watch that market and talk with policymakers about the likely timing and extent of a market opening and access to the country.</p><p>It is part -- as most of you will already well know, it is part of a much broader dialogue going on on both a bilateral basis and a multilateral basis in terms of the access to the country, access to markets in the country by a variety of industries, including the financial services industry, but really many industries.</p><p>And then in addition to that we have a good cross-border business where we provide credit ratings for the largest Chinese entities that are accessing the debt markets in the United States, the Euro market. And we have about 160 rated companies and state owned enterprises that have already established rating relationships with Moody's as part of that cross-border exercise.</p><p>And then the last component is we do provide professional services and risk management software through our Moody's Analytics business to some of the largest Chinese financial institutions.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Got you. So how does that market evolve then? When does it evolve to a point where it can support actionable third-party ratings? I mean I have heard you talk in the past you will draw a parallel with the Japanese market.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes. And this is one of several very critical questions in trying to judge the market opportunity in China, because to date there have been very few bonds that have been permitted to default. The model has been that there has been support either from municipalities or banks, but there has been institutional support for companies that have distress in the bond market.</p><p>So whether or not as part of the opening of the market and the state council's intention to allow market sources to play a more decisive role, whether that translates into permitting companies that run into credit problems to default on their bonds is a very important question if you are providing bond ratings. If nothing is ever permitted to default the product we have to offer is arguably not very useful.</p><p>And that is where I draw the analogy to Japan, which has experienced almost no bond defaults over the last several decades despite very obvious distress for a large number of companies in that market. But as a matter of managing the market and policy, those distressed credit situations have been absorbed by the banking system and ultimately the tax payers. So we have to see which way the Chinese market develops.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Well, I'm going to go backward in your travels then to last week when you were in London and ask your thoughts on the state of the European financial markets.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Well, I happened to be there at the same time that the European Commission revised -- released some of the revised outlook numbers for the European Union in terms of 2015 outlook, GDP outlook. And there were downward revisions.</p><p>And so the outlook for Europe next year is not one where we would be anticipating a lot of growth. Modest growth is included in the forecast and obviously varies from country to country. The UK is expected to have pretty good growth, certainly on a relative basis, as is Ireland. But some of the big economies, including Germany and France, are expected to be in the very low single-digits, around 1%.</p><p>So it looks as though we are going to be at this point continuing in a very low interest rate environment. The European Central Bank has already taken certain steps, announced certain steps for easing quantitative easing. And that's certainly I think an appropriate position for them to be taking given the expectations.</p><p>But I think it is going to be some time before we see more substantial growth coming out of Europe. I hope it is sooner rather than later. That is obviously good for the global economy if it does happen, but right now the outlook and forecasts are pretty modest.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Well, now, it seems like there is a big opportunity for Moody's in Europe with disintermediation being more of a bank loan market than a bond market. Now is there some potential that that transition is able to accelerate and offset some of that softness?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I don't think -- I would not expect it to accelerate from where it is now. But it has already stepped up over the last few years, really since 2010. And so, the disintermediation has increased in Europe and I would expect it to continue. I don't expect that to fall off. And that is really from a -- from Moody's standpoint that is beneficial in a couple of ways.</p><p>Certainly to the extent that assets are moving from the banking system into the bond market that creates more bonds for us to rate at MIS. And it establishes -- as importantly, it establishes new rating relationships which tend to continue over time.</p><p>Once a relationship is established, once a company is in the bond market, has its name known in the bond market it is often reluctant to lose that additional access to capital and liquidity that the bond market provides.</p><p>In addition, it develops ongoing monitoring fees for us as each year we follow a larger and larger number of companies. So to the extent that a Company asks for a rating and then we establish a monitoring relationship, the recurring revenue base for Moody's will increase accordingly.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Got you. I wanted to get your thoughts on Mario Draghi's stimulus for structured finance and what implications that potentially has for the issuance market.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I'm sorry, for the --?</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: For structured finance, his plans for that market.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Oh, yeah. And as you are aware, we had a strong third-quarter in US structured finance.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Yes.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: And that was really driven by very high activity in the collateralized loan obligation, CLO market. Now, the recovery in structured finance has not been as broad-based as would be ideal, the mortgage-backed securities market is still relatively dormant. And we've seen activity in other areas of asset-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities. But not back to pre-crisis levels by any means.</p><p>And then some parts of the market are being affected by regulation. Certainly the role that Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac are playing in the mortgage market and what that -- the implications for the private label mortgage-backed securities, as well as some additional rules that are coming for CLOs in the next couple of years, you see regulation around that. I'm happy to talk about that.</p><p>But I should shift over and also say that the European securitization market remains very soft. And so, the growth that we've seen and recovery that we've seen in the US has not been replicated in Europe. And it has gotten to the point where I think European policymakers would like to see additional securitization as part of one of a number of things that they think may help restart and generate some economic momentum across the continent broadly.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Got it. Well, we've touched on Asia, we've touched on Europe. I wanted to ask if maybe you could comment on the opportunities for Moody's in emerging markets more broadly -- other than we have touched on Asia and China, but --.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes, the individual emerging markets remain a small part of our business. But when we look at the emerging markets as a collective, yes, it is becoming certainly more important. Business is expanding, not only in Latin America where you would expect it, but we are seeing growth in Middle East, for example, project and infrastructure financing. In Eastern Europe, South and Southeast Asia -- we are really seeing growth in all of these markets. And I would include now Africa and that.</p><p>It is not something I would've mentioned in prior years, but we are starting to see ratings and rating requests coming from sovereigns and financial institutions in Africa. And that is where we would expect it to begin before it moves more broadly out in the corporate sector.</p><p>So I think that is not going to be a significant story for a few years. But it is actually nice to be able to talk about it for the first time and give it a mention. Cyclically I think it is interesting to look at the emerging markets in the context of the potential for -- well, what we've seen and the potential further for the strengthening dollar. And the movement of capital potentially from emerging market opportunities to the dollar.</p><p>We saw that a little over a year ago when the first talk about the taper began and there was a bit of a flight of capital to the dollar. I would expect we would see some of that again if we start to see interest rates increase and as the dollar strengthens. But I don't think that the central scenario is for any kind of panicked flight out of the emerging markets. I think it would be much more moderate at this point.</p><p>I think the markets have adjusted themselves to the expectation that we would have a stronger dollar given that we are ready to embark on some monetary tightening in the United States. But we've got monetary easing going on elsewhere around the world and how that changes the relative attractiveness of currencies.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: I wanted to also ask about the US market, since we have touched around everything else but that, and get your thoughts on the -- three weeks ago it sounded like the pipelines were looking pretty good for much of the US market. I just wanted to see if you had any updated thoughts as we head into the end of the year and into 2015, how you are feeling about issuance levels and the health of the overall market?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes. I mean as we described a few weeks ago, I think we would characterize in the US market the bank loan and spec grade bond pipelines as being average with the investment grade pipeline being good. And interest rates certainly have remained low, no surprises there.</p><p>And I think as we have seen really throughout the last couple of years, almost week to week we have periods of strong activity and then the market goes soft and then strong activity again. And that has continued. So I think the first couple of weeks in October were pretty soft and then it picked up a little as companies moved out of blackout periods and there was a little more stability and perceived stability in the market.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Now the M&amp;A pipeline sounded like it was particularly strong and that there was a lot of activity in that market. And that there was potentially a lot of financing in the wings, if you will, looking to come out.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: And this is one of the areas we would look not only for the fourth quarter but looking out into 2015. If we assume that we are going to have higher rates in 2015, higher official rates, and looking at what that does to refinancing. Well, a lot of refinancing, especially investment grade refinancing, happens on a pretty regular basis as bonds mature. But opportunistic refinancing may hit a soft patch with an increasing rate environment.</p><p>And so, we would look for mergers and acquisition activity, capital expenditure, borrowing for share repurchase, etc., to pick up any slack that we might see in the spec grade opportunistic refi market. That being said, I think that inflation expectations are still relatively modest, that would indicate that even if there is an increasing rate environment it may not be dramatic.</p><p>And the fact that not all economies around the world are moving in the same direction I think is also going to act as a governor on inflation and perhaps give the Fed a little more flexibility in its monetary policy.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: So I wanted to shift and ask some questions on Moody's Analytics. The enterprise risk solutions especially. It just seems like there is a big opportunity there in terms of stress tests. If you go back to 2009 there were what, 19 banks that -- in the US that underwent stress tests.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Now it seems like it's not only gotten big in the US, it has now spread to Europe. And maybe you could talk a little bit about the opportunity that that presents for you guys.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Sure. Well as you know, Europe just completed its stress test --.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: It didn't look good, either.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: It was -- I think it was about as expected, at least about as we expected. But you are right, this does present a very attractive opportunity we think.</p><p>Because regulators, if they are going to permit institutions to pay dividends, to engage in share repurchase, increase dividends or engage in share repurchase, etc., they really want to make sure that at this point they have gotten comfortable with capital adequacy, they have gotten comfortable with risk management practices, that the banks have performed well through the stress testing process.</p><p>And so, this really provides we think a significant demand for something that we believe we are uniquely well-positioned to provide.</p><p>The other thing I would just add to this is it is really initially a lot of the bank customers that we were talking to you were looking for an answer to satisfy a question that was being asked of them. And we expect that as we look forward it is really going to become much more about a process than an answer.</p><p>And this is where having an installed platform that can produce replicable results that are comparative period on period and are understood and accepted by oversight authorities really becomes a very important part of this opportunity.</p><p>We think that we have got a very good product for satisfying all of those demands. And so, that is why we feel so good about this opportunity. And why, as you well know, we have really been pushing the top line, the sales and not trying to stress the near-term profitability of that business.</p><p>Because we think that we are in a period of time where acquiring the sales and making the installations is really the best way for long-term success in this area because it is going to be a very sticky product once it is installed.</p><p>This is something that is installed throughout a financial institution and is meeting its regulatory obligations. So -- we are -- I described it before as being a bit in a land grab phase of this market opportunity.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Do you have any competition there?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes, most of our competition is interestingly not the usual suspects you would see on the ratings side, it is more the big tech firms. And they obviously are well schooled in technology development and design. But so are we in this area.</p><p>We made the acquisition of KMV back in 2002, of Fermat in 2008, Barrie &amp; Hibbert shortly after that. So a group of software development and risk modeling, risk analytics firms that we've been able to integrate and create this more complete platform for risk management, risk measurement.</p><p>And we also have relationships at financial institutions with the risk officers and the risk departments. And we think that that is the more important place for us to -- for anyone to be explaining their product and service in this area as opposed to the technology side of a financial institution.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Agreed, agreed. So let's talk about margins. And you have a high-class problem, you are at close to 43% on the operating margin side, close to 46% on the EBITDA margin side. You are at the high end of the information services peer group, which is already a fairly high margin group compared to the overall market.</p><p>And so my question is, have you started to reach the point at which -- of diminishing returns for margin expansion where it makes sense to start to reinvest some of that incremental profit back into the business? And if so where do you invest?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: We -- in terms of our priorities, reinvesting back into the business is the first priority. So we are not foregoing opportunities in order to achieve margin expansion. Now, if we don't see opportunities we are not going to just push money back into the business for no reason and that would potentially create some margin expansion. And I do believe we still have some margin expansion opportunities over time.</p><p>It is going to be dependent on the mix of our businesses and where we see the investment opportunities. And very specifically, if we are able to grow our Moody's Analytics business at a faster rate than the rating agency business, that is a lower margin business.</p><p>We think it is an attractive business, we think there are margin expansion opportunities in that business specifically. But it is a business that is unlikely to run at the kind of margin that the rating agency runs at. So again, if the growth is faster there that will act as a drag on margin expansion.</p><p>Where do we see the reinvestment of business? Well, recently we haven't made some acquisitions, several of them have been on the Moody's Analytics side, but we also were able to invest in a rating agency in India called ICRA.</p><p>So it is not exclusively Moody's Analytics opportunities, although it has been more weighted on that side historically and, frankly, I would expect it to be more weighted on that side going forward. There just aren't that many rating agencies that are doing something that we aren't already doing (multiple speakers) around the world.</p><p>And so, we -- it means that at the rating agency continuing to enhance the predictive content of our ratings, the quality of our research, the insight that goes into that research, how timely it is -- all of those are important investments to make to protect and grow this very good business that we have.</p><p>On the Moody's Analytics side of the business we have similar opportunities to continue to build out our enterprise risk solutions business and our professional services business. We also look for high-quality content or -- and/or proprietary data that might be suitable for addition to our research data and analytics business.</p><p>So really all three reporting units in the Moody's Analytics business we think present investment opportunities, whether it is organic investment or through acquisition activity.</p><p>The last piece of this I would say is we also have to make sure that we are investing geographically at a pace that makes sense for the markets where we want to operate. There is no point in hiring 100 analysts for a bond market that doesn't exist.</p><p>But we certainly want to be in a position where we are not lagging a market at all and ideally leading it by a bit to help that market develop in a healthy way. And so, I think everyone should anticipate that we will continue to expand our international business and in particular in the emerging markets.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Now on the M&amp;A side, any product or geographic holes that you have that you are thinking you would like to fill at some point?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: I think we have gotten to the point with Moody's Analytics that there are some nice to haves, but we moved past the need to have stage. And we did have some things that we needed to acquire over the last few years, or build, in order to feel that we had a sufficiently complete offering to have an attractive competitive product.</p><p>We have gotten there, we feel good about that. It doesn't mean there aren't some things we've got our eyes on, I won't mention those by name. But we do -- we are always looking and we try to be disciplined about what we are looking at. But I would hope that there is going to be some things we can do over the next year or two.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Okay. That is probably a good lead into a question on professional solutions. We haven't really touched on that much. But Copal and Amba, and maybe you can talk about how those business -- just quickly talk about what they do, but also how they fit into your overall strategy?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Sure. Copal Amba are two businesses which we have acquired and combined over the last couple of years, Copal in 2011 and Amba in 2013. And we've also announced our plans to acquire the last one-third stake in Copal that we did not already own and we expect to complete that in December. So we will have 100% ownership of the combined entities Copal Amba next month, we believe.</p><p>Combined they provide research services and related professional services for mostly financial institutions around the world. So they are based in India, but their customer base is really global and has some of the largest financial institutions in the world.</p><p>And it is interesting because at first blush you might say, well, okay, that might be a nice business, and it is, it has been growing well for us, it is got good margins, we like that business quite a bit. But exactly how is the fit with the rest of Moody's?</p><p>And I would step back and say again we have to look at what is happening with financial institutions globally and with financial institution regulation. Just as pressure on financial institutions is encouraging disintermediation on the rating side of the business and is encouraging demand for risk management products in the ERS business, it's also been putting pressure on bank profitability.</p><p>And so, banks are looking to have a high quality research product and service that they continue to make available to their customers at the same time they are trying to manage a cost base. And so, as they work to square that circle the service that Copal Amba provides is a very high quality but lower-cost service for the research side of these institutions businesses.</p><p>So again, it is -- really all parts of our business and in some way are being pushed by what is happening in financial services, financial institutions regulation.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Okay. So I think I probably have time to sneak one last question in.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Okay.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: So I wanted to ask about visibility in the business. Basically if you look at transaction versus recurring revenue for you, it works out to be about half and half at this point.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Yes.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: And, but if you look at the percentage that is coming from the MIS business it tends to be more heavily weighted, roughly about two-thirds of that business being transaction-based. So how do you think about -- you're going to be giving guidance for 2005 in a couple of months. As you look out how do you then think about the visibility that you have on the business to give you the comfort on projections?</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Well, the recurring revenue base has been growing, it will continue to do so. Not only, and again, it is not only the recurring revenues that come out of the subscription business and our research data sales over on the Moody's Analytics side, although that is a large part of it.</p><p>But also the monitoring fees, the annual fees that we get on the rating agency side of the business as the stock of rated names grows, that creates an embedded recurring revenue base. So the larger that group of rated names becomes the more ballast we are going to have from a recurring revenue standpoint.</p><p>Now that being said, I still like transaction revenue associated with bond issuance. And I wouldn't look to fundamentally alter how we approach transaction versus recurring revenue for issuance purposes, because I believe that over time we are going to continue to see issuance volumes grow at a minimum in line with GDP.</p><p>I would say take out leveraging and deleveraging cycles you would have growth in line with GDP plus growth that comes from disintermediation on top of that. So the transaction pricing that we can get, as long as we believe that the volumes will be there, is an attractive source of revenue. There is no -- it is not discounted for a frequent issuer pricing program or something of that.</p><p>So I do like that component and I like maintaining that component even as we grow the recurring revenue base alongside of it.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Okay. Ray, (multiple speakers).</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Thank you very much.</p><p>BILL WARMINGTON: Thank you very much for coming, enjoyed it.</p><p>RAY MCDANIEL: Thank you.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

In this disruptive scenario, banks would remain subject to all regulatory requirements, while \"white labeling\" their products, and big tech partners will hold the key customer relationships and avoid regulatory barriers.</p><p>The report \"Fintech -- Global: Bank of the Future: Innovative incumbents will thrive; laggards will be disrupted,\" is available to Moody's subscribers at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_1116770\">http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBC_1116770</url>.</p><p>A podcast featuring highlights of this report can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.moodys.com/bankfuturepodcast\">www.moodys.com/bankfuturepodcast</url>.

The conclusions are part of this year's Moody's annual banking conference. The event has so far been held in Zurich (2 October) and Singapore (3 October), and further sessions are scheduled for Hong Kong (10 October), Tokyo (16 October) and Beijing (24 October) in Asia Pacific, and Milan (5 October), Paris (9 October), London (11 October), and Frankfurt (18 October) in Europe. </p><p> Another key focus of the conference is the impact of the macro-environment -- which now includes rising interest rates and increasing trade tensions -- on the banking sector.  With technological innovation, which is the basis of the conference's Bank of the Future presentation and discussion, Moody's analysts will discuss the impact of digital transformation on banks in four main areas: customer expectations; competition and business models; cost structure and infrastructure; and regulation.  \"In this environment, rapidly changing customer expectations will also drive digital innovations, while competition will stiffen and change focus along with shifts in technology and consumer demand,\" says Eugene Tarzimanov, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.  \"Furthermore, infrastructure will act as the foundation for financial innovation, but regulatory requirements will protect the position of incumbents,\" says Tarzimanov.  The specific topics for presentation and discussion for each of the four conference are:  \u2022 How the changing interest rate environment challenges the financial sector  \u2022 Bank of the future  \u2022 Big tech's shift to banking  \"On the changes in the interest rate environment globally, Moody's notes that the macro-environment is becoming more challenging with trade tensions a clear risk,\" says Tarzimanov.  \"Rising interest rates pose challenges for corporates and banks in emerging markets, but banks are generally well positioned to withstand emerging headwinds due to stronger capital and liquidity buffers,\" says Tarzimanov.  In each location, in addition to these global themes, senior Moody's analysts joined by leading industry participants will discuss issues specific to their own locations.  In the case of Hong Kong and Beijing, the conference will examine the outlook for Chinese Banks, and in Singapore the outlook for ASEAN and Indian banks. Meanwhile, the Tokyo conference will also look at the outlook for Japanese banks.  This publication does not announce a credit rating action.

However, some of that risk emerged first from more stringent European anticompetitive scrutiny, increased regulation and over $9bn in fines since 2016. However, Google was left largely untouched in the US. The company's most serious antitrust threat in the US was dropped by the FTC in 2013 and left the company unscathed. </p><p>The broad and bipartisan shift in tone from US regulators, lawmakers and presidential candidates poses a larger risk for the company. The company is exposed to large international fines. However, there are no US federal government fines for civil monopolization violations, and our most important fundamental concern is whether regulation or actions imposed on the company materially and permanently alter its business model such that its leading positions, business diversity and profitability are significantly constrained and reduced.  We believe that any potential probes or formal investigations will include long and labored processes and even if the most aggressive negative outcomes are assumed, they would likely be subject to legal actions and appeals which would result in long implementation delays. We believe that Alphabet is well conditioned for such battles and has so far effectively warded off actions that would kindle our major concerns. Google's profitable products are largely free to consumers, though their online activities are tracked, and compiled data about these online activities are used by advertisers to target consumers with greater relevancy. As there are only media reports so far, we presently believe that negative actions and rulings that would materially impact Alphabet's credit standing, remain a low probability. However, we note that in the event that an adverse outcome requires Google to modify its business model to limit or shrink its market position in its flagship search or advertising businesses, there would be significant implications for the company's credit standing given that about 85% of the company's revenues are generated from advertising and 83% of its advertising revenue is generated from its own websites.  Notwithstanding the risk posed by the heightened antitrust scrutiny, Alphabet maintains an extremely strong balance sheet with over $113 billion in cash and short-term investments against $19.9 billion in Moody's adjusted debt at March 31 (includes $7.6 billion transition tax payable and $8.2 billion in operating leases). Moreover, we expect the company to generate over $30 billion of free cash flow in 2019, some of which can be earmarked for any potential international fines without compromising the company's ability to invest in growth and innovation or materially altering its pristine liquidity.  Media reports are stating that the DOJ's investigation remains in its early stage and no formal investigation has commenced. However, the political environment is dynamic and as previously mentioned, these types of investigations and subsequent judicial appeals are often lengthy, reducing the likelihood of any near-term impact to Alphabet's credit profile.  Alphabet is the holding company for Google, which includes its advertising business and its \"Other Revenue\" (Google Play, Google Cloud, Hardware, YouTube subscriptions) and \"Other Bets\" subsidiaries. Google is the world's leading Internet search engine, and it maintains an index of websites and other online content for users, advertisers, Google network members, and other content providers.

Good morning everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, happy Monday.  It is Monday, September 10th.  Your top stories  right now just before 6:00a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moonves is out, the CBS CEO is stepping down as more sexual misconduct  charges surfaced.  The turmoil throwing a possible wrench into the CBS- Viacom merger, we've got all the details there.  Shari Redstone is winning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Futures this morning showing the markets will open higher, take a look.   The Dow Industrials set to be up better than 70 points this morning.   NASDAQ also strong this morning, up about 36, that's one half of one  percent.  </p><p>This after the major market indices closed lower on Friday, pretty much  across the board.  Dow Industrials gave up a third of a percent for the 79- point selloff.  NASDAQ was down a quarter of a percent as well as the  S&amp;P500.  </p><p>In Europe this morning take a look at the action and we do see money move  in to stocks, fractional moves across the board but nonetheless in positive  territory.  </p><p>Asian markets overnight mixed, as you can see worst performer was in Hong  Kong, Hang Seng Index down one and a third percent, China, Shanghai  Composite down one and a quarter percent.  </p><p>Peril in Paris to report, seven people have been injured this morning in a  knife attack in the City of Lights.  We've got the very latest this  morning.</p><p>Sour Apple, the House fit jobs built says that China tariffs will affect  its pricing.  What the president says the easy fix could be.  Apple shares  are down a fraction this morning.</p><p>And bang for your buck, a new report has a list of the most valuable  college degrees, the top spot may surprise you.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it  all down, our own Susan Li joining the panel this morning.  The CEO and  Managing Partner of Rosecliff Mike Murphy is here.  And Pollster and the  President of Maslansky &amp; Partners Lee Carter.  Good morning.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Good morning.  It's great to  be here.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF:  Happy Monday.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to you.  We've got the Bob Lighthizer, the trade minister  in Europe this morning talking about tariffs, perhaps probably doing a  deal.  Are the markets still concerned Susan about these tariffs and the  (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>LI:  Absolutely.  I mean, $200 billion could go to --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On China.</p><p>LI:  -- $207 billion for -- on China.  We don't have a new NAFTA yet and I  think you're seeing an overhang in the Asian market, I was telling you the  story right now especially with Apple and do they ship production out of  China under pressure for the U.S. president, I think trade is pretty much  the impact that we're seeing globally at this point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I feel like the markets in the U.S. have giving this  president a break and watching to see his negotiating.  I mean otherwise I  think the market will be a lot -- a lot lower, don't you think?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think professional traders Maria are looking past the headlines  and they're looking at the underlying fundamentals and what is clearly an  improving economy.  So, a lot of talk to about the Fed and the Fed raising  rates.</p><p>But I think the underlying fact that the economy is good, getting better is  what's keeping the market up at these -- at these levels.  So any trade  deal moves us to new high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We had a good jobs number on Friday, of course, and we've got  more data this week.  Meanwhile, the campaign trail is heating up.   President Obama on the campaign trail Lee, how's that going?</p><p>CARTER:  You know, it's been really interesting to watch because there's  been a lot of criticism obviously of him coming out on the right.  On the  other hand, this is the first time that we've seen something the left come  out and not be totally hysterical.</p><p>He's trying to get people activated and hopeful again.  He's reengaging in  some of that rhetoric and you're seeing a lot of people feeling good about  it.  But what really I think I'm seeing in this is that there's a huge  vacuum in leadership on the Democratic Party that he has to come back out  and he's feeling a void that really has been felt.  So, I think that the  democrats need them and that's not good for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  True.  The republicans are pushing back on some of his  ideas in terms of how this economy is doing and where it started and all of  that.  We'll talk about that.</p><p>Coming up this morning joining the conversation, White House Deputy Press  Secretary Hogan Gidley is here.  Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel,  former Congressman Allen West joins us, along with former Hillary for  America Senior Advisor, Democratic Strategist Adrienne Elrod back with us  this morning.  And Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew  Napolitano.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it, we got a big three hours coming up.  But our top  story right now, a major media shakeup to report, CBS had Les Moonves is  stepping down amid sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p>The size of Moonves' exit package will depend on whether he is found guilty  of any wrong doing stemming from CBS's internal investigations into the  matter.  Susan Li, does this affect the CBS going forward in terms of more  deals with them?</p><p>LI:  Well more deals that's been put off because they have new six board  members and part of this exit plan means that Viacom-CBS re-merger, that  won't happen for two more years.  </p><p>But then there's not going to be a sale of CBS as well and I think that's  going to pressure the shares because I think in the market had anticipated  there might have been some sort of shares -- sales to somebody but at this  point it looks like that's been put off with this Les Moonves departure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Sumner Redstone's daughter, Shari Redstone and Les  Moonves have been going at it in terms of where this company goes next.   Impact on the stock Mike?</p><p>MURPHY:  Not too much.  I mean, you saw a nice rally in the stock on Friday  as people thought that this wouldn't. </p><p>So the market Wall Street hates uncertainty.  So you get some sort of end  to this, you saw the stock rally about three percent on Friday.  So I don't  think this will have too much an impact -- of an impact here, it's more the  going forward story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He's got to put $20 million into a fund that will -- that will  go toward the MeToo Movement.  So, you know, that will come out of the  money that would have gone to him.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  You know, so CBS is trying to make this look as good as it  can.  But in a world we live in today, you know, a lot of its allegations,  I don't know true or false, some allegations are -- cannot be a negative  overhang on stock performance.  So getting him out of the way and moving  forward is the best thing for shareholders of CBS.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meantime, broader markets certainly will get impact if we see a  government shutdown at the end of the month.  Let's talk about that for a  moment because the president has been walking back this threat the last  couple of days.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal this morning is reporting that Congressional  leaders are expected to secure a deal today on three separate spending  bills avoiding a partial government shutdown by the end of the month.  </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham joined me yesterday on Sunday Morning Futures he  said a shutdown was not the right move at this time.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  I don't think it would be smart  to shut the government down between now and the end of September.  Under  President Trump, we're going to fund about 70 to 80 percent of the  government before September 30th, the first time we've done that in 30  years.  We'll get wall money, we got to do something with DACA, I think you  marry those two up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, it does appear that the president is walking back now.   There was an interview with Pete Hegseth over in Montana the other day when  the president was campaigning Lee.  </p><p>The president said, \"Look, I need that money for the wall but probably not  a good idea to shut the government down just a couple of weeks before the  midterm elections.\"</p><p>CARTER:  That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts?</p><p>CARTER:  Look, I think that this president could make it through if the  government did shutdown.  This is a president who negotiates hard, people  are getting used to it which is kind of crazy people are getting used to  these big threats, big moves, risky things that he's doing.</p><p>The problem isn't necessarily the success of the president, the problem is  on these races locally and the biggest threat right now people see is deals  not getting done.  People looking it's their biggest concern and saying,  \"If I elect this person I'm afraid of gridlock.\"</p><p>And so what really needs to happen right now is deals need to be made,  people need to come together and that kind of confidence will get people --  you know, will make them feel better going into the midterms if they can  vote the way that they're going to vote.  But if things -- deals don't get  done, that's going to make -- that's going to make for change and they're  going to vote for change.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The midterm elections obviously one of the most consequential  elections that we've seen in a long time.  </p><p>CARTER:  There's no -- there's no doubt about it.  There's 23 seats that  could change the course of, you know, the next several years.  And it's  interesting to see how this is really -- it's a day-by-day play.</p><p>The polling is changing.  Right now it's breaking towards the democrats and  I think the republicans need to come together, get some deals done, get  some action done, they've got to make people feel better about immigration  because sadly enough people aren't feeling better about immigration.</p><p>Even though the economy is strong, that's the only thing that the  republicans are pulling well on, it's not on the rest of it.  So they've  got to get some things done this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're coming together on tax cuts Mike.  </p><p>MURPHY:  They are.  And tax cuts I think are one thing that they need to  get behind.  But I don't know if a government shutdown though is really --  is that a story anymore?  I mean, we've seen it so many times over the  years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The president is walking it back.</p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So I think it -- the focus --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.</p><p>MURPHY:  -- being on tax cuts because people feel regardless of what party  they align with people prefer to have more money in their pocket and I  think a lot of people out there actually feel that.</p><p>You're seeing it consumer confidence numbers.  If the people have more  money in their pocket, they feel better and I think they're going to want  to keep more of the status quo.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you're not expecting this blue wave that we've talked about  six months ago then?</p><p>MURPHY:  I'd like to think I'm smart enough to not think I'm smart enough  to predict that.  You know, it changes -- at least that it's changing day- by-day and race-by-race.  So I don't know, I think they'll be -- it would  be great if we had two parties that could work together to get things done  for the good of all people.</p><p>CARTER:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well we'll see what the next legislation on economic  policy is.  The House Republicans are planning to introduce legislation  this week which could make permanent the individual tax cuts from last  year's GOP reform bill.</p><p>I spoke to President Trump and House Ways Means Chair Kevin Brady over the  summer who both felt confidence in a second round of tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably in October, maybe a little sooner than that and  it will be more of a middle class.  We did a lot for the middle class but  this will be even more aimed at the middle class.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20U.S.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you are on track for September vote?</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  We are.   So we had a great meeting with the president yesterday, just getting on the  same page on what we see for 2.0 and the timetable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So those interviews were in the summer, in July Mike.  We've  already seen a real impact from the tax plan.  Do we see an even bigger  impact on the stock -- on markets if we see Tax Cut 2.0?</p><p>MURPHY:  I think the market has priced a lot of this thing.  I don't think  it -- this will -- if this passes it's going to have a major push to the  upside on markets.  But I think ultimately the GDP growth that we're seeing  is allowing the administration to feel confident in pushing forward on this  Tax Cut 2.0.</p><p>So I think it's good for all parties involved and as long as we have the  growth there to support it, I think people will be confident with them and  I think it will help the markets but it won't be a huge part.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's a backdrop in terms of earnings but the tax cut plan  helped earnings.  Susan, what are we talking about, 25 percent profit  growth for 2018 is definite.</p><p>LI:  Probably.  And, yes.  Back-to-back of earnings growth of almost double  digits, right?  And we talk about the unemployment numbers as well, I mean  Wall Street was talking about 201,000 jobs created.</p><p>We're looking at the best employment market in 50 years and we did some  analysis and right now President Trump in his first of 18, 19 months in  office he's doing better when it comes to wage increases and also when it  comes to GDP growth as well as the previous administration.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep watching that.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, Paris is on alert this morning, the French  capital reeling after several people are injured in a knife attack  yesterday, we've got the very latest coming up next.</p><p>And a plan of succession, who's set to succeed Jack Ma as the head of  Alibaba.  Big changes there, we'll check it out next, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A shooting inside a nightclub at Memphis.   Cheryl Casone with the details there.  This happened overnight Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  It did Maria, good morning.  Yes.  Memphis detective say as many  as four people were injured in the shooting.  It happened at the Purple  Haze Nightclub.  It happened about 3:30 a.m. this morning inside of the  club.</p><p>So far police haven't released many details about what really happened but  report say at least four ambulances were called to the scene, we will get  more details hopefully this morning on the condition of everyone.</p><p>And then there's been a horrific knife attack in Paris, seven people  including two British tourists were injured in the attack at the French  capital.  Police arrested a suspect who reportedly from Afghanistan.   Witnesses say the man was armed with a knife and a metal bar.  It is  currently not being treated though as a terrorist attack.</p><p>Well another global headline, Alibaba Founder Jack Ma is stepping down as  chairman next year and he has named CEO Daniel Zhang as his successor.   Maria founded Alibaba back in 1999.  Greeted to one of China's largest  technology companies.</p><p>Ma says that he is stepping aside for Alibaba's next generation of leaders.   He is going to remain on the company's board of directors until the year  2020.</p><p>And then President Trump sending well wishes to all celebrating the Jewish  New Year.  The president tweeted this, \"Melania and I wish all Jewish  people Shanak Tova and send our warmest greetings to those celebrating Rosh  Hoshanah and the start of a high holy day.\"</p><p>The two-day holiday wraps up tomorrow night as observers engage in prayer  rituals and, of course, Jewish conditions Maria.  And those are your  headlines, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Shanak Tova from us too.  Thank you so much Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, made in the USA, President Trump renewing his call  for Apple to make its products in America, we got the technology giant is  now responding.  We're going to bring that to you.</p><p>And then cashing in after college, check out which majors are the most and  least valuable.  You want to know this, we're breaking it down, back in a  minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump tweeting at Apple after the  iPhone maker said that trade tensions with China will affect prices on  Apple popular gadgets.</p><p>The president writing this, \"Apple prices may increase because of the  massive tariffs we may be imposing on China, but there is an easy solution  where there would be zero tax, and indeed a tax incentive.  Make your  products in the United States instead of China.  Start building new plants  now.  Exciting.  Make America Great Again.\"</p><p>Joining me now to talk more about that is Investmark Advisor Group  Principal, Michael Lee.  Michael, great to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.</p><p>MICHAEL LEE, PRINCIPAL, INVESTMARK ADVISOR GROUP:  Good morning.  How are  we doing?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can Apple even afford to move the manufacturing here?  Would  that be a lot more expensive?</p><p>LEE:  OK.  I think overtime Apple can do whatever it wants.  But I'd say  what's going on right now, this can't be any surprise to Apple.  Tim Cook  has had several one-on-one meetings with the president.</p><p>This is coming and it's a lot -- it's about a lot more than trade.  You  know, China really is the number one enemy of the United States.  They're  attacking us from an intellectual property standpoint on a daily basis.  </p><p>I mean, there's defense contractor (INAUDIBLE) a month or so ago and they  said, you know, the Chinese government was trying to hack their firewall  like at least a thousand times a day.  So they're also engaging in some  predatory practices all over the world.</p><p>You know, going to countries to Sri Lanka and Kenya and putting an  infrastructure projects with loans they could never pay back.  Raving  resources from all over --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it sounds like you are -- you agree with the pushback  against China given what their behavior.</p><p>LEE:  Yes, abs -- what else are you going to do?  Should the U.S. just sit  by and let the -- let the Chinese, the communist government try to take  over the world who has no interest.  You know, they don't have the U.S.'s  best interest at heart.</p><p>I mean, I think the Trump Administration has said to them is, \"Look, we can  -- we can make piece of this.  We could make this work if you open up your  markets instead of trying to take control of all our companies that come  in.</p><p>CARTER:  But do you think -- how patient are people going to be with this?   Because I've been amazed for the most part optimism has stays up,  everybody's talked about how this trade war is going to have devastated  impact on consumer confidence in the market and yet it's not.</p><p>I think a lot of people think the president's doing the right thing.  But  how long do you think they'll give them to get this done?</p><p>LEE:  Well fortunately our economy is booming, right?  We had a wage growth  number of 2.9 percent on Friday but that doesn't also include the amount of  hours work per week.</p><p>So when you add the increase an hour's worth plus the wage growth, you add  a little of 5.1,  5.2 percent plus the tax cut.  Now you're in the high five percent for  disposable after tax stake home income.</p><p>So as things are booming here, what these tariffs are you're essentially  raising taxes.  And in-- from 2012 to 2013 nobody thought it was Armageddon  when Obama raised taxes.  So this -- these tariffs will be less than a  third of what the Obama Administration did and if the economy is strong  enough we can just sold Iran but there's multiple facets going on here.</p><p>And I think this policy push to revitalized manufacturing in our country  has worked.  If you look at the unemployment rates for high school drop  outs have peaked at about 15.5 percent during the recession or down now  around five percent.  So the people that forgotten him if you will has  really benefited in this department.</p><p>LI:  In terms of taxes, you know, Apple's argument is if the tariffs do go  in place, it's essentially attack on the consumer, they'll be paying more  for the Apple watch, Apple AirPods and so much more in terms of the Apple  line up.  So does it hurt the consumer at the end?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is -- which is what the Fed watching.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so do you have --</p><p>MURPHY: But I think on that point though the -- as the consumer tax going  would -- that would hurt the consumer, the tariffs.  So the president is  kind of like a perfect segue for him or lay up for him to say, \"OK, just  move your manufacturing over here to the U.S.\" exactly -- like I think it  couldn't have played out better for the administration, how this is doing.</p><p>LI:  Kind of hard to do when you employ 1.3 million in China.  You have  contracts there and as soon as most of your products are ready.</p><p>MURPHY:  Right.  But if you --</p><p>LI:  A supply chain ship takes a while.</p><p>MURPHY:  If you've seen their new factory, you know, it's -- I don't know  how many people at home but there's a ton of people there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I the U -- in the U.S.?</p><p>MURPHY:  In the U.S., yes.  So, you know, they've already started to  manufacture certain things here in the U.S. already</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's an interesting point, 1.3 million people working in  China for Apple U.S.</p><p>LEE:  Yes.  If you're willing to pay $1,000 for an iPhone like why wouldn't  you be able to pay $1,100?  If you're going to pay $400 for an iWatch why  wouldn't you pay $4265 or $450?  </p><p>I think there's a lot of pricing power with Apple and I don't necessarily  think these tariffs are a good thing.  But the only way that you can affect  change in China is with money, right?  They do not have an open economy,  they manipulate their currency and they use everything they can do because  they are -- remember they are communist.</p><p>And what does a communist want?  Do they want power?  They want prosperity.   And without an open economy, they're going to be capped out of their  growth.  So what the administration is saying, open up your economy, open  up your country to more foreign investment, in the end it will ultimately  benefit you.</p><p>I think the only possibility for resume change in China is if they go into  a recession and there's a popular uprising.  So several billion people in  that country, a lot of which lives slightly above the poverty line, no  coincidence there.</p><p>So they can say, \"Look, how many people we've lifted out of poverty?\"  It's  -- there's a lot more going on here than the price of air plug -- you know,  ear pods.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  There are deals happening right now, the president  apparently negotiating trade deals right now with Canada, with Japan, and  with China.  So at some point, markets are going to want some answers.</p><p>How much time which is was your question do you think markets give this  president to actually put some more deals on the -- on the board?</p><p>LEE:  Yes.  I think as long as the -- you know, the train doesn't go off  the tracks.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the markets believe that he's dealing -- we'll get  ultimately a better deal?</p><p>LEE:  Yes.  And look at what happened with Mexico and then we're starting  with the E.U. right now, this all make sense.  The U.S. in terms of  international trade is 800-pound gorilla, we're starting to throw our  weight around.</p><p>Exports year-over-year of 8.1 percent, 8.2 percent, imports are up nine  percent.  So global trade is booming regardless of all this trade tariffs  and all this trade spats.  So, you know, we were just talking, we are much  closer to the beginning of the second leg of this expansion than we are in  the end.</p><p>So if there's some sort of geopolitical event, tariffs attacks and sort of  war that's unforeseen, you know, maybe that could take us off the rails but  the snowball effect of the U.S. economy growing is happening right now and  as long as that continues, all this trade spats can happen.</p><p>And I think for most of these countries, they may be short term victories  to the U.S. but the U.S.'s point is that open up your markets.  Become --  the U.S. (INAUDIBLE) fairest trader in the world and as a result, we've  become the most powerful economy.</p><p>So what we're trying to do is get other countries to open themselves up and  in the end it will ultimately benefit them while it might seem like a  short-term loss.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sounds like you still want to buy stocks with this backdrop.</p><p>LEE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you invest right now, tell us?</p><p>LEE:  Look, I still like the banks.  I think rates are going higher, I  think deregulation is in effect slowly but surely.  And so as the economy  is growing, as rates going higher, banks are going to write more loans at  higher rates.</p><p>We have -- we've seen that trade come and go and come and go a few times  but, you know, I think the yield curve is much more likely to steepen,  steepen dramatically which would be huge for all the major banks than it is  to invert.</p><p>MURPHY:  And it seems like a great time, Mike, for it looking whether it be  the banks or the big cap techs.  When you get negative headlines that drop  these -- the whole Sector III to five percent in a week, seems like a great  time to buy them.</p><p>And we're seeing that right now in big tech, you know, companies like  Facebook having a big pull off.  Do you allocate money there right now?</p><p>LEE:  Yes.  So my two favorite sectors are -- well three, is big banks, big  tech, and then consumer discretionary.  You know, the cyclical play.  And  then everyone that says that this market is turning, you would see  leadership and defensives and we've seen that in tiny little pockets.</p><p>But the reality is since the election, the leadership has been in consumer  discretionary in big tech, I'm a buyer on weakness in any of those sectors.   You know, these companies are doing as well they possibly could, have tons  of cash and, you know, the sky is the limit as far as they could go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we will leave it there.  Michael, it's good to see  you.</p><p>LEE:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us, Michael Lee there.  </p><p>LEE:  Great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, bring the FISA documents, President Trump could  declassify documents related to the Carter Page and Bruce Ohr situation as  soon as this week.  We've got the implications there.  Should the president  declassify and what's the impact?  Then a treasure trove, ancient gold coins on earth in Italy, could be worth  millions of dollars.  We'll tell you where the stash was hidden all the  while, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.

The unlikely location, hundreds of old Roman coins  were discovered.  We've got the loot.  First though, our top story this  half an hour: Connecting the FISA dots.  The Trump White House expecting to  declassify the documents relating government surveillance of former aide,  Carter Page, and more on what DOJ official Bruce Ohr knew regarding ties  with the infamous Steele dossier.  Senator Lindsey Graham gave me his take  yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Somebody needs to watch those who  watch us.  So, if I were the president, for the transparency's sake, for  oversight's sake, for reforming the Department of Justice and FBI to get a  better product in the future, I would release this just to show what  President Obama said about how good his FBI and Department of Justice  actually were is a complete falsehood.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now to discuss is the Weekly Standard Deputy  Editor, Kelly Jane Torrance.  Kelly, good to see you.  Thanks so much for  joining us.  These documents are expected to show how they hatched the plan  to come up with this Trump had anything to do with Russia meddling in the  elections.  These documents are from 2016 before the actual investigation  of Trump-Russia collusion was launched in July 16, what would be the  downside of the president declassifying the documents?  </p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY EDITOR, WEEKLY STANDARD:  No, I think it's a  great idea, Maria, for him to declassify the documents.  You've got  Republicans and Democrats have been arguing for months now about what  actually happened and what it means.  Well, release them and let the  American people decide for themselves.  You know, lately we've had so many  anonymously sourced stories, but I've never seen as many as I have now in  the Trump era.  </p><p>And you know, media outlets sort of think, well, we're going to do the  vetting for you, we're going to -- we're going to not tell you who we're  talking to, but we're going to tell you what they are saying.  Well, people  can't judge whether someone's credible or not if they don't know who the  person is.  And so, I think it's great that we're going to see some more  transparency.  I hope, and find out what's actually going on because  there's a lot of unanswered questions especially about Bruce Ohr.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, I mean, are we actually going to see  accountability?  I mean, my viewers know that I never believe that there  was collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians from the get go.  And  yet, there were informants from the other side trying to impact the Trump  campaign and then we know that they got a FISA warrant to listen in on  Carter Page.  Really, really, bad stuff in 2016, will there be  accountability?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  You're right, Maria.  I will say, Bruce Ohr has been demoted  twice now.  So, we're seeing a little bit but he's still at the DOJ.  You  know what, you're right.  And you know, a lot of people don't realize that  he and his wife, Nelly, who of course worked for Fusion GPS on that  infamous Steele dossier, they actually met with Christopher Steele in July  of 2016 before, you know, the investigation started.  They had breakfast,  the three of them together and talked, they talked specifically about  Donald Trump at that meeting.  </p><p>Now, he, of course, didn't mention on any of the federal disclosure forms  that his wife was doing this work.  You know, we only are finding out  because of leaks and, you know, people finally telling us afterwards.  And  I have to say, I mean, Bruce Ohr could be responsible for even more  wrongdoing.  You know, the Russia investigation wasn't even under his  purview.  He was the head of an interagency group that was designed to look  at organized crime and drug deals.  And I'm sure your viewers will remember  that it came out recently that Project Cassandra -- which was the big  project looking at the Hezbollah drug running in South America, and of  course, made it their way to the United States and some U.S. businesses  were implicated.  </p><p>Well, Obama's DOJ actually had a problem with the investigation and told  people to back off because they didn't want to upset Iran during the  nuclear negotiations.  Now, Bruce Ohr was the head of that, he had to have  been involved in this and we haven't heard anything about that yet.  So,  you know, I have to say why is he, you know, meeting with Christopher  Steele about Russia and Trump when she's supposed to be involved in getting  the bad guys who are bringing drugs into this country and giving the  proceeds to tariff.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So, now, we know that Nelly Ohr and Bruce Ohr were  actually profiting, they were making money on this Steele dossier because  Nelly Ohr was working for Fusion GPS.  So, it really strikes me to see all  of the politicizing of these government agencies under the Obama  administration, the DOJ, the FBI, the CIA before that the IRS, and then you  see President Obama out on the campaign trail making explosive comments  about the Trump administration, the GOP and who has allegedly stoking the  flames of division, watch this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It did not start with  Donald Trump.  He is a symptom, not the cause.  The politics of division  and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the  Republican Party.  In two months, we have a chance to restore some sanity  in our politics.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What are your thoughts on President Obama on the campaign  trail?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, we have a sense to restore sanity in our politics in the  midterms?  You know, I have to admit I'm skeptical, but, you know, I mean,  you bring up a great point, Maria.  There's still so many unanswered  questions about different politics having something to do with DOJ  investigations, IRS investigations.  And, you know, I have to say, you  know, President Obama had a few good points in his speech, you know, he  talked about how some of Trump's policies aren't conservative.  </p><p>He almost looked like he was going to be reaching out to Republicans who  might be a little worried about somethings and maybe even try to bring the  country together.  But of course, he's President Obama, so the speech ended  up being more about himself and his goal to get more Democrats elected.   It's very disappointing and isn't very statesmanlike, just telling people,  well, you got to vote this fall, you know.  </p><p>CARTER:  Yes, I think it's really interesting.  And to your point that it  did seem like he was really reaching out to some Republican who were  disgruntled, but I think also, really, reaching out to independents.  And  we're seeing, you know, a trend; and more and more people leaving the  parties and going independent not just because they don't like the  president but also because they're so tired of gridlock and things not  getting done at the, you know -- because of the tribalism that exists.  </p><p>And so, to a certain extent, if you watch, and I did test some of this with  voters; they looked at it and they didn't hear him being as negative as  some of the things get picked up.  They see him saying, you know what, we  can do better than this and that's what we are hearing and taking away.   For those people who are a little bit disillusion by the current state of  affairs, so do you think that this is going to be effective for the  Democrats or this is just going to continue to (INAUDIBLE) some people who  are disgruntled?  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Yes, you bring up a great point.  I think he could have been  very effective if he had stuck to that, if he had sort of reached out,  saying, you know, I know you guys are sick of this craziness in Washington.   And let's face it, there is some craziness in Washington and there's people  on both sides responsible.  I mean, look at the Kavanaugh hearings.  That  was not a confirmation hearing of substance; you had Democrats encouraging  loud protestors to come in and there was no discussion.  </p><p>So, yes, I think, I think there are a lot of ways that the Democrats,  particularly President Obama, could be effective in reaching out to people  who are sick of business as usual.  But then, he spent the rest of his  speech talking like business as usual, saying well, Republicans have been  this way for years and, you know, take some responsibility for some of the  division that you caused in the country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'll tell you, you want to see nothing get done vote Democrat  in the November election.  You know, more Dems in Congress nothing gets  done for the next two years.  </p><p>CARTER:  Maria, that is a really good point because there's some recent  polling that came out that said more than 50 percent of Americans, their  number one concern about Democrats winning the house is that there's going  to be gridlock and nothing will get done.  And so, that's a really  important point that people need to keep in mind.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going to stop his agenda, and they're going to move to  impeach him and that's why this weekend, Vice President Mike Pence  responded to President Obama, listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I was very disappointing  to see President Obama break with the tradition of former presidents and  become so political and roll out the same tired arguments that he and  liberals have made over the last eight years.  The truth is, the American  people in 2016 rejected the policy and direction of Barack Obama when they  elected President Donald Trump.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Murphy, your thoughts?  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  So, I think the vice president is right in a lot of what  he's saying but when you look at what the Democratic Party has in place of  President Obama, when you have a lot of people screaming and yelling and  getting up, seeing him get out there, he's great on the campaign trail, and  rolls up his sleeves, he has a story to tell -- I think he can really speak  to the entire party.  So, for the Republican Party, I think they really  have to take notice of this, this isn't Nancy Pelosi or someone else  getting up and screaming and saying things that make no sense, he's very  good at what he was trying to do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Kelly Jane, it's good to  see you that morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>TORRANCE:  Thank you, and say hi to Wayne Gretzky (INAUDIBLE).  By the way,  his wine is very good, and you need to get him to leave you bottles of that  Wayne Gretzky wine, it's delicious.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good stuff.  All right.  We will tell him.  Thank you so much,  Kelly.  Wayne Gretzky will be here shortly.  Coming up, preparing for the  storm.  Hurricane Florence is strengthening as it targets the southwest.   We've got the latest forecast.  And then this cashing in after college, new  ranking this morning of the most and least valuable college majors, a must- see, breaking it down, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Now, we are watching Hurricane Florence that is  taking aim at the East Coast this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the details,  Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes.  There are three major hurricanes in Atlantic, Maria.  But  for Florence, she's rapidly gaining strength turning across the Atlantic  Ocean.  Right now, she's a Cat 2 storm with maximum sustained winds of 105  miles per hour.  It could slam the northeast -- southeast, excuse me, as a  major hurricane later this week.  It could hit Cat 4 status.  South  Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia already declaring states of emergency.  </p><p>Snap's Chief Strategy Officer, Imran Khan, is leaving the company.  Snap  says, that Khan told the company he is pursuing other opportunities.  Snap  also says that his departure is not related to disagreement.  Shares of  Snap are down more than 30 percent so far this year.  </p><p>Well, one of the most least valuable degrees out there.  (INAUDIBLE) took a  look at 162 college majors and then they ranked them.  Actuarial Science,  was named the most valuable major, six-figure average salary, 2.3 percent  unemployment in that field.  Actuary use math and science to determine risk  for insurance, finance, and other industries.  Now that you saw zoology was  number two, here are the least valuable: Miscellaneous Fine Arts,  Composition and Speech, Clinical Psychology, Cosmetology and Performing  Arts.  Anyway, sky high 9.1 percent unemployment rate for that last one.  </p><p>An archaeologist in Italy found buried treasure -- hundreds of Roman coins,  dating back to the late imperial era were found in stone jar in the  basement of a theater in Como, north of Milan.  Officials did not place  value on the coins but we're going to find out today, Maria, these coins  could be worth millions of dollars.  Crews are preparing the theater for  demolition when they discovered all those coins.  So, millions found.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, in Como, interesting.  Cheryl, will you tweet out the list  of the most valuable majors and the least valuable, because that's  something our viewers want to know.  It's interesting that actuary as the  number one.  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, and math, science, engineer, anything that's got a math base  is really the way to go through these days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool stuff.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Coming up, it's a great  one.  I'm talking to hockey legend Wayne Gretzky next about taking the  sports to China and big latest investment, that's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back sports icon, Wayne Gretzky, heading to China  tomorrow for the first time to grow hockey's profile there.  The National  Hockey League hall of famer was recently named the global ambassador for  China's only professional hockey team.  I sat with the great one and Chris  Riccobono, the CEO and Founder of UNTUCKIt, to discuss Gretzky's new  business venture.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wanted to ask you about China and what you're planning on  doing, how did that come about?  Where does this go?  </p><p>GRETZKY:  Well, it started about three years ago, and you know, China is  hosting the 2022 Olympic Games, Winter Games, and one of the things they  want to do is help build their youth hockey program so they approached us  about being partners with them and coming on board as an ambassador.  So,  next Tuesday my two sons and I are flying over to China.  So, the first  time I've been to China we're going to conduct some hockey clinics, and the  NHL actually is playing over there.  </p><p>Boston and Calgary, so we will get to see an NHL game, and then the Chinese  -- was actually playing KHL game in Russian league, so we'll see that also.   The goal for the Chinese people is to be a respectable hockey club in 2022  Olympic games and build their youth hockey, so, they're looking build new  ways to facilities in China, throughout China.  And so, I'm excited to be  part of it and this is a fun adventure not only for myself but for my boys  also.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us why, Chris, this shirt, UNTUCKIt.  This whole idea, is  different than any else.  I mean, I can get any shirt and not tuck it in,  right?  </p><p>CHRIS RICCOBONO, CEO AND FOUNDER, UNTUCKIT:  All men like to look good but  they don't want to over think it, with UNTUCKIt, we created a shirt that  was casual, sophisticated at the same time.  And anyone could het -- got to  their closet, feel not good, look good overthink it, we created a shirt  that's casual, sophisticated at the same time, anyone can go to the closet,  feel good, look good, shirt at the right length.  So, it's been exciting  ride.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, and that was basically the egg campaign as well.  What  really exited you about this was idea?  Tell us why you invested in  UNTUCKIt.  </p><p>GRETZKY:  Well, first of all Chris is unreal in the commercials.  I mean,  the natural, and he does a really nice job.  </p><p>CARTER:  He does.</p><p>GRETZKY:  And you know, for me, my -- we spent a lot of time in St. Louis  and we went to one of the stores in St. Louis, my wife and I.  We obviously  loved the shirts, they're comfortable, they're fashionable and we liked it  so much that Chris and I got together and we decided to be more involved  with the company from both marketing point of view and the financial point  of view.  But at the end of the day, it comes down to people and he's  wonderful men and I've had a lot of fun being part of this company right  now and I think there's great even bigger days ahead for UNTUCKIt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are you looking to do more investing in private companies  at this stage of your career?  </p><p>GRETZKY:  Well, for me, the partnership is most important and the people  that I surround myself with.  I like to be a guy that has longevity, I've  had a restaurant for 30 years, I've had a winery for seven years now.  So,  I like partners that see a long-term partnership.  And so, I'm really  excited about UNTUCKIt because not only is it an American company but it's  American company now going into Canada.  We're opening first store in  Toronto on Monday, and it's really exciting times for the company, I'm  proud to be part of it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  This started as an idea, Chris, obviously, and how did you get  it going?  I mean, where did you get the funding, how did you do so, so  well and now your name that we know of and watching your ads?  </p><p>RICCOBONO:  Yes, we launched seven years ago and raising money was not easy  because when you go to people in town, you are making a shorter shirt, they  kind of laugh.  You know, as opposed to investing.  So, we didn't raise  money. We had to be profitable from day one, and it just resonated with  people.  We came up with this marketing plan, where you're marking, you  know, on digitally but also across airline magazines and radio and T.V.,  and men just reacted.  And now, we'll have 54 stores by the end of this  year and 100 by the end of next.  We're going overseas which is one of the  reasons Wayne is such a great partner, he's recognized across the globe,  he's associated with excellence, which is great for UNTUCKIt.  So, it's a  very exciting time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said earlier, you're also doing women's clothing?</p><p>RICCOBONO:  Yes, we have a women's line.  Women requested that we have a  women's line because there are a lot of -- 60 percent of women buy for  their men or their husband or the boyfriend.  And when they're in the  store, they want to be able to try on something.  We have a kids line now.   We got all kids wear their shirts untucked. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got your shirt untucked right now.</p><p>GRETZKY:  Yes, they're comfortable.  </p><p>RICCOBONO:  It's great.</p><p>GRETZKY:  My wife and I did obviously some work -- we need some photos, and  my wife looks a lot better in the shirts than I do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, will we see you in the marketing in UNTUCKIt?  </p><p>GRETZKY:  This is the man (INAUDIBLE) so, I guess some of it.  </p><p>RICCOBONO:  Billboards in Toronto going up next week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  It's great to have you both on the  show.  </p><p>GRETZKY:  No, thank you, thank you very much.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  My thanks to Wayne Gretzky and Chris Riccobono.

We're expecting a rally at the start of trading this morning, this Monday  morning.  Dow Industrials now at the high of the morning, up 100 points.   The S&amp;P 500 is up 11.  And the Nasdaq up two-thirds of 1 percent, 45 points  higher.</p><p>This after the major indices closed lower on Friday.  Take a look.  Dow  Industrials gave up 80 points Friday, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P and  the Nasdaq gave up a quarter of a percent apiece.</p><p>In Europe this morning, markets are rallying there as well.  Take a look --  FT 100 up a third of a percent, CAC 40 up one-half of a percent, the DAX  index up almost half.</p><p>Asian markets were mixed overnight with the worst performer in Hong Kong,  Hang Seng index down one and a third percent.</p><p>Bring it home -- Apple.  Apple and Ford are among U.S. companies with big  products on the horizon.  What President Trump says both companies should  be doing to steer clear of tariffs and tariff tension.</p><p>Burning more than engines -- SpaceX had a successful launch early this  morning but the celebration eclipsed by Elon Musk smoking marijuana during  a podcast on Friday.

Great to see everybody.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS:  Nice to be here.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Big week.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  Big week coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got an economic story that's pretty positive but some  uncertainty on the trade front.  </p><p>MURPHY:  Yes.  It's going to be interested to see how it all plays out.  So  far the market has not really been affected by it.  I think that will  continue.  But day-to-day, the story changes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because the President's trade negotiation, Bob Lighthizer is in  Europe this week -- Susan, right.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And he's trying to get our European colleagues to do a deal on  trade.</p><p>LI:  NAFTA as well.  They're still negotiating this week.  China as you  saw, the crimp on Asian markets last night, mostly Apple suppliers and  FoxConn which assembles most of those iPhones down to a two-year low.  So I  would say trade right now is the overhang on the Asian side.</p><p>Here in the U.S., I think the focus might be more on interest rates and we  saw what happened on Friday.  I think this week we're starting off on a new  front, thinking maybe the economy is good and the Fed isn't going to raise  more than we expect.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All just about what 55 days or a little more than 55 days away  from midterm elections -- Lee Carter.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, really interesting times as we're going into the  midterms because it is a day by day changing, shifting market out there.   And so when you look at Obama needing to come out right now, I think that  is an indicator Democrats are really concerned and they need leadership.</p><p>I think it could be effective.  And I think Republicans are right to be  concerned right now and they need to go out there and fight hard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're talking about all of that this morning.  Joining the  conversation this morning -- White House deputy press secretary, Hogan  Gidley is with us this morning; along with Hillary for America senior  advisor, Democratic strategist Adrienne Elrod is here; Fox News senior  judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano weighs in as well; and the host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney will be along also.  Don't miss a moment  of it.  We've got a big two hours coming up.</p><p>But we kick it off this hour right now with this top story -- keeping  America safe.  National security advisor John Bolton making his first major  policy speech later today.  He is expected to address international threats  and announce the closure of the Palestinian Liberation Organization's  office in Washington.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Florida congressman and author of the book,  \"Hold Texas, Hold the Nation: Victory or Death\", retired U.S. Army  Lieutenant Colonel Allen West.  Colonel West -- good to see you this  morning.  Thank so much you for joining us.  </p><p>LT. COL. ALLEN WEST, U.S. ARMY (RET):  Always a pleasure -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me kick it off with John Bolton and what we're going to  hear from him.  What do you want to hear from John Bolton at this point?   Tell us your thoughts and what we could expect.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, I think it's very important that we see the intersection  between what is going on with the economic pressure we're putting on China  and what China is doing as far as their hegemonic expansion and their  threats to our national security.</p><p>If you have read the \"one belt, one road\" strategy of China, if you know  about the China-Pakistan economic corridor, you will see that China is  really expanding itself and is using its military, and it's using the  economic power that it's built up to now see testing their first domestic  aircraft carrier, building ports in east Africa and they're building ports  in Pakistan.</p><p>We know about the man made islands that they have in the South China Sea.   That's where about 45 percent of the sea lane of commerce transits through.   And we're seeing increased pressure between China on Taiwan as well.  And  we know the connection with North Korea.</p><p>So I think regionally, as you go across the Middle East, what Russia is  doing and also in South America, you will see some of the incredible  threats that we're facing.  And we need to have a solid strategy to  confront them.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's interesting.  No matter who we ask, most people  agree that it was time for somebody to push back against China.  That their  behavior has gotten to a tipping point.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at home, we've got this \"New York Times\" anonymous op-ed  and the fallout continuing there, sources told me that the administration  is closing in on the author, potentially somebody in national security.   Vice President Mike Pence slammed the author yesterday.  Listen to this --  got to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  To have an individual who  took that oath, literally say that they work every day to frustrate the  President, advancing the agenda he was elected to advance is un-democratic.   It's not just deceitful but it's really an assault on our democracy.  And  that person should do the honorable thing, step forward, and resign.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But Colonel, he's probably not going to resign, he or  she.  I mean what's your reaction to that op-ed, the anonymous op-ed in  \"The Times\" and the continued fallout?  What's the damage here?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, the damage is that we now know that there is something called  a deep state, the fact that you have someone within the administration that  is saying that they're working counter to the policies of the President,  just because they don't like the President.</p><p>The op-ed started out by talking about all the successes of the Trump  administration, but then it's talking about how this person and others are  part of a resistance movement.  That's really a resistance against the  duly-elected president of the United States of America.  So I think that we  have a challenge to our constitutional republic and our system of  democracy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  All this while the economy is doing quite well, Mike  Murphy -- as you've been saying.  The President just tweeted out this  morning, and he says this.  \"The GDP rate of 4.2 percent is higher than the  unemployment rate of 3.9 percent for the first time in over 100 years.   These numbers keep getting better -- Mike.  </p><p>MURPHY:  The numbers are getting better and it seems like we're not at just  a single one-time blip to the upside.  This seems like it's sustainable.   It seems like there's real economic growth and that could actually be  getting better, not worse.</p><p>And it's not that long ago we were talking about a new world of 2 percent  GDP growth.  And here we are way above that and double and it seems like  things are kind of just getting started for the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile President Obama is out on the campaign trial now,  Colonel.  What's your take on what we're hearing from President Obama in  the face of all these very strong numbers on the economy for Trump's  economy?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, I find it very hypocritical and quite humorous that President  Obama in a town hall meeting once stood up and chastised and kind of  derided President Trump, saying that how is he going to do this thing about  bringing all of these jobs back.  I mean this is not easy.  What's his  plan?</p><p>And in 18 months he's done that.  And now we see President Obama trying to  take credit for it when he was chastising the President for his strategy to  do it.  So I think that as Lee was saying, the Democrats are in a lot of  trouble when you have to bring back out President Obama.  And I don't think  that this is going to work well for the Democrats when they have to reach  back in order to try to go forward.  </p><p>CARTER:  You know, Colonel, I'm really curious, you know, when I look at  what's happening right now on the left, there is so much anger.  There is  so much vitriol.  They don't get what's going on.  They're blinded to  economic growth.  They're saying that this isn't happening, people aren't  really secure.  That -- I mean they're sort of really blind to what's going  on.</p><p>And when I look at people that are doing that, it's really that they're  afraid.  When people are afraid they can't see the truth.  And what is it  that you think they're so afraid of?  And how do Republicans reassure them?   Because they're going to need some of these Democrats and people who are  afraid in order to win the midterms.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, first of all, Lee -- you have to understand that sometimes  facts and truth to the Democrats are like sunlight to the vampires.  It  throws them into an apoplectic state.  And they cannot understand, they  cannot agree with what is happening.  They cannot understand that, you  know, the economy is doing well and national security, we're rebuilding our  military, our oil and gas industry -- all of these great things.</p><p>So what they have to do is demonize an individual.  That's one of Saul  Alinsky tactics.  And they have to try to leverage that as a means because  they don't have any policy or strategies that will work well for the  American people.  So hating Donald Trump is now kind of becoming hating  America.  </p><p>LI:  Well, Colonel West -- I think voters vote to better their lives.  And  when they see that their wages are going up, they see that they are finding  employment, and the economy is doing well -- I'm not so sure that that's  going to, you know, create a blue wave in a few months' time in the  midterm.  </p><p>WEST:  Well, the thing is, if you're constantly getting barraged with a  certain message, sometimes you will believe that message.  And if you turn  over to other media outlets or look at what has happened with this  anonymous op-ed and the Bob Woodward book that came out -- this is about  putting pressure, this is about trying to dominate a narrative and not  talking about the economic success and where the American people are.</p><p>So I think that you will see an incredible turnout that will support the  President and his policies.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think -- do you worry that the House flips, though?  Do  you think that the Republicans will gain seats?  </p><p>WEST:  The most important thing I think the Republicans need to understand  is that there are some people that have not been supportive of the  President's policies because of the fact that they are afraid of supporting  the President's policies means that they support the President and his  personality.</p><p>The Republican Party has to be able to bifurcate this and talk about their  strategy, their policies going forward as opposed to the Democrats that are  saying they're going to repeal the tax cut law.  They're going to impeach  the President.  They're going to abolish ICE.</p><p>Or you have people like Ocasio-Cortez that are out there -- this is a  socialist policy agenda.  That's not what the American people want.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, we still -- you know, the Colonel has a great point, Lee.   We still don't see an actual policy -- </p><p>CARTER:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- coming out of the Democrats.  It's all abolish ICE, resist,  impeach Trump.  </p><p>CARTER:  Well, the thing that I think is really interesting -- and we saw  this going into the 2016 election is the people who are reacting aren't the  ones who are winning.  Hillary Clinton was very reactive through a lot of  the 2016 cycle.  And that's pretty much continued all the way through.</p><p>Democrats are reacting to Donald Trump.  They're reacting constantly and so  one crisis comes out, there's a border security crisis they're going to  abolish ICE.  Everything, it's counter-balancing to what the Republican  agenda is.</p><p>And yet, when you look at what people are looking for, they want stronger  borders.  And I think that Democrats have a huge miss there by saying their  reaction is abolish ICE -- that's not what people want.</p><p>When you look at the polling and you see how people are reacting to the  President's speeches.  They want stronger border security.</p><p>So you can disagree on policy but the way that they're going about it I  think is one that's really damaging.  And furthermore, I think it's really  important that when you look at this polling, you see how unpopular the  President is, leadership in the left is even more unpopular than our  president.</p><p>So we've Nancy Pelosi under 30 percent popularity -- so you've got an issue  where -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh.  She's even worse than -- ok.</p><p>CARTER:  She's even worse than the President.  And so you've got an issue  where you're thinking that because somebody is so unpopular, you're not  just going to vote against them, you're going to vote for another party.</p><p>And I think that's short-sighted.  I think people might stay home if  they're not happy with the current situation.  They're not necessarily  going to go out and say, you know what, \"I'm going to vote Democrat today  because I don't like this president.\"  That's not the way it works and  certainly not the way it works in the midterms.  </p><p>WEST:  If I could say one thing -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead -- Colonel.  </p><p>WEST:  Just imagine that if the Democrats were to take over the House, the  chairman of the Financial Services Committee would be Maxine Waters.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, that's a good point.  But there's also -- let's not  forget, that this investigation into the wrongdoing at the top of the FBI  and the DOJ -- that will completely go away.  We won't hear another word  about the fact that they got a FISA warrant to wiretap an American citizen  for no reason because all of the committee chairmen will change. </p><p>So we won't hear that.  So it's really a very consequential midterm  elections, no doubt about it.</p><p>Colonel -- thanks for weighing in this morning.  </p><p>WEST:  My pleasure.  Thank you very much -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you.  Colonel West, joining us there.</p><p>Coming up, Les Moonves is out -- details on the leadership shakeup over at  CBS, following harassment allegations against the CEO.  More women coming  forward, making these charges this week.</p><p>Then President Trump versus Ford Motor -- the latest war of words between  the commander-in-chief and that automaker.  Stock this morning is up just a  fraction.  We'll tell you what's behind the move. </p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Apple's expected to go big with its new iPhone.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Get ready for a super- sized screen -- Maria.  The \"Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that Apple  is going to unveil two new iPhones on Wednesday, a lower-priced one with a  6.1-inch LCD display; and a pricier one, 6.5-inch OLED display, the average  screen area, 23 percent larger than last year's.  Three new phones, 28  percent bigger than the two models unveiled in 2016.  Supposedly people  want more room for their apps on their phones.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Trump pressing Apple to move its production to the  U.S. from China.  Tweeted over the weekend, \"Apple prices may increase  because of the massive tariffs we may be imposing on China.  But there is  an easy solution where there would be zero tax and indeed a tax incentive.   Make your products in the United States instead of China.  Start building  new plants now.  Exciting, exclamation mark, #MAGA.\"</p><p>Well, the tweet came after Apple said that it plans -- it said that U.S.  tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would affect its product  line.  Following the President's tweet, shares of Apple suppliers actually  fell in Asia.  The stock here, though, is higher in the premarket, up  almost a half a percent right now.</p><p>And then Ford is responding to another tweet from President Trump that the  company can begin building it's small Focus Active here in the U.S. instead  of China.  President Trump tweeted yesterday about reports that Ford won't  sell the car in the U.S. because of those tariffs.  Well, he tweeted,  quote, \"This is just the beginning.  This car can now be built in the  U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs, exclamation mark.\"</p><p>Ford said it has no such plans to build that car in the U.S.  However,  there's this.  Ford does have plans to steer towards electric vehicles.   They teased this photo of its all-electric performance SUV.  And I don't  know what you think.  I think it looks kind of like a Mustang, I'm  guessing.  The car is code-named Mach 1.  They're investing $11 billion  into electric vehicle technology.</p><p>I mean look, Mustangs can be gas guzzlers -- Maria.  So this might be it.   Good move by them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It looks good.  Yes.  Thanks -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile the President just tweeting again this morning.  He  just said this.  \"If the Democrat had won the election in 2016,\" the  President writes, \"GDP which was around 1 percent and going down would have  been minus 4 percent instead of up 4.2 percent.  I opened up our beautiful  economic engine with regulation and tax cuts.  Our system was choking and  would have been made worse.  Still plenty to do.\"</p><p>And of course the administration now is talking about tax cuts 2.0 that  they're working on this week.  We'll see if that has further impact on  economic growth.</p><p>Coming up, Elon Musk is under fire still -- the new backlash for the Tesla  CEO after he was filmed smoking pot during an interview.  That's next.</p><p>And then kicking off controversy, the outrage after two Miami Dolphins  players take a knee during the national anthem -- that's later this hour.</p><p>Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Three, two, one, zero -- ignition.  Lift-off.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was a clip of the latest successful SpaceX launch on its  Falcon 9 rocket from early this morning.  The victory for the aerospace  company coming as Fox Business correspondent Charlie Gasparino is reporting  that the Air Force is now looking into CEO Elon Musk's behavior following  his decision to smoke marijuana during an interview last week.  This is  because SpaceX is a government contractor and marijuana use is not allowed  for those within government security clearance.</p><p>Joining us right now is Needham &amp; Co. managing director Rajvindra Gill.   Rajvindra -- good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>RAJVINDRA GILL, MANAGING DIRECTOR, NEEDHAM &amp; CO.:  Thank you. BARTIROMO:  Your take on all of this?  </p><p>GILL:  Well, I think this episode reflects a complete lack of judgment and  a certain level of recklessness, you know, to go on a podcast which is one  of the world's largest podcasts.  And I watched actually the podcast.  It's  almost three-hour episode.</p><p>It was a very interesting conversation.  But to go on, you know, and  exhibit these types of activities I think reflects a level of lack of  common sense.</p><p>Even during his interview, he was getting tweets from friends of him saying  what are you doing?  You know, doing these activities on-air.</p><p>But I think the bigger issue to me in terms of management credibility are  two things.  One: his reversal of taking the company private in just 17  days.  To me that was a very unacceptable situation where he essentially  reversed course very quickly.  But then also -- the level of executives  that have left over the past two years.</p><p>So we just put a note out this morning, in our note we've based on our  count -- 11 executives have left the company in the past year alone.   Nearly 23 executives have left the company in the past two years.  And  these are key levels of management -- the chief accounting officer, the  head of engineering, the head of the auto pilot who came from AMD.  </p><p>LI:  Human resources, sales -- </p><p>GILL:  Human resources.</p><p>LI:  -- engineers, you name it.  But isn't it about cash positioning.   Don't they have a convertible to pay next year in March?  Do they have the  cash to pay it?  I think that's probably the more concerning point for the  balance sheet.</p><p>GILL:  Yes.  We've talked about this at length.  They have a convert that's  due March of 2019.  </p><p>LI:  And they have to be above $359 a share.  </p><p>GILL:  Right.  The conversion price is $359.80 or so, and if the stock is  not above $359, they owe $920 million in cash.  They can't convert that  debt to equity.</p><p>And they're burning through about -- our estimate, about $2 billion of free  cash flow this year.  So, you know, there is a significant amount of  pressure for him to generate cash immediately, generate profitability  immediately.  So those are -- we have a huge issue in terms of their  capital structure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How are they going to do it?  Look at the stock and what  happened on Friday.  Share tumbled 10 percent on Friday with the outspoken  CEO makings waves following that podcast appearance.</p><p>A warning -- this video may be offensive to some viewers, but watch it.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE ROGAN, \"THE JOE ROGAN EXPERIENCE\":    I mean, it's legal, right?  </p><p>ELON MUSK, CEO, TESLA:  Totally legal.  </p><p>ROGAN:  Ok.  </p><p>How does that work?  Do people get upset at you if you do certain things?  </p><p>MUSK:  Tobacco and marijuana in there.  That's all it is.  </p><p>ROGAN:  The combination of tobacco and marijuana is wonderful.  </p><p>MUSK:  I mean the only think I've kept is Twitter because I kind of like to  have some means of getting the message out, you know.</p><p>ROGAN:  Right.</p><p>MUSK:  That's about it.  So far, so good.  </p><p>It's mostly -- I think it's on balance more good than bad but there's  definitely some bad.  So hopefully the good outweighs the bad.  A vast  number of negative comments, for the vast majority I just ignore them, the  vast majority.</p><p>ROGAN:  Yes.</p><p>MUSK:  Every now and again you get drawn in.  It's not good.  </p><p>ROGAN:  It's not good.  </p><p>MUSK:  You make mistakes.  </p><p>ROGAN:  Yes, you can make mistakes.  </p><p>MUSK:  You can make some mistakes.  I'm not sure why people think that  anyone would think that deleting a tweet makes it go away.  It's like  hello, been on the Internet for a while.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile this is all -- Tesla is reportedly starting immediate  deliveries of its Model 3 cars.  The company aims to increase its sales  figures.  So Rajvindra -- I mean you've previously downgraded the stock.   What do you do as an investor?  And as Susan mentioned $359 is the price  for the convert.  It's at $263.  How are they going to get to $359 by this  deadline?  </p><p>GILL:  Well, they're going to try to, you know, reflect that they're going  to be profitable in Q3 and hopefully the stock pops.  And so as a result,  they're sell a lot of more expensive vehicles. So they're selling a lot of  $65,000 -- $70,000 Model 3, all-wheel drive cars. </p><p>But our problem is that they have a reservation list of 420,000 over the  last two years that they've built up.  What percentage of those  reservations are folks that were expecting to get a $35,000 car, minus a  $7,500 tax credit.  They're not even producing the more cheaper version of  the vehicle.</p><p>Or if you go to the Web site, all you can get is the all-wheel drive, you  know, starting at $49,000.  And it goes all the way up to $80,000.  So  they're not even having those cheaper version cars available.</p><p>So the wait list has now been two years.  We think a large percentage of  people are expecting $35,000.  We think that the cancellations have been  increasing.  We've been hearing reports that refunds are accelerating and  that folks are not configuring either.</p><p>They're not -- once they put the deposit down they have to configure and  pay an extra $2,500.  They're not configuring at the rate.</p><p>So I think what's going to happen is that there could be some short-term  volatility.  They show that they're profitable in 3Q as they sell more  expensive vehicles and there are higher margins.  And then as we go into  2019, that's when the real issue comes to play in terms of what is the real  demand for that Model 3 and can they make profit on the $35,000 to $40,000  car.  </p><p>LI:  But here's the main question on the markets is should Elon Musk stay  at the top of Tesla.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I was just going to say that.</p><p>LI:  Yes.  Unpredictable.  </p><p>GILL:  If it was a private company he would be hailed as a hero.  But the  fact that it's a public company I think there are a lot more pressing  issues that he has to address and it is publicly -- he tapped the public  markets for a lot of money.  So I think that's a big deal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the pressure on him to step down now has got to be high.  </p><p>GILL:  Well, I think, you know, the company went public in 2010.  They've  only been profitable maybe one or two quarters in that eight-year period.   Every year they've had to go to the capital markets either on the equity  markets or the debt markets to raise money, every single year.  </p><p>LI:  You couple those concerning behavior so what do you thinks Raj -- I  mean you have to make a call, does he stay?  </p><p>GILL:  Well, I don't have a view.  I mean that's going to be the decision  from the board of directors.  I think for me, the biggest issue was the  reversal of the public-private.  To me, that should not be discounted.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But putting out a tweet, funding secure, we're going private -- </p><p>GILL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- and then coming out with two blogs saying no, no, no we're  staying public.  </p><p>GILL:  Right.  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What would it get to get you upgrade the stock and buy the  stock?  Would it be Elon Musk stepping down and a new CEO coming in?</p><p>GILL:  It would depend on who the CEO is.  If the CEO is coming from -- he  or she from, you know, an automotive background, I think that would be  beneficial.  They clearly have very good technology in terms of autonomous  driving, even on their EV technology -- the battery technology.</p><p>They have problems of scaling profitably and so that's the issue.  But I do  think that the competition is accelerating.  It's heating up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  For sure.</p><p>GILL:  You look at Jaguar.  You look at Mercedes, Audi, Volvo, they're all  coming out with SUV electronic vehicles end of this year, going to 2019.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>Aaa The Model S and the Model X have been vehicles that have existed for  many, many years.  They haven't been updated in a while.  There will be a  ton of competition coming in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Great to see you.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>GILL:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Rajvindra Gill joining us there on Tesla.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump just tweeted again this morning, here's what he  just said.  The Woodward book is a joke.  Just another assault against me  in a barrage of assaults using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources.   Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them like the book are  fiction.  Dems can't stand losing.  I'll write the real book, the president  says.  </p><p>Wow, we'll see what the president book looks like when he decides to write  that.  By the way, that Woodward book is going on sale this week.  </p><p>Coming up, a leadership shakeup at CBS, the very latest developments as CEO  Les Moonves exits the media giant, that's coming up.  </p><p>And then, Amazon Go is growing, the Silicon Valley company's plans for  expanding the cashier less stores, back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning.  Thanks so much for joining  us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, September 10th.  Your top  stories right now, 7:34 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>Breaking news this morning, President Trump just tweeted this, the White  House is running beautifully, we are making some of the greatest and most  important deals in our country's history, with many more to come.  Big  progress.  According to the president this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, trade wins, investors are looking to buy this morning as U.S.  companies prepare for more trade negotiations with China.  Futures  indicating a rally at the start of trading this morning.  And we are  looking right near the highs of the morning right now, Dow Industrials up  90 points, the third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 is also up a third of a  percent.  And the NASDAQ is up one half a percent with a 40 point move  right now.  </p><p>We're expecting strength at the opening of trading after market indices  closed lower on Friday.  As you can see Friday's performance.  Dow  Industrials gave up 80 points, a third of a percent.  The S&amp;P 500 and the  NASDAQ down a quarter of a percent.  </p><p>In Europe this morning, stocks are rallying.  Take a look at the money  moving into equities, FT-100 up a third of a percent, CAC Quarante and the  DAX Index up one half of one percent.  </p><p>Asian markets were mixed overnight, biggest loser was in Hong Kong, Hang  Seng Index down 1-1/3 percent.  </p><p>Wildfires in California wreaking havoc this morning.  We have the very  latest on the fire's path of destruction continuing.</p><p>Getting bigger.  Amazon is planning yet another Go store, the retailer's  investment in brick and mortar, coming up.  </p><p>And wild comeback, Aaron Rodgers return leads the Packers to victory as  Colin Kaepernick praises more anthem protests on the football field.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this Monday morning.  But first our top story  this half an hour, Les Moonves is out at CBS.  The imbalance chief  executive steps down after deluge of sexual misconduct allegations, these  follows another weekend write-up from journalist Ronan Farrow.  Moonves'  statement reads in part, untrue allegations from decades ago are now being  made against me that are not consistent with who I am.  Effective  immediately, I will no longer be chairman and chief executive officer of  CBS.  </p><p>Joining us now to discuss, Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew  Napolitano.  Judge, good to see you this morning.  </p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to the all this?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you know, CBS would have a very serious image problem on  -- problem on its hands if it didn't react this way.  It happened rather  quickly.  I mean, it seems to me it was just about two weeks ago that they  engaged a very prominent law firm.  I actually know the lawyers involved,  to do a preliminary investigation and whatever they came up with must have  shown the board that the allegations are credible, notwithstanding Les  Moonves and his wife's denials.  </p><p>And then of course, as they began to negotiate his departure, Ronan Farrow  came up with another half dozen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  One of which --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Six more women.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  One of which quite serious, one of which goes beyond verbal  and actually goes to an alleged physical assault.  It's interesting, our  colleague, Charlie Gasparino, seems to be in the middle of all this  somehow.  He's reporting that he's leaving without a nickel today and  they're going to negotiate but the negotiation will rise or fall based upon  an investigation that has not yet taken place because it is an  investigation of the new allegations that Ronan Farrow revealed over the  weekend.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We'll see what comes out of this.  But he was forced to  leave immediately.  I mean, these six women, the additional women, what are  they -- what are they saying now?  And why now are they coming out?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I don't know why now they're coming out.  But one of them  alleges an assault.  I don't know the details of it, but it's more than  verbal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Does this change the CBS-Viacom merger in any way?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes it does -- yes it does.  It actually puts it on hold for  two years.  It was scheduled to go to trial.  Well, not it was scheduled to  go to trial, but issues around it, whether or not CBS could dilute the  Redstone stock is the subject of litigation scheduled here in Manhattan for  October 1st.  The two parties, the Redstone team and the CBS team, minus  Moonves -- Moonves is the beast in the night or had been to the Redstone  team and the CBS team minus Moonves.  Now, Moonves of course, is the beast  in the night or had been to the Redstone team.  </p><p>So with him out, I don't think there's going to be a trial.  I think  there's going to be an amicable resolution to this somehow.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  They have.  Yes, basically,  that's part of this negotiation is that, there's a date on.  So, there's no  more CBS and National Amusement's re-merger.  The Shari Redstone wanted to  engage in and no dividend dilution.  So she doesn't --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>LI:  Use her voting power as well.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, she wins?  </p><p>LI:  So, I would say Shari would (INAUDIBLE) win, yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, you could argue that she wins, yes.  She stays where she  is.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Of course.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And she controls 79 percent of the stock.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right and he is out.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, MANAGING PARTNER &amp; CEO, ROSECLIFF:  With Moonves out that --  you think still delays this merger or potential merger?  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, they told the court over the weekend to the extent you  can communicate with a judge over the weekend.  They told the court the  weekend or announced that they're going to tell the court this morning,  they want a two year cooling off period and then they'll be back there.   They are not going to go back there.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  They will resolve this in my opinion in two weeks.  Well,  they'll resolve it as soon as the Moonves issue is resolved.  Because the  Redstone folks will have a substantial say in who his successor is. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right and CBS --</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  It's obviously not going to be somebody that hates them the  way Les Moonves did.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right and CBS said it did settle the legal dispute with the  controlling shareholder.</p><p>Let me switch gears judge.  Because we haven't seen you since that hearing  or circus of a hearing took place last week with the Kavanaugh hearings.   I'm told that the vote will take place on September 20th this month and  there's a lot of optimism that Brett Kavanaugh does become Supreme Court  Justice Kavanaugh.  Your reaction to the --  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Well, the Democrats in my view and Lee can speak to this  better than I, but the Democrats in my view had two goals.  One was to pick  off three Republicans, Rand Paul and the allegations that Judge Kavanaugh  was involved in warrantless spying and torture recommendations, not  personally involved but recommendations to President Bush and Susan Collins  and Lisa Murkowski on the allegation that he secretly wants or believes he  can interfere with Roe versus Wade.  </p><p>They did not succeed with any of those, so that means they know that all  Republicans are still in line.  If all Republicans are still in line, that  means that Chuck Schumer will release the vulnerable Democrats to vote yes.   It won't put Judge Kavanaugh over the top.  He'll be put over the top by  the Republicans but it will remove the Kavanaugh vote as an issue in the  re-election campaign of these vulnerable Democrats.  </p><p>I don't know they're personally vulnerable.  They're incumbent Democrats  running for re-election in the senate in states that the president carried  handily in 2016.  That was the first goal that failed.  </p><p>The second goal, and we'll talk about this during the break, was to animate  the base by being about as aggressive against him on issues dear to the  base as they can.  This is what led, my friend of 25 years in fellow in New  Jerseyan, Senator Cory Booker.  One of my senators of my home state to  engage in the bizarre histrionics that we saw.  Now I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  He embarrassed himself.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Now, I read all the Jersey papers over the weekend and they're  giving him the benefit of the doubt.  He is very, very popular in New  Jersey.  I don't think it plays that way throughout the rest of the nation.</p><p>The benefit of the doubt is, he really thought that these documents that  had been stamped confidential were confidential and that he was risking his  career to break the rules of the senate and reveal them because he thought  it showed another sign of Brett Kavanaugh that the Republicans had kept  hidden.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, they were -- they were already released.  I think he  ruined his political -- I think he ruined his run for president.  What do  you think Lee?  </p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  I think that people do not  follow hysterical leaders.  And the fact that he has gotten so angry and so  hysterical is not reassuring to folks.  It's not going to make them want to  follow him.  It's going to either make him say, yes, I get that he might be  on the same page as I am, and I'm frustrated with this whole thing too, but  I think this was not a good move for him because leaders stay calm through  adversity.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So this was --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Remember when he took out Kirstjen Nielsen, your silence is  definite.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  Yes.  And we were talking about these mythological stories  about Mayor Booker running at the burning homes and neighborhoods in Newark  and saving babies and other Muslims. (CROSSTALK) was a fire.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's hard to (INAUDIBLE) that stunt.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, if this was either a profound misunderstanding or a gross  miscalculation.  The editorials in New Jersey may like him.  But this did  not play well amongst even the Democrats throughout the rest of the  country.  </p><p>CARTER:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the broader issue judge is really what I want to get your  take on and you too Lee.  I mean, the broader issue of not being able to  get anything done.  You Have a hearing for a Supreme Court justice here and  as soon as Grassley starts welcoming everybody, you've got Kamala Harris  and the others trying to just shut this thing down.  You're not getting  anything done.  Why would anyone feel like if I vote for a Democrat in  November things are going to get done?  Nothing will get done if the  Democrats take the House.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I share -- I share that -- I share that view 100 percent.  But  the Democrats must have felt -- they're not stupid people.  They must have  felt that their base wanted them to behave this way.  That they take all --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, their base also wants socialist.</p><p>CARTER:  No Doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There's that.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  So, I mean, he's going to be confirmed whether you like him or  not.  I have a lot of problems with him from my libertarian perspective.   But he's a brilliant, decent, experienced person.  He's the type of person  the president he -- president said he would nominate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO:  And they couldn't find any flaws and they have the votes, OK.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Judge, thank you.  Judge Andrew Napolitano.  We'll be right  back.  </p><p>NAPOLITANO:  I'm sorry, went on so long.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A 45-mile stretch of highway in Northern  California remains closed because of the Delta wildfire.  Cheryl Casone  with the detail, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, it's I-5, Maria.  Pretty  busy highway, it stretches near the Oregon border.  And it's closed for a  fifth day right now as the fire still out control since Wednesday.  It's  devoured 64 square miles.  And it's five percent contained right now.  </p><p>Officials say, thousands of destroyed trees, some 70 feet tall could fall  onto the highway that runs from Mexico all the way to Canada.  Truckers who  rely heavily on I-5 were forced to either wait out the fire or take a  crowded detour that adds 115 extra miles to their trip.  </p><p>Well, Amazon -- get ready New Yorkers, is planning to open its cashier less  convenience store in New York City.  The company is currently running three  Amazon Go stores in Seattle.  Not clear when or where more importantly the  store is going to be.  But the company also has Amazon Go stores right now  that operate in Chicago and San Francisco.  Remember, this is cashier less.   You go in, pack up your bag, you walk out right out.  Shares of Amazon  higher in the premarket, up almost one percent.  </p><p>And then there is \"The Nun\", successfully scaring off all the competition  at the box office over the weekend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What did you see?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I saw a nun.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  \"The Nun\" is actually the latest in a conjuring franchise.  It's a  series of movies actually.  And it's really helping Warner Brothers Studios  maintain domination at the box office.  They earn the top spot for the  fifth consecutive week.  \"The Nun\" brought in $53.5 million, a whopper --  whopping $131 million globally, that's pretty big.  </p><p>\"Crazy Rich Asians\" also from Warner Brothers fell to number two.  But it  brought in $13.6 million this weekend.  Still a big hit.  \"Peppermint\"  which stars Jennifer Garner made 13.3 million.  Rounding out the top five  were \"The Meg\" Maria and \"Searching\".  </p><p>People like to be scared.  I don't get it, but they like to be scared at  the box office.  Good for them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Apparently.</p><p>CARTER:  I hate scary movies.  </p><p>CASONE:  Me too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No scary movies for you, Lee. </p><p>CARTER:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, thank you Cheryl and Lee.</p><p>Coming up, a wild comeback, we have the highlights after Aaron Rodgers  leads the Packers to victory, that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A wild win for the Green Bay Packers.  Jared Max  with all the highlights.  Jared, good morning. </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  High drama  last night at Lambeau Field.  What a game for Aaron Rodgers.  Back from an  injury, that buried the Packers' hopes last season.  The Packers'  quarterback goes down in the second quarter and suffers a knee injury.  He  had to be carted off the field.  Packers fell behind 20-0 against the  Bears.  But in the end, it was a beautiful day in Mr.  Rodgers  neighborhood, came back into the game and threw one, two, three touchdown  passes in the last quarter.  75-yard connection that we will see with  Randall Cobb which gives the Packers their game winning touchdown with just  over two minutes to go.  They topped the Bears, 24-23.  </p><p>Remember Canadian George Carlin's argument that unlike baseball, football  gets played in any weather.  Not so any more.  Three games this week  delayed by threats of lightning.  Dolphins-Titans game lasted seven hours,  10 minutes, longest in NFL history.  Four hours delays, Dolphins won 27-20.  </p><p>Now, while Kenny Stills caught a touchdown, he made the headlines because  Colin Kaepernick tweeted support for Stills and his teammate Albert Wilson.   He called them brothers.  The only two players in the NFL who kneeled  yesterday.  Now some others protested but fewer than 10 in all among nearly  1400 in uniform protested.  </p><p>By the way, no new policy expected this season on the national anthem  policy in the NFL.  </p><p>In response to Nike teaming up with Colin Kaepernick, the mayor of Kenner  Louisiana has instructed his town's recreational department to not buy any  Nike products.  </p><p>Men's final at the U.S. open, Novak Djokovic beat Juan Marin del Potro in  straight sets to win his third title at Flushing Meadows.  He ties Pete  Sampras with 14 Grand Slam titles.  </p><p>Now, Serena Williams did not win her 24th Grand Slam singles title  Saturday.  She lost handily to 20-year-old Naomi Osaka and then blamed the  umpire for being sexist because she believed he issued her code violations  that she said would not have been given to men who would have reacted with  such contempt or emotion.  Serena was fined $17,000.  </p><p>Now, the chief of the WTA, The Women's Tennis I -- he believes that there  should be no difference in the standards of tolerance provided to the  emotions expressed by men versus women.  And said we do not believe that  this was done last night.  It's a story everybody's talking about, Maria.  </p><p>LI:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You were there.  </p><p>LI:  I was there this weekend.  And I saw that breakdown on court and  people were just wondering what was going on.  But I think in the end, the  biggest victim in the women's final is Naomi Osaka, her moment was stolen,  her first ever Grand Slam.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I totally agree with you.  She had a moment.  She should have  been celebrating.</p><p>LI:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  She won.  </p><p>LI:  Exactly.</p><p>MAX:  The crowd booed her.</p><p>CARTER:  And the crowd booed her.  I mean, that to me is absolute  absolutely unacceptable.  </p><p>MAX:  Same crowd -- same crowd who gave the biggest cheers during the  Serena-Venus match to Colin Kaepernick who was shown on the screen.  Just,  you know --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just saying.</p><p>MAX:  Just saying.  </p><p>MURPHY:  We paid a lot of money to watch Serena over the years.  She's won  so many tournaments and a lot of it is her emotion, you know, her desire,  her drive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.</p><p>MURPHY:  So, if -- so, I don't agree with how she reacted to the umpire.   But in the heat of the battle, we've watched it for years in tennis.  These  things happen.</p><p>CARTER:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you say it was sexism though when the winner was also a  woman?  </p><p>LI:  Well, I think it's because of what she said, she called the umpire a  thief.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  A thief.</p><p>LI:  And we know the other champions have called the umpire worst.  I think  it's the umpire who's -- should not be inserting himself into a  championship.</p><p>MAX:  She might be the greatest tennis player -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  (CROSSTALK)</p><p>LI:  I don't know if it's sexism.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>LI:  But I just don't think he should have gone in there.  </p><p>MAX:  She might be the greatest tennis player in the world.  I don't think  she's the greatest champion.  And I think she's proven that again.  She  needs to look in the mirror when she's losing and not lash out at others.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Too bad.  Jared, thank you.  </p><p>Catch Jared sports reports on Fox News Headlines, 24/7 or on Radio Sirius  XM 115.</p><p>Still ahead, the future of Alabama.

Happy Monday.  I'm  Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, September 10th.  Your top stories right  now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Moonves is out, the CEO of CBS stepping  down as more sexual misconduct charges surface.  More women coming forward.</p><p>The turmoil throwing a possible ranting to the CBS-Viacom merger.  All the  details this morning.  And the stock is up 1-1/4 percent on this news.   Broader market looking good.  Futures indicating a gain at the start of  trading.  We are just shy at the high of the morning but nonetheless  showing a gain on the Dow of about 90 points, one-third of a percent  higher.  S&amp;P 500 up a third of a percent as well, and the NASDAQ up 39  points, one-half of a percent.</p><p>This as the major market indices closed lower on Friday across the board.   As you can see, worst performer Dow Industrials down a third of a percent,  80 points lower.  In Europe this morning, a bit of a firmer stance there as  well.  Markets are up across the board with the CAC quarante in Paris and  the DAX Index in Germany each up two-thirds of one percent.  Asian markets  were mixed overnight, mostly lower.</p><p>The Hang Seng and the Shnghai indices losing better than one percent a  piece.  Peril in Paris this morning, seven people have now been injured in  a knife attack in the City of lights.  We got the very latest this morning  as Paris gets attacked again.  Sour Apple, the House that jobs built says  that the China tariffs will affect prices, in other words, prices are going  up.  What the President says could be an easy fix coming up.</p><p>And that's it.  Alibaba founder Jack Ma announcing that he is stepping down  as CEO of the company's next moves all coming up.  All those stories coming  up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, our own Susan  Li is here, along with the CEO and managing partner of Rosecliff, Mike  Murphy, pollster and President of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter  joining us as well.  Great to see you.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Monday.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Happy Monday.</p><p>MIKE MURPHY, CEO &amp; MANAGING PARTNER, ROSECLIFF CAPITAL:  Good morning,  Maria.  Happy Monday.</p><p>LI:  You know, I have trade concerns on my mind today because I saw the  Asian markets overnight and there was overhang because Apple, you know, the  employee indirectly 1.3 million people but if a big company like Apple,  they may be revert some of their chains back elsewhere.  I mean, that's a  big concern globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You made a really good point earlier that when you -- when the  President says, oh, just build phones at home --  </p><p>LI:  -- organic, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Turn the ship around.</p><p>LI:  No, no, no.  So it's going to take a while because they assembled most  of their iPhones -- well, all of their iPhones in China.  And a company  that assembling Foxconn was just, you know, the factory in Wisconsin for a  few billion dollars.  They fell to a two-year low.  So it shows you that  suppliers, there are concerns about trade and ramifications if indeed those  tariffs go into effect on a $500-billion trading relationship between China  and the U.S.</p><p>CARTER:  And you said Apple employs 1.3 million -- </p><p>LI:  Indirectly.</p><p>CARTER:  Indirectly 1.3 million people --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- engineers, all things related to the production.  </p><p>LI:  Right.</p><p>MURPHY:  Two-year low at Foxconn may be because manufacturing is going to  happen here in the U.S. instead of over in China.  So --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You think maybe this is going to encourage? </p><p>MURPHY:  I think for sure it will, it has to, Apple needs to make money.   They have a responsibility to shareholders to be the most profitable  company they can be if it's cheap -- it ends up being cheaper to the  manufacturing here in the U.S., that's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see.  Well, the President has put it out there now from  manufacturing those phones in the U.S.  We're covering that this morning.   And our top story this morning is the strong economy and a tough stance,  President Trump threatening tariffs on over $200 billion dollars in Chinese  imports as United States receives a strong jobs' report on Friday.  Here  now is the White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley.</p><p>Hogan, good to see you this morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, WHITE HOUSE DEPUTY PRESS SECRETARY:  Hey.  Great to be with  you, Maria.  Thanks so much for the time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What is timetable for the potential tariffs against China?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, I don't want to get ahead of the President obviously.  I was  standing right next to him on Air Force One when he told the press pool  exactly what he was thinking and that was he has billions of dollars,  hundreds of billions in fact in the hopper ready to go.  As you know the  President wants an equal playing field for trade with China and others  around the world.  And he'll do what he can to make sure that happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what would you say in terms of what we could see next?  I  mean, we know that the President has successfully dealt with Mexico but  we're waiting to see if Canada follows suit and you've got colleagues in  Europe this morning dealing with the Europeans.  What can you tell us?</p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I mean the President had some breakthroughs with  President Juncker here at the White House with the E.U., he's had  breakthroughs with Mexico, he's dealing with Canada as we speak.  China get  that deal done as well, you know, we came do a bilateral agreement with  Mexico.  The President has said many times, he wants Canada in that deal  but he wants the deal to be fair for Americans.</p><p>And if it's not going to be and Canada does not want to play ball then  they'll have to get it alone and the President will join with Mexico and  they'll keep that deal in place.  He wants more people brought to the  table, he wants to trade barriers eliminated, he want some gone.  He  believes our farmers, our workers can compete against anybody around the  globe.  The problem is we've got to have those tariffs come down.</p><p>And the President is going to fight for the Americans -- and the American  workers and American businesses to make sure that happens.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, are you expecting another deal to be announced before the  midterm elections, Hogan?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  I'm not sure.  You know, the President has said it's close, I  don't want to guess or pontificate on what close means.  But the President  in all of those trade deals and those negotiations, he wants them to be  pro-American.  He understands other countries have to success too.  He's  not anti-Mexico or anti-Canada.  In fact, he says on every occasion he can  that he wants them to succeed too.</p><p>But it can't be at the cost of the American people, and that's what he's  here to protect. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about this potential looming government shutdown  if that's still the case.  The journal this morning is reporting  Congressional leaders are expected to secure a deal today on three separate  spending bills avoiding a partial government shutdown by the end of the  month.  Will the President get the funding for the border wall and if the  funding is not in this upcoming budget end of September, do you think that  hurts Republicans going into the midterms?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Look, I think it hurts all Americans when our country isn't safe  and that's what this President swore an oath to protect the American people  first and foremost.  He wants border security, he's talked about how he  wants that whether it'd be a border wall, whether it's ending chain  migration and other pillars that he's discussed in the past.  Democrats  chose to shut the government down.</p><p>And they chose actually quite frankly to stand up for hundreds of thousands  of people who are here illegally and unlawfully as opposed to hundreds of  millions of Americans citizens.  That's what blows my mind.  It's not worry  about Democrat versus Republican, it's about the American people.  The  President has promised to protect them and he wants Congress to come to the  table to provide the funding to do that.</p><p>Right now we have a porous border; it's the worst immigration laws in the  world.  He's made that quite clear.  People are poring across the border.   You have drug lords, child trafficking, human trafficking coming across  this border into this country.  It's a very dangerous situation and  Democrats don't want to solve it.  The President wants a lasting solution  and will fight with Congress to get it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do Republicans want to solve it?  I mean, do you think  Republicans are onboard with this President in terms of making sure the  money is there is to secure the borders? </p><p>GIDLEY:  They sure seem like they are, they talk about it incessantly on  the campaign trail, the proof that was n the pudding, you got to put the  money out in order to protect the American people.  The President ran on  that, he was elected on that.  And I believe quite frankly a lot of  Republicans were elected on that too.  So, hopefully they join with this  President to protect the American people because that's what this is all  about.</p><p>It's not about limiting numbers or some crazy scheme to keep people out of  this country.  The President says he loves immigration, he just wants it to  be fair, he wants it to be reasonable, he wants it to protect American  citizens but he also wants it to be based on merit, he wants people to come  to this country.  If they want to come here he wants them to assimilate.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY:  Learn language but contribute to society and not be a drain on it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you think the rhetoric coming out of the President's  office these days is a little less in terms of we will shut the government  down if we don't have funding for the border wall.  If the money is not  there, the President last week when he was in Montana spoke to Pete Hegseth  sounded more realistic in terms of, look, we don't want to shut it down  right before the midterm elections.  Is that what you're hearing from the  President now?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, look, I was standing next to him in that interview and the  subsequent one on the plane ride home and he said listen, I don't want to  shut down to happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GIDLEY:  But I'm willing to fight and do what it takes politically to  protect the American people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So no shutdown? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, I don't know what form that's going to take.  I just know  the President is going to push to protect the American people regardless.   It's not necessarily about a shutdown before the midterm or afterwards,  it's about coming up in a lasting solution, that's what he wants.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you about the Intel investigations into what took  place in the 2016 election year, the White House is expected now people  talking about the President to declassify documents related to the  government surveillance of former aide Carter Page and more on what DOJ  official Bruce Ohr knew regarding ties to the Steele dossier.  Lindsey  Graham was on with me yesterday, here is what he said on \"Sunday Morning  Futures.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA:  Somebody needs to watch those who  watch us.  So if I were the President for transparency sake, for oversight  sake, for reforming the Department of Justice and FBI to get a better  product in the future, I would I release this just to show what President  Obama said about how good his FBI and Department of Justice actually were  is a complete falsehood.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan, is the President willing to declassify the documents so  the American people can understand what took place in 2016?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Well, first of all, I want to congratulate you for classing up you  show what putting two South Carolinians this morning, myself and the  abstain Senator Lindsey Graham.  But I can tell you the President is  looking into it.  Look, it's obvious now; we've seen when the curtains pull  back what was going on that there was inherent bias at the highest levels  of the FBI against Donald Trump and for Hillary Clinton.</p><p>The President is looking at doing this but I don't have the announcement on  it at this time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me -- let me turn to this New York Times  anonymous op-ed and continued fallout there.  My sources are telling me the  President believes this is coming from national security.  What do you  think? </p><p>GIDLEY:  Look, I think this person is a coward, I think they're gutless, I  think they're deceitful, they're disgraceful, and they're showing their  true colors.  Someone who comes to this office everyday like myself, the  hundreds of people behind me and across the street here at the EOB, we come  proudly to serve this President.  This person is tarnishing thousands of  people in the Federal government who work and serve this President openly.</p><p>We're proud what we do here and the work this President has done.  And  what's so ridiculous about the op-ed was policy wise, the person said it  was all great.  He loved what the President was doing.  He just didn't like  the way he was doing.  Listen, the President was elected to shake up  Washington, D.C., he's done that, he's moving through policies at a record  pace.  You've seen it in the economy, you've seen it with ISIS, you've seen  it with wage growth, highest wage growth actually in the past year.</p><p>We had three percent wage growth which was the highest amount of growth in  the better part of a whole year.  Something that we hadn't seen in 10  years.  It's incredible what this President is doing.  And for someone to  come to this office every day, somewhere in the administration, and hide  behind some shady anonymous op-ed have the guts to come out and to say,  it's me, put your name on it.</p><p>And then the honorable thing to do as Vice President Pence said is to step  down.  Get out of the building, get out of whatever office or whatever hole  you work in because you're not doing the service to the American people,  you're sure not doing the service of this President.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think you're going to find out who it is?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  I think the reporters will probably find out who it is.  I'm not  sure that they're taking a liking to it.  It's kind of funny we've united  reporters against this action right now.  So many have told me they can't  believe The New York Times, the paper of record I might add let someone go  off the record and post this ridiculous op-ed.  So, I think they're looking  into it.  I think the reporters are going to find out who it is pretty  quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's interesting because the media -- the liberal media  certainly is driving the bus on, you know, for the Democrats going into the  midterm elections.  So, Hogan, how tough has it been to basically set the  tone for policy, make policy, of course, with Congress in the face of all  this resistance, what are you expecting for the midterms?  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Look, given the opportunity to cover policy or palace intrigue,  the media will cover palace intrigue nine times out of 10 and twice on  Sunday.  They could care less about the gains about the gains for the  average American out there.  You see blue collar, actually, workers across  country front page to The Washington Post today, they've seen an increase  in jobs for the first time in 30 years setting records in that one too.</p><p>They just don't want to cover the successes of the President, 93 percent of  the coverage against this President, it's negative and he's still able to  accomplish record-setting policies and record-setting time, he is  completely changed the fundamentals of politics but also of policy growth  and work.  So many people told when the President got elected, Washington,  D.C. would shape him and change him to some degree.</p><p>This President has done the opposite, he's changed this town.  As soon as  these we accomplish something, if it's 10:00 in the morning, he tweets  about another topic and we're off to the races on something else.  He  doesn't rest by doing one thing and patting himself on the back and going  across the country and gloating on it.  He actually keeps moving forward,  doing more things to the American people because it's about accomplishments  for real people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But this election is one of the most consequential we've  ever seen.  Will voters come out because of the economic strength they're  seeing or because of what they're reading in the mainstream media? </p><p>GIDLEY:  I hope they come out because they're not going to believe -- don't  believe you're lying eyes, your lying pocketbooks.  You're seeing more  money in your pockets, more jobs across this country, hundreds of thousands  of manufacturing jobs we're told would never come back, are coming back,  hundreds of thousands of construction jobs.  This President is getting it  done for the American people and I think they'll vote that way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Hogan.  We'll leave it there.  Great to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>GIDLEY:  Thanks so much for your time.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Hogan Gidley at the White House.  Coming up, horror in Paris.

At least five people are hurt this morning in a  shooting inside a nightclub in Memphis.  Cheryl Casone with the details.   Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  This happened at  the Purple Haze in downtown Memphis.  Happened about 3:30 a.m. today.   Memphis detectives are on the scene right now.  So far police haven't  released many details about what happened but reports say at least four  ambulances arrived at that club.  It's not known if the shooter is still at  large.  We're trying to get more details for you this morning.</p><p>Now to Paris in a horrific knife attack there.  Seven people including two  British tourists were injured during this attack in the French capital.   Police arrested a suspected who is reportedly from Afghanistan.  Witnesses  say the man was armed with a knife and a metal bar.  It is not currently  being treated though as a terrorist attack.</p><p>OK.  Back here at home, get ready here because here she comes, Hurricane  Florence rapidly gaining strength every hour as it's churning across the  Atlantic.  Right now Florence is a Cat Two Storm, maximum sustained winds  of 100 miles per hour, but it could slam to south east as a major  hurricane.  Later this week it could take Cat Four status.  South Carolina,  North Carolina, Virginia had already been declared states of emergency.  </p><p>Well, coming up.  Les Moonves is out.  We're talking about leadership  change at CBS following harassment allegations against the CEO, Maria.   Plus a lot more coming up.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Thank you, Cheryl.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CASONE:  I want to just go ahead and just start to tease -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much.</p><p>CASONE:  Because it's very important what's coming at the next story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take a break.  When we come back.  We're  talking to the CEO of Burrow about of how he started his couch-in-a-box  company from the ground up startup information next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>Baby let your hair hang down walk right in, step </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Taking inside the box, inside the box, that is Burrow, it's a  couch-in-a-box company promise to make your furniture shopping easier at a  fraction of the price.  Joining us right now is the start-up founder,  Burrow co-CEO and cofounder, Stephen Kuhl is here.  Stephen, good to see  you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>STEPHEN KUHL, CEO AND COFOUNDER, BURROW:  Thank you for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the idea that you were in school, you and a friend?</p><p>KUHL:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Two students to build this company.  Tell us about your  business model.  </p><p>KUHL:  So, if you've ever bought a sofa before you know how painful the  experience can be, the reason why most sofas cost so much money is mostly  because of the shipping.  They're big and bulky, can't be shipped in small  containers, we figured out a way to ship a high-end sofa in small  containers and boxes and that allows us to cutout several hundred dollars  of the shipping cost and also deliver a lot faster.  So you can order a  custom couch online and get it within a week or so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So are we putting it together when it -- when it gets to the  apartment?  </p><p>KUHL:  You do have to put it together yourself, it takes -- I promise you  it's very easy, it's matter of minutes.  It unfold --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I can't put anything together.  </p><p>KUHL:  I've had --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You say in matter of minutes it will -- it will all come  together?  </p><p>KUHL:  Yes.  No tools, no tools required.  </p><p>LI:  Oh, so it's not --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MURPHY:  I think you can do it, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>CARTER:  Tell me about name, why did you name it Burrow?</p><p>KUHL:  So, we wanted to do a word that was part of the English language  that people knew but didn't use every day so we can own it and Burrow to us  have the sense of cozyness in home and comfort to it.  So we like that  name.</p><p>LI:  So you have people to compare your company to Casper, the direct-to- consumer mattress company.</p><p>KUHL:  Yes.</p><p>LI:  You know, one with the enticing point about Casper amongst the  millennial group is that they will take back your mattress in 90 days or  100 days, no questions asked.  What about the return policy for couch in a  box?  </p><p>KUHL:  Yes.  So if you buy our sofa you have 30 days to try it out and then  you can return it.  If -- </p><p>LI:  Thirty days, that's it? Not a hundred.</p><p>KUHL:  We have 0-- we have very few returns but the ones that we do have  they happened very quickly.  I think with mattress you want to try it out  for a little while see if you're getting good sleep in for a sofa.  You'll  know right away it's very comfortable and it's just more like doesn't fir  or not.  </p><p>MURPHY:  So full disclosure, I've met Stephen before for Rosecliff  (INAUDIBLE) I love what you guys are doing now with -- so direct-to- consumer business and now you're opening a retail presence.  Can you tell  us a little bit about that?  Because I think it's really going to help your  business.</p><p>KUHL:  Yes.  You know, for our product in particular, you know, it takes a  lot of thought to purchase a sofa that costs over $1,000, and so we knew  very early on we wanted to have a physical space where you can try out the  product.  And for us, you know, we're noticing this big trend of all these  new brands launching experiential stores and I think that's really smart  and that's what we wanted to as well.  Consumers don't really want to just  browse products, if they want to do that, they can do it online.</p><p>We want to create a space for people can organically try out our products.   And so, what I mean by that is you can go hang out in this living room  environment and read a book, we'll give you a copy or a water.  We have a  movie theater in the basement where you can watch T.V.'s or -- T.V. shows  or movies.  Just kind of like really experience what it's like to sit on  our sofa.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me ask you, Steve, we're talking so much about trade.  In  May, you moved production from Mexico to Mississippi.  Why did you move  production?  </p><p>KUHL:  So, you know, we always wanted to produce in the U.S. and to be  honest with you when we started the company most U.S. manufactures kind of  laughed at us because they said you're going to use high quality materials  and ship a sofa in a box, that doesn't make any sense.  You guys have never  made furniture before, you don't know what you're doing.  So we went to --  we went to Mexico City through a business school classmate connection,  started producing there.</p><p>And then as soon as we had some traction, you know, those manufactures  reached back out to us and said, hey, I think you guys might be on to  something and so we're really happy to bring it back to the -- o the U.S. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it was just a coincidence not to get impacted by the  tariffs?  </p><p>KUHL:  It was not impacted by the tariffs.  We always -- we always did want  to produce in the U.S.  I think it's just -- it's just the right thing to  do.  You should improve the communities that you kind of live and operate  in.  And actually grew up in North Carolina when I was younger and so it  was really nice to get back down there and --</p><p>MURPHY:  Love that.</p><p>KUHL:  -- produce there.  Yes.</p><p>MURPHY:  Good for you.  That's awesome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Really good stuff.  Stephen, thanks so much for joining  us.  </p><p>KUHL:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.  Stephen Kuhl.  Check our Burrow, the  furniture company.  Coming up next.  A new face of Alibaba.  The major  changes coming to the Chinese retail giant.  Jack Ma announces his exit.   We will tell who is succeeding him.  And then there's this, Jim Carrey from  Dumb and Dumber is speaking out.  Why actor says Democrats should say yes  to socialism, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, September 10th,  your top stories right now, 8:31 on the East Coast.  Trade winds are  moving.  Futures higher this morning as U.S. companies prepare for more  trade negotiations with China.  The U.S. Representative for trade is also  in Europe, dealing with Mr. Juncker on a potential deal for the Europeans.   Market is expected to open higher this morning.  European markets also  higher.  Take a look FT-100 up a quarter of a percent, CAC Quarante up two- thirds of a percent, and the DAX in Germany, up one half of a percent.  </p><p>U.S. expected to open up about 80 points on Dow.  Asian markets were mixed  overnight.  Hang Seng in Hong Kong worst perform, down 1-1/3 percent.  Les  Moonves is stepping down.  The CBS CEO is out this morning, as more sexual  misconduct charges surface -- more women coming forward.  How the shake-up  will affect the company's Viacom merge plan.  Meanwhile, CBS is making more  legal movers with theatre chain national amusements.  All the details,  coming up in a moment. </p><p>Well, that is it.  Alibaba, Founder, Jack Ma, announcing he will step down  as CEO within the year.  The company's next moves, right here.  </p><p>And all righty then, why actor and comedian Jim Carrey is telling people to  stop apologizing for socialism.  Democrat should just agree.  We will talk  about that.  First, though, our top story this half an hour.  Bank on the  stump. Former President Obama returning to the campaign trail over the  weekend delivering a diatribe against his successor, accusing President  Trump and Republicans of fueling division and resentment.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It did not start with  Donald Trump.  He is a symptom not the cause.  He is just capitalizing on  resentments that politicians have been fanning for years.  When you hear  how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this  recovery started.  This should not be a partisan issue, to say that we do  not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice  system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow, Republicans are -- including South Carolina Senator  Lindsey Graham and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy pushed back against  Obama's remarks.  Here's what they told me yesterday on \"SUNDAY MORNING  FUTURES\".  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GRAHAM:  President Obama, it's not what you're making up, it's what you're  leaving out.  You're leaving out the fact your Attorney General Loretta  Lynch told the FBI director, don't call the Clinton e-mail investigation an  investigation, call it a matter.  You're forgetting to tell the public that  the number four at Department of Justice, Mr. Ohr -- Mr. Ohr, Bruce Ohr's  wife worked for Fusion GPS which was on the payroll by Democratic Party to  hire foreign agent to go to get dirt on candidate Trump and Russia.  </p><p>REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA), HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER:  Do you know, he had  eight years to try to solve this economy?  And his highest growth year is  still less than the worst year under Bill Clinton?  President Trump's  economy has grown 40 percent faster.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now is former Hillary for America Senior  Adviser and Democratic Strategist, Adrienne Elrod joining us; along with  former Communications Director for Trump Presidential Campaign, Republican  Strategist Bryan Lanza.  Great to see you both.  Thank you so much for  joining us.  </p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BRYAN LANZA, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST:  Good morning, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, your thoughts on President Obama hitting the campaign  trail and what you just heard from Kevin McCarthy and Lindsey Graham in  response.  </p><p>ELROD:  Yes, well I'm really excited that President Obama -- it should come  as no surprise, of course -- I'm excited that he's hitting the campaign  trail, he's going to be going to campaign for a lot of candidates,  especially those in swing states where somebody like him, one of our top  surrogate in the Democratic party coming in, will make a huge difference,  and might possibly turn the race in their favor.  So, there's nobody better  on the campaign stump right now than President Obama decides, perhaps, his  wife, Michelle Obama.  </p><p>It's wonderful to see him out here.  In regards to comments by Lindsey  Graham and Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans who have criticized him for  hitting the trail and also criticizing him for some of the things that he  said in his speech, you know, I think these guys are panicked.  Again,  President Obama, does very well with independents, there's nobody better  when it comes to turning out the vote in getting more progressives to turn  out to the polls and that's exactly what we need right now going into the  midterms.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think it's odd that President Obama would say don't  politicize your government agencies when we all know that's exactly what he  did, particularly looking at what happened at the top of the FBI, the top  of the DOJ, go back all the way to the beginning of his presidency when the  IRS was targeting conservatives, Adrienne?  </p><p>ELROD:  You know, Maria, I'm more forced on his aspirational message that  he advocated, not only when he gave a speech on Friday but, of course, when  he was in Anaheim, California over the weekend.  When he reminded us that  when we all come together -- by the way, Republicans as well, when we all  participate in our democracy our country is better off for it that's what  I'm more excited about.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, it's so blaring and glaring what happened in 2016  election.  Bryan, Florida Senator Marco Rubio fired back after President  Obama's speech showing that it was actually Obama who pushed divisiveness  while in office.  Rubio wrote a series of tweets over the weekend saying  this: \"President Obama is right, it is wrong for President to use divisive  language such as; one, call on all opponents of same sex marriage bigots.   Number two, call the pro-life movement a war on women.  Number three, call  on immigration enforcement advocates racist.  Call the GOP, the enemy of  Hispanics.\"  </p><p>Rubio then pulled out a quote from Obama dating back to 2008, he writes:  \"Barack Obama on people left behind by the new economy: 'And it's not  surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or  antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or  anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.\"  Bryan, your  take at any the critique.  </p><p>LANZA:  You know, it's a fair critique.  Senator Rubio is right.  Let's not  remember -- let's remember one thing: Senator Obama never had a successful  midterm election.  You know, he hollowed up the Democratic Party's bench  for the better part of a generation because his policies just didn't work  for America.  And I think it's good that he's on the trail; we actually get  to compare the policies of Obama to what the future of the Democratic Party  is to President Trump.  I mean, let's look at small businesses, let's look  at consumer confidence, let's look at the jobs that were created in areas  that have been hollowed out and left behind.  I'm comfortable having this  debate about economy with President Obama.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, look, the recovery certainly started under President  Obama in 2009, but when President Trump came in and rolled back regulation  and lowered taxes, you saw a real acceleration.  And now, we just saw two  quarters of four percent plus growth.  </p><p>LANZA:  Yes, he super charged the economy with his policies.  I mean, you  see it with small businesses, you know, at this record pace that is  starting to grow.  Remember, during the Obama administration, small  businesses creation nearly stopped.  That wasn't hope, that was  hopelessness.  And what they see, what we see now with the small business  community and the middle-income -- middle America is hope and opportunity  again with Trump's policies.  We super charged the economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, what about the lack of a message here?  Because, I  understand you know, you want to see the President Obama come out and sort  of be rah-rah for party, but what are they actually fighting for, what is  the -- other than abolish ICE resist this President, impeach 45, according  to Maxine Waters, what's the actual policy that they're trying to  communicate going into November?  </p><p>ELROD:  The actual policy, Maria, is we want to -- Democrats want to raise  wages, we want to fix -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wages are up -- </p><p>ELROD:  not everyone is seeing it, not everybody seeing.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Under President Trump.  We just had the jobs number out Friday  and wages are up three percent year-over-year.  </p><p>ELROD:  The average American worker is not seeing that.  So, we want to  raise wages.  We want to fix, not repeal, health care, and we want to clean  up corruption in Washington.  I also want to keep -- I want all of us to  keep in mind here that a lot of the candidates who have won -- these  Democratic candidates who have won these special elections out there in  America, ran on protecting health care.  </p><p>So, we have a message, yes, when you have President Trump, he knows how to  manipulate news cycle every single day.  It's often times hard to get our  affirmative message out there, but it does exist.  And that is why you're  seeing some of these localized races where Democrats had turned red seats  to blue.  They are running on a very strong message on protecting health  care, raising wages, and returning Washington back to more -- where more --  democracy exists.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bryan?</p><p>LANZA:  Yes, I mean, the only message I hear is hate Trump.  It's race  baiting at the best possible chance that they get.  I mean, their message  is loss.  I think if we're going to draw comparisons, I think the vote,  this election is going to be about results of a resistance.  I think the  American people is going to love to say what's happened in the last two  years and say we're happy, we're pleased with the progress, we want more.   And I think the compare and contrast is going to be very important.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LANZA:  I mean, like I said, this election is going to be as a result of a  resistance.  And there's a reason why results matter; we're delivering on  our promises.  </p><p>ELROD:  So, Bryan, does that mean you think that Republicans are going to  hold on to the house?  </p><p>LANZA:  I think they're going to fight very hard.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They may hold on to the house.</p><p>LANZA:  Listen, I hope they do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>LANZA:  We're all working hard to make sure that happens.  But I think the  reason we're going to do that is because results are starting to matter to  the American people.  It's an upHill battle to begin with: midterms are  always difficult for incoming Presidents.  I mean, that's just the way it's  been historically.  But when you have is this President who's going out in  the fall and campaigning on his record, most Presidents hide. </p><p>I mean, Obama didn't campaign on his Obamacare health care record.  In  2010, when he ran, he ran and hid.  This President's embracing this  economy.  He's embracing the success and he's saying let's vote on what  matters.  Let's look at our pocketbooks and see if things have been better  off.  And I think the American public says yes, they have been.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, you mentioned a couple of these local races where  Democrats have been victorious, but a lot of Democrats that are winning are  all the way to the left.  And one message that keeps coming up through is  socialism.  Jim Carrey, among them, urging Democrats to embrace socialism,  and that's what we keep hearing from these far-left candidates like  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Here's Jim Carrey this weekend, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BILL MAHER, COMEDIAN AND HOST:  The Republicans are running with the word  socialism.  They're trying to say --</p><p>JIM CARREY, ACTOR AND COMEDIAN:  Trying to scare people.  </p><p>MAHER:  Scare people.</p><p>CARREY:  It's communism.  We have to say yes to socialism to the word and  everything.  We have to stop apologizing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your reaction, Adrienne?  Say yes to socialism, like Jim  Carrey says?  </p><p>ELROD:  No, absolutely not, Maria.  I mean, first of all, this is Bill  Maher, who is one of more progressive talk show hosts, if you will, he has  a show, of course, on HBO.  Number two, yes, we have a big tent party; we  are winning races, some of these candidates define themselves as being  Democratic socialists are winning some of these races, but, again, it's  important to keep that in mind that we're a big tent party with a lot of  ideas.  I personally do not, do not agree with socialism, that's why I  supported Hillary Clinton and worked on her campaign and not Bernie  Sanders.  So, we are a big tent party.  And truly, Democrats have more in  common than they don't -- we're a very large party.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But isn't it true -- I mean, Nancy Pelosi was out recently  saying we want to reverse the tax cut plan.  I mean, she basically said, we  want to raise taxes.  If the Democrats get in -- get the house and get the  majority, they will raise taxes and move to impeach Donald Trump and move  to abolish ICE, isn't that what they've been promising?  </p><p>ELROD:  Well, I think what Democrats will do if we take back the House,  also, by the way, there's a very good chance that we'll take back Senate,  as we will focus on reversing the tax cuts, that they are more spread  broadly to all Americans as opposed to just those at the top.  And that is  something that absolutely will happen --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The tax cut plan is not owned for those at the top.  That's  just not true.  That is a democratic talking point and it's a lie.  </p><p>ELROD:  Well -- that's, that's where you stand, Maria, and not where I  stand.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, how do you say that the tax cuts only impacted the  top?  What's your explanation for it because it's not true, explain it.  </p><p>ELROD:  One of my explanations is the fact that the corporate tax cut is  permanent and tax cuts in middle class permanent, they're only 10 years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  And the President Obama, also wanted to lower the  corporate tax rate, which he said a lot, a lot during his term, because  when you lower the corporate tax rate that encourages corporations to  increase jobs, which is why we're at a 3.9 percent unemployment rate.  </p><p>ELROD:  Well, again, when you look at numbers here, Maria, more wealthy  Americans benefited by this tax cut, than your average middle-class family.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bryan, that's -- the tax cuts were very broad-based.  In fact,  a big portion of people pay no tax, and the tax rates go down in every  income level up to the top.  Brian your thoughts.  </p><p>LANZA:  Listen, Jim Carrey, you know, almost ruin \"The Batman\" movie  series.  You cannot let him ruin American with his belief that socialism is  good.  I mean, that's just a reality.  I think we had Adrienne in  agreement.  Now, the tax policy is what it is.  It's an effective plan, I  think people are seeing the impact in their taxes almost immediately.  I  think you are seeing consumer confidence expand.  I think the problem the  Democrats have is they sort of pull up the old playbook and say, hey, we  want to raise wages, so can say that every year.  But what they haven't  done because they've been so focused on trying to beach Trump for the last  two years, they've ignored economy -- wages have gone up.  </p><p>I mean, if you look at economic success that the Democrats sort of hide and  put their head in the sand said, this isn't happening, we only care about  impeachment.  Of course, you're going to get sort of this viewed that no  progress has been made, but results over resistance has taken place, and  the results are the economy is thriving right now because of strong  economic policy, and deregulatory policies that help middle income here in  Orange County, here in Anaheim, here in Santa Ana.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know how you run on raising taxes, but I will give you  this, Adrienne, the taxes on hedge fund managers and others in terms of  that capital gains that was certainly one thing that was fought and that  was certainly something that could have been changed and should have.  But  in terms of the overall tax cut plan, there's no doubt that it is broad- based.  We'll keep watching the impact -- I just don't understand how you  run on raising taxes, Adrienne.  </p><p>ELROD:  I don't think we're raising on -- running on raising taxes at all.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, reversing tax cut plan would raise taxes.  </p><p>ELROD:  OK.  Well, we're running on protecting health care and raising  wages, we're cleaning up corruption.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Adrienne, thank you so much.  Adrienne Elrod and Bryan Lanza  there.  Stay with us back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  CBS shares are up this morning premarket after  CEO Les Moonves resigned amid new allegations of sexual misconduct.  Nicole  Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange this morning.  Nic,  good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So,  this is a story that keeps developing, and so now, Less Moonves has  resigned.  This came on Sunday.  You see CBS is up three percent this  morning, also settling with Shari Redstone and also the National Amusements  control and shareholder Shari Redstone herself and the media company itself  for the control of that company.  The big story is that there are more  allegations, and what will happen also to his package, the -- one of the  greatest pieces of news is that, of course, we know he went from 180  million, down to 100 million, down to 20 million.  What would his package  be?  And now, they're actually saying, in fact, that it could be 120  million if they don't find cause for his termination.  There were also some  board changes and 13 people on the board now left.  Back to you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nicole, thank you so much.  Switching gears, let's  get to Stuart Varney.  It has been two years since Hillary Clinton made  this infamous comment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  You can put  half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Then-presidential candidate Clinton made the comments on  September 9th, 2016.  Joining us now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\"  Stuart Varney to weigh in.  Stu, good morning to you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Oh, I'm still as angry now as  I was two years ago as of yesterday.  And you know, the clip you ran there  was basket of deplorables.  It actually was worse than that because she  spelled it out, she says, Trump supporters -- half of Trump supporters are  racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.  I remember when she  said it.  It really annoyed me, and I think probably annoyed 100 million  Americans along with me.  Because look, I've got a multiracial family.  In  my family, we have people from -- look, we've got three races in my family,  African, Asian, Caucasian, we've got two religions, Christianity, Judaism.   I've got various ethnic nationality -- ethnic backgrounds, Ethiopian,  Chinese, German, New Zealand, Australia, England, America, et cetera, et  cetera.  We are a very American family.  I think we're very typical of so  many American families.  And along comes a Presidential candidate and says  you're just a bunch of deplorables.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  It was a terrible move, and really annoyed me.  And I find it  interesting that two years on, we now see the return of Barack Obama to the  campaign trail.  I mean, it's like deja vu all over again, isn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It certainly did hurt her in the election, that's for  sure.</p><p>VARNEY:  I think so.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, I know you'll have a lot more about it in about nine  minutes' time.  We'll see you at the top of the hour.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\"  begins 9:00 a.m. Eastern, join Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  Back in a  moment, right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, amid the rain and the wind, 45 employees from Fox and Fox  Business raised money to fight breast cancer this weekend at the Susan G.  Komen Race for the Cure.  Gerri Willis led it.</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  That's right.  So, despite the  rain, the wind, the weather was not great, we had a terrific outing, and  just amazing support.  Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>WILLIS:  Welcome to the Komen Greater New York City race for cure.  On  Sunday, more than 10,000 runners and walkers from the New York area came to  Central Park to support breast cancer survivors, their families, and those  in treatment.</p><p>One in eight women will get a breast cancer diagnosis in their lifetime.   Every year, the event draws people for a number of reasons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Team Gerri go!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Team Gerri!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Go Team Gerri!</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Go Team Gerri!  Whoa!</p><p>WILLIS:  The Fox team well-represented by some of the network's biggest  stars.</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  I have a lot of people in my  own life as well, who have had scary incidents.</p><p>LIZ CLAMAN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I don't care if it's raining.   We're shining.  This is awesome.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK SPORTS ANCHOR:  Gerri!  Gerri!</p><p>SANDRA SMITH, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST:  It's a lot of fun and it's just such  an awesome cause.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Gerri Willis has been a real inspiration for all of us,  and she's pushed and she's pushed and she's pushed.  So, we're out to  support her and the great cause that she represents.</p><p>WILLIS:  This year, those impacted directly include men, 15 first  responders and office workers who are downtown during 9/11 have been  diagnosed with breast cancer.  Many people suffer but on Sunday, we  celebrated them, supported them, and let them now we care.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>WILLIS:  And that's the first time I've seen that package.  We put it  together but I haven't seen the whole thing together, so amazing.  In the  end, we have raised $75,126 right now.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WILLIS:  And altogether, this event will probably generate about $2.5  million for breast cancer.  As you know, Komen supports both research and  helping women get mammograms in New York communities which I think is such  an important thing.  If you still want to give <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.komennyc.org/fox\">www.komennyc.org/fox</url>, you  can still give for a couple of weeks here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, that's great.  Gerri, thank you so much for your leadership  on this.</p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really important.  Gerri Willis, thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show, you guys.  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>MURPHY:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>CARTER:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Mike Murphy, Lee Carter, great to see you.</p><p>CARTER:  Thank you.  Always great to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day, everybody.  Go seize that day.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" begins now.  Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Seize the day.  I'll seize it, I tell you.  Good morning, Maria.   And good morning, everyone.  Trade worries?  What trade worries?  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Thanks to our multi-trillion dollar tech sector - and not just big tech, but hundreds of new entrepreneurial online services - commerce kept flowing, food was available on the shelves, gas was in the tanks, packages were delivered and paychecks were processed.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>It was the nimbleness, knowhow and infrastructure built by our pioneering tech giants that enabled the tens of thousands of small tech firms to come to our rescue in tough times. Our auto and trucking companies, our construction firms, our steel and oil and gas industries, hospitals, media and food processing are all dependent on the kind of inventory and supply chain management made possible by the gig economy. In many ways, the success and array of business-to-business services provided at very low cost (often for free) by companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and the like is what makes possible the next generation of tech firms that could through free market competition race past these giants.\u00a0 Innovation stops monopolies, not government lawyers.</p><p>Here are a few examples of tech innovation that kept the American economy afloat and will help keep us protected from germs and disease in the future: online shopping and delivery which depends on a robust digital logistics system. Digital payment systems. Online conference systems. Information security. Supply chain management. Robotics. Internet platforms. Telemedicines.\u00a0</p><p>A new report from the <url normalizedValue=\"https://digitallyempowered.connectedcouncil.org/\">Connected Commerce Council</url>, which analyzed the impact of digital tools on small businesses in the COVID-19 crisis found almost one of three (31%) business owners say that without digital tools, they would have had to close all or part of their business during the crisis.\u00a0 Nearly 70% say digital tools have been useful during the COVID crisis.</p><p>There is now a loud call in both parties for multi-trillion dollar government \u201cinfrastructure bills.\u201d Wait a minute. Our most critical infrastructure today is digital economy connectivity through satellites, internet platforms, clouds, fiber optic cables,the sophisticated nationwide electric grid system, 5G technologies. This digital infrastructure is all being built out by the very tech and telecom companies that are now coming under fire for being too successful and making too much money.\u00a0</p><p>All of this, paradoxically, comes at a time when Americans are increasingly and rightfully fearful of the challenge to America's superpower status that has arisen from China. Beijing wants to dominate every aspect of 21st century technology through state-owned or subsidized companies like Huawei and Tik Tok. They want to knock Apple, Google and Microsoft off their perches as worldwide leaders. How foolish would it be for America's political class to assist the Chinese in that effort? Equally questionable is why conservatives, who are warning every day of the economic and national security threat posed by China, want to handcuff American companies with antitrust suits and regulation.</p><p>Germany, France, Russia and China would love to be home base for these tech giants. They aren't because no nation can rival the United States in innovation and entrepreneurship - whether that comes from Silicon Valley or main street USA.\u00a0</p><p>Conservatives are angry over big tech's political advocacy and liberal slant. Liberals see tech companies as too profitable and successful.\u00a0</p><p>But without them, America's economy would be flat on its back right now. What we need is a bipartisan consensus that the technology and the digital revolution advanced by companies from Apple to Amazon to Google are what make America number one and enhance our freedom and free market prosperity.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Stephen Moore is a senior fellow at FreedomWorks and is a member of President Trump's Economic Recovery Task Force.

The hypocrisy of some commentators and competitors is there for all to see with the most vocal critics being rather muted in the wake of an Aussie swimmer testing positive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While we may pride ourselves on a \"clean \" attitude to sporting performance, we sometimes get it wrong and should be more wary of taking a vociferous high ground as some have done. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Max Redmayne, Russell Lea </emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine you're a champion swimmer. You've won medals. You're in the Australian swim team including relay teams with mates who you'd never want to let down (\"Some doping cases down to athletes slipping up, says swimming CEO\", July 30).</p><p>You have a manager, coaches, strength trainers, masseurs, dieticians, sports psychologists, all at your disposal. You know you'll be drug tested frequently. Surely you or your people would document everything you eat, drink or inject wouldn't you, just in case? - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Egan, Mosman</emphasis></p><p>It's a well-established scientific fact that Australian sports people don't take drugs, unless it's inadvertent. This allows them to always protest from a position of strength (\"Athletes told to assume any supplement they take could be tainted\", July 30).</p><p>But two questions. Why do super-fit sports people anywhere need to take supplements? Why aren't good old fruit and vegies enough? - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Macdonald, Kings Langley</emphasis></p><p>I thought our athletes were role models for healthy good living, exercise, discipline and good food. So why the \"supplements\"? - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Patricia Armati, Rose Bay</emphasis></p><p>How about bringing competitive swimming (and in fact all competitive sports) back to a level playing field and ban athletes from using all supplements. Problem solved. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helen Simpson, Curl Curl</emphasis></p><p>I'm a big fan of the swim team but I am underwhelmed by our response to the failed dope test from one of our swimmers. We are very quick to point the finger at other nations and individuals when they have similar failures but from our high moral ground we seem to think any transgression by our swimmers must be a mistake. The defence is always the same. There must be a lot of tainted supplements out there. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pauline Paton, Centennial Park </emphasis></p><p>The complexity of this case, and perhaps many other cases of doping, should mean that in the intense heat of competition coaches and officials on all levels need to help sports people under pressure to understand this complexity and help them focus on their best work.</p><p>It seems a trust deficit exists among the stakeholders, and hearsay and suspicions overtake good sense. It's not the fault of any particular person but is the way governing bodies including Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) communicate their roles and systems to the sports grassroots: the athletes.</p><p>Wisdom and counselling for these young people from those at the top of their sport including ASADA should be transparent and fair, to help educe the stress, worry and suspicions and avoid precipitous actions. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Christopher Hill, Kensington</emphasis></p><p>The moral: Olympic swimmers at pool podiums shouldn't make waves. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edward Loong, Milsons Point</emphasis></p><p>Mismanagement of stadium rebuild would see a normal business fined</p><p>If the Berejiklian government was actually a business, with its ministers the board of directors and we, the people, its shareholders, the actions of those directors in respect of the totally mismanaged handling of the multimillion-dollar contracts for the demolition and rebuild of the Sydney Football Stadium, for example, would almost certainly see those directors being either heavily fined or even sent to jail (\"Stadium setback shows cost of planning on the run\", July 30).</p><p>As it is, they respond with a contemptuous shrug and an archetypal \"she'll be right\" response. I despair. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harvey Sanders, Paddington </emphasis></p><p>The new stadium is about to have its first major cost blow-out, yet the design remains a secret.</p><p>Covert dealings are business-as-usual for this government and we the taxpayers are after all just the clowns who get to pay for it.</p><p>To make the whole mess more palatable, we can expect a couple of meaningless but easily digested \"artists impressions\" coming our way soon. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Buckman, Enmore</emphasis></p><p>A suggestion for the Gladys government. Forget about moving the Powerhouse Museum and use the money saved towards the Sydney Football Stadium. Everyone wins. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barry Ffrench, Cronulla </emphasis></p><p>As I look at the photo of the remnants of the Sydney Football Stadium, I am reminded the people of NSW voted for this rubble. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Hayes, Port Macquarie</emphasis></p><p>Allianz Stadium is now rubble, with little chance the government will rebuild it to specifications without significant additional cost (\"Deal before design on new stadium\", July 30).</p><p>Delivery of new inter-urban trains requiring extensive platform and track modifications is delayed for more than six months because of design issues, despite their supposedly being bought \"off the shelf\" to save time and money.</p><p>Sydney's allegedly fully automated metro is brought to a halt by human error, with commuters stranded on the very first day that bus changes force many hundreds to switch from M2 bus to metro. Suddenly and strangely progress on the CBD light rail is looking comparatively bright. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug Walker, Baulkham Hills </emphasis></p><p>This government is so secretive that it's a joke for the Premier to comment: \"We won't be taken for a ride.\"</p><p>That's exactly what the people of NSW have been taken for over stadia, toll roads, metros, over-development and now poor building standards. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robin Humphrey, Springwood </emphasis></p><p>There were \"many good people\" who opposed the destruction and rebuild of the stadium in the first place. Now we have to listen to the Premier's weasel words in a lame justification of her inept decision and process. Bah humbug, I say. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Helen Lewin, Tumbi Umbi</emphasis></p><p>Churches' stance on abortion is an anachronism</p><p>Abortion legislation should be supported, not sabotaged, by churches (\"MPs act to bring abortion reform closer\", July 30). The writing is on the wall but, as usual, the Australian Christian Lobby can't read it.</p><p>After a traumatic journey, NSW legislation is about to catch up with the rest of the Australia but it is tragic that the same tax-exempt organisations that opposed legislative change to treat vulnerable people better are once again putting on the battle helmet instead of giving a helping hand. The Christian tradition has consistently arrived at the wrong conclusion when it places the words of a pre-enlightenment document in the driving seat, rather than the welfare of contemporary human beings .</p><p>Just as the marriage equality debate yesterday, abortion today and religious freedom tomorrow, an ethical navigation system that hasn't been updated for 2000 years will have us arriving at a series of stinking wheelie bins instead of positive community destinations. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fr Peter Macleod-Miller, St Matthews, Albury</emphasis></p><p>The Bill supports health and reproductive rights but must be voted down because it has no regard of the precious rights of the reproductive result. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ronald Mackinnon, Elizabeth Bay</emphasis></p><p>I appreciate Deborah Bateson's point that things can be made easier for women, but I just can't see whether the same work is being done to make things easier for the even more needy child in the womb (\"Abortion is healthcare, not a crime - and at last the law will catch up\", July 29). The article mentions women 10 times but children not once. And is a law to protect children in the womb ever really out-dated? - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Simon Manchester, Senior Minister, St Thomas' Anglican Church, North Sydney</emphasis></p><p>PM hedges his bets</p><p>It seemed a straightforward question in Parliament from the Greens to the Prime Minister regarding possible lobbying by his ministers for expedited visa processing for Chinese high-rollers intending to visit the Crown Casino (\"Lack of Crown scrutiny shows lobbying pays off\", July 30).</p><p>The PM's response was that \"there has been nothing presented to me that would indicate there are any matters there for me to address\".</p><p>Such weasel words are disrespectful of and an abrogation of accountability to the Parliament. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Russ Couch, Woonona </emphasis></p><p>It would seem our federal government had no qualms at all about facilitating visas for Chinese high-rollers to accommodate Crown.</p><p>This is a federal government that can't accommodate a few hundred bona fide refugees languishing on Manus Island. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mary Lawson, Marrickville </emphasis></p><p>Religious dogma is poisonous</p><p>As the religious freedom debate rages, it clearly all boils down to the misguided belief that \"my religion is better than yours\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/time-to-stop-crown-from-further-blighting-cityscape-20190729-p52bs5.html\">Letters</url>, July 30).</p><p>A timely reminder indeed of the late Christopher Hitchens immortal words: \"Religion poisons everything.\"</p><p>Swap religious dogma for a liberal dose of love, compassion and common sense and the world would be a better place. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joy Nason, Mona Vale</emphasis></p><p>Rules of engagement</p><p>Your correspondent opines that the UK will be more likely to join a coalition involving Australia in a war against Iran because Boris Johnson is now PM (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/time-to-stop-crown-from-further-blighting-cityscape-20190729-p52bs5.html\">Letters</url>, July 31) .</p><p>Fortunately for the British, their parliament retains the exclusive right to authorise the UK going to war.</p><p>Despite many in this country calling for our federal parliament to have the same rights, declarations of war by Australia may only be issued by the government of the day.</p><p>I expect a great many citizens, as we saw during the protests against Australia's involvement in the disastrous invasion of Iraq authorised by the Howard government, are not in favour of perpetuating the mistakes of joining coalitions in foreign wars.</p><p>Australia adopting a neutral self-defence posture is an option little considered, as is the proposition that our elected representatives should hold at least a veto over Australia going to war.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Sargent, Castle Hill </emphasis></p><p>At last, some good news</p><p>On a daily basis we read about multiple failures of our governments, so how good is it that Peter Hartcher is able to write an article about some successes we have achieved in the areas of social media, tax avoidance and the market dominance of Big Tech companies (\"Day of reckoning upon Big Tech\", July 30).</p><p>The achievements of the departments involved are recognised by government and encouraged to continue in their pursuits of providing appropriate regulation, while allowing innovation to flourish. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Nash, Fairlight </emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PM's priorities</emphasis></p><p>Scott Morrison says that the Newstart allowance doesn't need to be increased because it's better to provide jobs for the unemployed than to provide social welfare (\"Low-skilled migrants and lax employer laws 'driving down wages\"', July 30).</p><p>But at the same time his government has sat for their six-plus years watching as hundreds of thousands of Australians and migrant workers have been underpaid, ripped off and threatened by unscrupulous employers.</p><p>So much for his election claims that his Coalition, not Labor, looks after average Australians and migrant workers on visas or here illegally. And so much for their belief in trickle-down economics that has only seen stagnant wages as a torrent of riches trickles up to the wealthy of Australia. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kevin Farrell, Beelbangera </emphasis></p><p>Scrimping hints for Barnaby</p><p>Here is a to-do list for Barnaby Joyce, now that he can empathise with those who are less fortunate owing to his dire financial circumstances (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/time-to-stop-crown-from-further-blighting-cityscape-20190729-p52bs5.html\">Letters</url>, July 30).</p><p>Shopping; buy anything on special. Clothing will need to be bought at St Vinnies, Salvos or Lifeline. Eating out will be confined to Maccas, and then if there is a little money left over, he can go to the local RSL and play the pokies in the hope that he might get a win and pay for a few bills. - <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Janice Hull, Hat Head</emphasis></p><p>New funding needed for recycling</p><p>Your correspondent makes a good point about the need to use alternative materials to make power poles (Letters, July 30).

At Moral Money we are very excited about what this will bring. When we launched this newsletter six months ago we were unsure whether Financial Times readers had an appetite for environmental, social and governance investing. Now we know the answer is a resounding \u201cyes!\u201d. Our readership has soared and our \u201copen rate\u201d for the newsletter has been through the roof.\u00a0</p><p>So\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009thank you to all our readers. Do let us know what you do \u2014 or don\u2019t \u2014 like, since we learn a lot from your feedback. In fact, when we asked you what we should be following in the coming year we received so many brilliant tips that they inspired us to compile this list of \u201c20 things to watch in 2020\u201d. If they play out, 2020 will be the biggest year yet for ESG.</p><p>We have also encountered some criticism, not least about our name, which some readers find too pious. As we said when we launched, we chose \u201cMoral Money\u201d because it is catchy and free of the acronyms which haunt the worlds of sustainable business and investment. But we are not here to preach: we are journalists, not activists, and our aim is to illuminate, not advocate. We will celebrate progress and innovation in ESG, but we will also expose controversies and hypocrisy.</p><p>So Happy New Year \u2014 wherever you stand on the ESG curve. Please keep reading. And get ready for a busy year. Like many lists being drawn up at this time of year, this one is full of good intentions. We will be keeping track of which of these resolutions turn into real change \u2014 and which are quietly forgotten before the new year gets old.</p><p>1. Can anybody create unified ESG standards?\u00a0</p><p>Green finance cannot work without consistent accounting and auditing. But, as outgoing Bank of England governor\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Carney</emphasis>\u00a0(pictured below)\u00a0 has warned, companies have not been reporting \u201cin any consistent way\u201d on how they are managing their transition to the more volatile climate future.\u00a0</p><p>Mr Carney and his pal\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Bloomberg</emphasis> co-founded the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, or TCFD, to address this, but adoption of the voluntary disclosure project remains patchy. Europe made history in December by agreeing to a labelling system for sustainable finance, but its taxonomy will not jump the Atlantic in 2020: although the US Securities and Exchange Commission started scrutinising funds\u2019 ESG policies in 2019, it seems reluctant to embrace standardisation.\u00a0</p><p>So all eyes will be on America\u2019s private sector. The SEC decided in December to permit a shareholder proposal in 2020 that calls for Sustainability Accounting Standards Board disclosure, which shows how investor demands for ESG uniformity are swelling. Expect some interesting action soon from big accounting firms and banks.</p><p>2. The \u2018decade of delivery\u2019 has dawned</p><p>The year 2020 is the start of the UN\u2019s self-styled \u201cdecade of delivery\u201d, when the world is supposed to hit its sustainable development goals. Sadly, progress is patchy, but the zeitgeist is shifting. In 2019 CEOs who once shunned the UN were beating a path to its door, signing up for responsible finance, sustainable business and SDG-based pledges. One question in 2020 is how much tangible action this delivers. Another is whether the UN finds ways to mobilise private capital to plug the $3tn-a-year funding gap, by enlisting private investors or through better use of blended or \u201ccatalytic\u201d capital. This is the concept of using public money or philanthropic funds to guarantee (or \u201cwrap\u201d) risky projects in a manner that attracts more private funding. This concept has been used in a modest way for a long time but 2020 might be the year it really takes off.</p><p>3. The US election</p><p>America\u2019s Business Roundtable made a headline-grabbing attempt to champion reform \u2014 and fend off critics \u2014 in 2019 by issuing its new\u00a0 declaration of purpose. But who gets the US Democratic party\u2019s nomination in 2020 will determine the extent to which America\u2019s current model of corporate capitalism dominates the election campaign.\u00a0</p><p>The Roundtable\u2019s statement did not placate leftwing Democrats such as\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elizabeth Warren</emphasis> and\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bernie Sanders</emphasis>, who called for more radical changes such as big pay rises for workers. This criticism of the C-suite could swell if a left-of-centre candidate gains more traction \u2014 and that will place pressure on Roundtable members such as\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/blackrock-business-roundtable-statement-purpose\"> BlackRock</url> to back up their words with real change.\u00a0</p><p>4. The year of \u2018going olive\u2019\u00a0</p><p>Bankers like to say that 2020 will be the \u201cyear of green\u201d (finance). But it might be the year of \u201colive\u201d: one big recent shift is that financiers are no longer working just with crude distinctions between \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cbrown\u201d bonds and loans, but looking at the direction of travel from brown to green.\u00a0</p><p>More specifically, there is a new fad for creating instruments which reward companies that improve their sustainability metrics \u2014 even if they are not truly \u201cgreen\u201d yet. Enel helped to\u00a0 launch the trend in 2019; in 2020 numerous other companies will follow.</p><p>5. Endowments in the crosshairs</p><p>Fossil fuel divestment campaigns heated up in 2019 \u2014 and will get hotter in 2020, especially at university endowments. Last summer\u2019s youth-led climate protests have moved on to campuses, where activists are adopting new tactics to push university endowments to go fossil-free.\u00a0</p><p>Harvard is a case in point. Student and alumni divestment campaigners made headlines when they stormed the field during the school\u2019s football game against Yale in November. In 2020 their efforts will go\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fundfire.com/c/2606493/313013\"> far beyond</url> civil disobedience: divestment activists are running for seats on the university\u2019s board of overseers and roping in some big-name alumni in their fight, including a former senator and SEC commissioner, as reported by\u00a0FundFire. Harvard\u2019s faculty will soon vote on a divestment motion similar to one passed by the University of California. If the activists\u2019 efforts work, expect copycat measures at other colleges across the US.</p><p>6. How far will banks\u2019 fossil fuel aversion go?</p><p>Goldman Sachs won applause from environmental advocacy groups in December for\u00a0 announcing that it had stopped financing new coal power plants unless they have carbon emissions reduction technology.\u00a0</p><p>The same month, Standard Chartered pledged to reduce its exposure to coal clients by 2030 and Credit Suisse said it would stop financing new coal power plants. But concerns about global warming did not stop Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and two dozen other banks from underwriting Saudi Aramco\u2019s\u00a0 massive initial public offering. In 2020, will banks\u2019 commitments to fight global warming go only as far as their shareholders will allow?\u00a0</p><p>7. The year the PRI gets serious?</p><p>The UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investing has faced criticism for being too lax. This could change in 2020. This June the PRI is set to start kicking out signatories which do not meet certain sustainable investment standards. This is unlikely to silence critics, since the minimum requirements are \u2014 by the PRI\u2019s own admission \u2014 easy to achieve. But it is a step in the right direction, and only the beginning, according to chief executive\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fiona Reynolds</emphasis>.\u00a0</p><p>By making the PRI requirements easy to achieve in the beginning, the group has signed up more than 2,000 investors and become a sort of de facto standard in the investment management industry. Now, if asset managers back out of their pledges, they run the risk of losing business from sustainability-minded clients. That should let the PRI ratchet up the standards without fear of losing signatories; it will be interesting to see how quickly it moves to do so.\u00a0</p><p>8. Banks battle on ESG to attract rich millennials</p><p>In its investor day presentation in December, Credit Suisse announced an impact investing workshop series focusing on maximising impact and building sustainable portfolios. The primary target is next-generation private clients, aka trust fund kids. It is not alone: there is now a battle among banks to win and retain wealthy millennials. This demographic is not only overtaking baby boomers as the largest population segment but cares more than older groups about sustainable investing. Banks are scrambling to serve their needs \u2014 mindful that if they fail to do so, millennials will take their savings to a greener competitor.\u00a0</p><p>In December\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Liesel Pritzker Simmons</emphasis>, an heir to the wealthy Pritzker family (pictured below), said family offices are banding together to pressure banks to stop banking coal deals.</p><p>Sustainable investing is not just for the young or mega-rich, though. In 2020 we should see some big, celebrity-backed campaigns that aim to push the wider public\u2019s savings and pensions into sustainable financial products. London, the cradle of Live-Aid, looks set to take the lead.\u00a0</p><p>9. Will the UK lead the world in green initiatives?\u00a0</p><p>Brexit dominated UK headlines in 2019, unleashing poisonous gridlock and polarisation. However, there is one point on which almost all the UK\u2019s political parties now agree: the need to endorse green initiatives and more sustainable business. This will be on display when the UK hosts the next round of climate negotiations in Glasgow later this year.\u00a0</p><p>But in late 2019 UK regulators announced new rules that will force banks to comply with green disclosures, and the government is supposed to accelerate efforts to reach net zero targets in 2020. Public-private entities such as the Green Finance Institute in the City of London are accelerating this drive. All eyes are now on whether Britain continue to engage with EU climate initiatives after Brexit \u2014 and whether\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boris Johnson</emphasis>\u2019s green pledges live up to the hype.</p><p>10. Tokyo Olympics: a green festival or PR disaster?</p><p>Japan will also be vying for green plaudits in 2020, especially when Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games from late July to early August. The country has enthusiastically embraced the UN\u2019s SDG symbols \u2014 and goals \u2014 and the Abe administration hopes to use the Games to showcase its sustainability leadership.\u00a0</p><p>But the Olympics could inadvertently offer fresh reminders of why urgent action is needed on climate change: Tokyo was plagued by such horrifying displays of unusually extreme summer heat in recent years that the International Olympic Committee decided to move the marathon to Sapporo. That was a major blow to the capital city. Worse still, a US Olympics team coach told the Associated Press in December that back-up plans are needed for the outdoor swimming competitions if Tokyo\u2019s Odaiba Marine Park gets too hot.\u00a0</p><p>11. China the ESG leader?</p><p>China is another country to watch in 2020. The country used to be an ESG laggard but in December, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange announced new ESG disclosure requirements for its listed companies beginning in 2020 and the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are expected to follow Hong Kong\u2019s lead this year.\u00a0</p><p>China is already a world leader in green bond issuance. Many western banks say its bond disclosures fail to explain how proceeds will be used for eco-friendly purposes. But pressure is rising for better disclosure since in 2020, China will simultaneously be looking to increase foreign investments and cut pollution \u2014 and deep-pocketed European pension funds will demand action before they invest.</p><p>12. Will we ever see a global carbon market?</p><p>The international climate negotiators who\u00a0 failed to hammer out an international carbon pricing regime in Madrid in December will get another chance at COP 26 in Glasgow this year. But there are still major stumbling blocks that could threaten the efforts to implement an international pricing scheme as outlined in the Paris accord.\u00a0</p><p>One issue is what will happen to countries\u2019 old credits earned under the Kyoto protocol\u2019s \u201cClean Development Mechanism\u201d? Environmentalists hope these become redundant, as the CDM system has been\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/ets/docs/clean_dev_mechanism_en.pdf\"> criticised</url> for \u201cnot providing real, measurable and additional emission reductions\u201d. But the countries in possession of those credits are loath to give them up for free.</p><p>It is true that even while the UN spins its wheels, individual governments are not sitting idle. Many jurisdictions, including the entire EU and several US states, have implemented their own carbon pricing systems, and China is set to launch a carbon market this year. But there is a lot riding on the UN\u2019s plans \u2014 as the FT\u2019s\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Martin Wolf</emphasis>\u00a0 has warned: \u201cClimate change will not be solved by one country. To succeed, policy must be effective, legitimate and global.\u201d\u00a0</p><p/><p>13. A spotlight on biodiversity</p><p>This year, expect to hear a lot more about the importance of biodiversity and what the financial community can do to stop humans from wiping other species off the map. The UN has highlighted the issue in two of its SDGs (#14 \u2014 life below water and #15 \u2014 life on land) and has scheduled a biodiversity summit in China in late 2020.\u00a0</p><p>The issue is closely linked to climate change and could have similarly deleterious effects on humanity, but as of yet it has not often been highlighted as a material threat to companies and investors. That could soon change as investors start to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://realassets.axa-im.com/content/-/asset_publisher/x7LvZDsY05WX/content/biodiversity-crisis-the-role-of-investors-in-resolving-species-extinction-part-1/23818\"> factor in the risk</url> posed to companies that depend on biodiversity \u2014 in areas such as food, materials or medicines \u2014 and the possible threat of regulation that could penalise companies that contribute to extinction.</p><p>14. What about workers? The message from France\u2019s \u2018gilets jaunes\u2019</p><p>France\u2019s\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">gilets jaunes</emphasis> protests exploded in 2019, eventually forcing President\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emmanuel Macron</emphasis> to jettison fuel taxes which had been designed to drive down emissions. In 2020, however, Mr Macron will not be the only leader worrying about how to square climate change policies with political concerns about inequality and workers\u2019 pain.\u00a0</p><p>In America, for example, the Democrats face a nasty dilemma about how to advance their Green New Deal plans without alienating voters who work in industries which might collapse under these plans. Similar concerns stalk much of continental Europe. Thankfully, some policy ideas are being advanced: former Unilever chief executive\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Polman</emphasis>\u00a0(pictured below)\u00a0is calling for a \u201cjust transition\u201d that promotes inclusive growth for workers alongside environmental protection; Judge\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Leo Strine\u00a0</emphasis>told Moral Money that Democrats should focus on adding an extra \u201cE\u201d to ESG that stands for \u201cemployees\u201d. The problem for politicians in 2020 is how to turn this rhetoric into reality.\u00a0</p><p>15. Adaptation advantage</p><p>The main mantra of climate reform in the financial sector in 2019 was how to slow global warming. Expect to see a new emphasis in 2020 on \u201cadaptation\u201d, or a recognition that the effects of global warming are already here, and the finance sector must now help borrowers or companies adjust.\u00a0</p><p>Credit rating agencies have been leading this charge and downgrading borrowers whose ability to repay their debts is likely to be affected by ESG issues, but it is still early days. When investors start looking closely at how certain properties or companies are (or are not) prepared for the climate-related risks that are already visible, it could mean a massive shift in how these assets are valued. Brace yourself to see some scary projected losses soon.</p><p>16. Ignore the $100tn bond market at your peril</p><p>With their insatiable appetite for green bonds, debt investors are no strangers to the ESG world. However, they are often overlooked compared to the equity investors publicly pushing companies to clean up their acts. This is understandable to some degree \u2014\u00a0bond owners do not have proxy voting rights. But that does not mean they cannot still throw their considerable weight around.\u00a0</p><p>There has been an incremental rise in attention to ESG by bondholders. Last summer\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hiro Mizuno</emphasis>, chief investment officer of Japan\u2019s $1.6tn Government Pension Investment Fund, called on lenders and bondholders to do more to engage with companies on ESG. And Pimco, one of the world\u2019s biggest bond investors, launched in December its first fund dedicated to combating climate change. In addition to green bonds, the fund will seek out companies that demonstrate \u201cinnovative approaches to environmental sustainability\u201d. With the massive sums of money involved in the bond market, this kind of action might start a snowball effect in 2020.\u00a0</p><p>17. Big Tech\u2019s role in the clean energy transition</p><p>If the world is going to transition to a carbon-free economy, we have to change our energy consumption habits. But that does not just mean switching off the lights: 2020 could be the year we start a debate about using artificial intelligence and smart home technology to help people optimise the deployment of renewable energy.</p><p>This is badly needed. One problem with renewable energy is that it is generated intermittently \u2014 when it\u2019s sunny or windy \u2014 and cannot be easily stored. Worse still, energy consumption takes place (and is priced) with no connection to supply. In theory, AI should be able to synch things up so that more power is used at the same time that renewable energy is being generated, and maybe even priced to match supply and demand.\u00a0</p><p>Introducing these reforms might be controversial, given rising concern about privacy and monopoly power among tech giants such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple. (Can tech companies be trusted with the data? How do we ensure that they are incentivised on energy management rather than advertising, addiction and product placement?) But as pressure grows to deploy renewable energy sources, this debate will become more important.</p><p>18. California tests companies\u2019 stance on workers rights and consumer privacy</p><p>Californian businesses in 2020 will get in-your-face alignment with UN SDG #8, which pledges \u201cdecent work for all\u201d. On New Year\u2019s Day a\u00a0 new law went into effect that makes it much harder for companies to classify workers as independent contractors versus employees who are entitled to minimum wages, overtime and other benefits. Uber and Postmates have sued the US state to stop the law, known as Assembly Bill 5.</p><p>California\u2019s tough\u00a0 consumer privacy law also goes into effect on January 1. The law requires companies to tell customers what personal information they have collected and allows consumers to request that this information be deleted. Big tech companies from Amazon to ZipRecruiter will continue lobbying in 2020 to weaken the law.</p><p>19. Beyond Beyond Meat</p><p>The terrifying images of the burning Amazon forests in 2019 marked another setback in the battle to slow global warming and insatiable demand for beef was blamed as a root cause of the fires. But the meat industry also offered a source of hope for sustainability. The number of retail outlets selling Beyond Meat burgers increased to 20,000 in June 2019 from 5,000 in December 2017, according to Morgan Stanley. The company\u2019s revenues more than tripled to $107m earlier this year as its stock price soared.\u00a0</p><p>Competitors are racing to get alternative protein products on to diners\u2019 plates. In 2019 Nestl\u00e9 debuted a yellow pea protein burger, Hormel Foods unveiled its \u201cHappy Little Plants\u201d brand and Tyson Foods announced pea protein isolate nuggets. As alternative proteins become ubiquitous, 2020 should be the year diners can casually pair combating climate change with tasty meals.</p><p>20. Do Republicans shift their position on climate change?\u00a0</p><p>In 2019\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Trump</emphasis>\u2019s administration made most environmental groups despair: the president formally began withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, and moved to unwind many of the environmental protections his predecessor Barack Obama had introduced. However, one intriguing question for 2020 is whether Mr Trump might soften his stance.\u00a0</p><p>There is little sign of this in Washington but the Republican party is already\u00a0 splitting in the flood-prone swing state of Florida and we have seen growing signs of activists encouraging companies to use their lobbying dollars to push politicians in greener directions. Don\u2019t expect Mr Trump to rush back into the Paris agreement, but some of his party\u2019s congressmen may bend if their donors encourage them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-d52684e02c0911eabc7765e4aa615551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWJ-2H81-DXP9-90NH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3351\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS521110 MONETARY AUTHORITIES - CENTRAL BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>SIC6011 FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Accounting Requirements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDRGNDBDMDMzMTQwNDQwMDgxQTFDODAyRjVDNEQwMjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Forty-one percent remain undecided, while the remaining 28% are either unlikely to or will not make a change.</p><p>\u201cNo brand wants to be associated with hate speech, and as the effective funders of the social platform ecosystem, advertisers have a voice that needs to be heard,\u201d said Stephan Loerke, CEO of the WFA. \u201cWe are willing to work with the platforms on improvements that will benefit society, advertisers and the platforms themselves. This needs to be addressed fast because hate speech has moved from a reactive media management challenge into a boardroom issue for many companies.\u201d</p><p>The U.K.\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is proposing a new \u201cpro-competition regulatory regime\u201d to correct the actions of ad-supported platforms, especially Facebook and Google, which together control around 80% of the country\u2019s digital ad market.</p><p>The CMA is proposing to establish a Digital Markets Unit that, in part, would \u201cenforce a code of conduct to ensure that platforms with a position of market power, like Google and Facebook, do not engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices, or practices likely to reduce trust and transparency, and to impose fines if necessary.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThrough our examination of this market, we have discovered how major online platforms like Google and Facebook operate and how they use digital advertising to fuel their business models. What we have found is concerning\u2014if the market power of these firms goes unchecked, people and businesses will lose out,\u201d said CMA CEO Andrea Coscelli.</p><p>The CMA, in partnership with the U.K.\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office and telecom regulator Ofcom, also announced the formation of the Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum, which will regulate online services and how they use consumer data.</p><p>The CMA said that because Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation is still in its infancy, there is concern that big platforms could be interpreting the law in a way that favors their business models, rather than consumer control of their personal data.</p><p>\u201cPeople will carry on handing over more of their personal data than necessary, a lack of competition could mean higher prices for goods and services bought online, and we could all miss out on the benefits of the next innovative digital platform,\u201d Coscelli said.</p><p>The calls for advertisers to boycott platforms, specifically Facebook, started in late May following the wave of social protest sparked by the killing of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.</p><p>Advocacy groups emerged online calling for boycotts, claiming Facebook yet again incited violence on its platform after refusing to restrict or otherwise censure President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d post threatening violence against protesters.</p><p>According to the WFA\u2019s survey, 13% of respondents are taking actions besides pulling spend from platforms, including making \u201cpositive investments\u201d in minority-owned and focused titles.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1173954</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6087-T6J1-DYRK-H4FK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Not only is Singapore in the same time zone as China, it also has a workforce that can speak mandarin as well as great political stability and transparency which gives businesses peace of mind,\" said Joel Shen, a tech lawyer who advises tech companies on market entry.</p><p>Increasing pressure on Chinese tech has led these firms to look for ways to ring fence their operations to serve the lucrative US market, and experts say Singapore could be the next best option. Many Chinese tech firms have already set up shop in the city-state known for its business-friendly regulations, intellectual property protection and available talent.</p><p>ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, recently shifted its regional headquarters in Singapore to One Raffles Quay, with word on the street estimating that the company is set to lease up to 60,000 sq ft, or two floors, in the prime location.</p><p>The firm is also actively hiring for many positions here, including roles in product management, software engineering, data and risk analysis, and monetisation strategies.</p><p>Leading Chinese artificial intelligence firm SenseTime in 2019 said it plans to triple its staff in Singapore within three years to about 300 people, while e-commerce giant Alibaba just this year acquired a 50 per cent stake in 50-storey prime office tower AXA in Singapore.</p><p>However, observers suggest that splitting up units of global tech operations may not change much for Chinese tech firms, since US President Trump's latest executive order is seen to be more of a political play rather than for national security issues.</p><p>Mr Trump on Thursday issued two executive orders to ban popular Chinese social media apps TikTok and WeChat in 45 days, citing possible threats to economic and national security.</p><p>US companies would no longer be able to work with WeChat, the messaging platform owned by Tencent, and ByteDance after the grace period.</p><p>The order essentially sets a 45-day deadline for an acquisition of TikTok, which is in talks to be acquired by Microsoft.</p><p>The clampdown on the apps has been regarded as yet another stroke in Trump's increasingly broad campaign against China.</p><p>On Thursday, the Trump administration also issued recommendations for the delisting of Chinese companies that do not comply with US accounting standards on American stock exchanges.</p><p>Such moves add to the growing concerns of Chinese tech firms and their investors, as they rush to review their exposure to potential US policy actions.</p><p>The Trump administration's decisions naturally saw a pushback from Chinese companies.</p><p>TikTok said in a statement on Friday that the executive order \"risks undermining global businesses' trust in the US' commitment to the rule of law, which has served as a magnet for investment and spurred decades of American economic growth\".</p><p>It added that the company was \"shocked\" by the recent order, which was issued \"without any due process\".</p><p>\"This sets a dangerous precedent for the concept of free expression and open markets. We will pursue all remedies available to us in order to ensure that the rule of law is not discarded and that our company and our users are treated fairly - if not by the Administration, then by the US courts,\" said TikTok.</p><p>According to reports from Bloomberg, American user data for TikTok is stored in servers in the US and Singapore, not China. But TikTok's terms of service stipulate that the company may share information with its parent, subsidiary or other affiliates.</p><p>Previous versions of its privacy policy warned users it could exchange information with its Chinese businesses, law enforcement agencies and public authorities, if legally required to do so.</p><p>Rising tensions between the US and Chinese Big Tech are likely to have ripple effects on international markets and investors, said Li Jianggan.</p><p>\"Investors need assurance in order to act, and Trump's drastic moves to exclude Chinese-backed firms from the US markets might dent investors' confidence in the international markets, leading to fewer opportunities for Singapore too.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore may be an intuitive alternative for Chinese companies to park their ex-China operations as the US clamps down on Chinese tech.

In it, the authors set about showing how groundbreaking research into decision-making by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky decades earlier (for which Kahneman later won a Nobel prize) could be applied to public policy. The point of the book,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/nudge-2.html\">as one psychologist puts it</url>, is that \"people are often not the best judges of what will serve their interests, and that institutions, including government, can help people do better for themselves (and the rest of us) with small changes - nudges - in the structure of the choices people face\".</p><p>                     Nudge proved very popular with policymakers because it suggested a strategy for encouraging citizens to make intelligent choices without overtly telling them what to do. Thaler and Sunstein argued that if people are left to their own devices they often make unwise choices and that these mistakes can be mitigated if governments or organisations take an active role in framing those choices. A classic example is trying to ensure that employees have a pension plan. Their employer can encourage them to choose a plan by emphasising the importance of having one. Or they can frame the decision by having every employee enrolled in the company plan by default, with the option of opting out and choosing their own scheme.</p><p>Thaler and Sunstein describe their philosophy as \"libertarian paternalism\". What it involves is a design approach known as \"choice architecture\" and in particular controlling the default settings at any point where a person has to make a decision.</p><p>Funnily enough, this is something that the tech industry has known for decades. In the mid-1990s, for example, Microsoft - which had belatedly realised the significance of the web - set out to destroy Netscape, the first company to create a proper web browser. Microsoft did this by installing its own browser - Internet Explorer - on every copy of the Windows operating system. Users were free to install Netscape, of course, but Microsoft relied on the fact that very few people ever change default settings. For this abuse of its monopoly power, Microsoft was landed with an antitrust suit that nearly resulted in its breakup. But it did succeed in destroying Netscape.</p><p>When the EU introduced its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/nudge-2.html\">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</url> - which seeks to give internet users significant control over uses of their personal data - many of us wondered how data-vampires like Google and Facebook would deal with the implicit threat to their core businesses. Now that the regulation is in force, we're beginning to find out: they're using choice architecture to make it as difficult as possible for users to do what is best for them while making it easy to do what is good for the companies.</p><p>We know this courtesy of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/nudge-2.html\">a very useful 43-page report</url> just out from the Norwegian Consumer Council, an organisation funded by the Norwegian government. The researchers examined recent - GDPR-inspired - updates to user settings by Google, Facebook and Windows 10. What they found was that default settings and \"dark patterns\" (techniques and features of interface design meant to manipulate users) are being deployed to nudge users towards privacy-intrusive options. The findings include \"privacy-intrusive default settings, misleading wording, giving users an illusion of control, hiding away privacy-friendly choices, take-it-or-leave-it choices, and choice architectures where choosing the privacy-friendly option requires more effort for the users\".</p><p>The researchers found that both Facebook and Google in particular have privacy-intrusive defaults - \"where users who want the privacy friendly option have to go through a significantly longer process. They even obscure some of these settings so that the user cannot know that the more privacy-intrusive option was preselected.\"</p><p>Popup alerts from Facebook, Google and Windows 10 turn out to have design, symbols and wording that nudge users away from the privacy-friendly choices. Choices are worded \"to compel users to make certain choices, while key information is omitted or downplayed. None of them lets the user freely postpone decisions. Also, Facebook and Google threaten users with loss of functionality or deletion of the user account if the user does not choose the privacy-intrusive option\".</p><p>I could go on, but you will get the point. Thaler and Sunstein might be impressed by the architecture of these choices were it not for the fact that they are designed to make perverse rather than socially responsible outcomes more likely. At the root of it all, of course, is the warped business model of surveillance capitalism. So to expect the companies to behave differently would be about as realistic as expecting Dracula to request that his\u00a0guests sign a consent form before sitting down to dinner.</p><p>                   What I'm reading                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.guardianbookshop.com/nudge-2.html\">'I was devastated'</url>                     The inventor of the web, Tim Berners-Lee, is dismayed at how his creation has been warped by corporations and ideologies - and is trying to fix it.

For Colorado, this was the latest round of FB bucks to drop. In April, this newsletterreported[2] how eight Colorado newsrooms pulled in money linked to the social network run by Mark Zuckerberg, who, Forbesreported,[3]has an estimated net worth of more than $60 billion. Here are the latest Colorado outlets and how much they, or their companies, received in this latest round of funding:The Denver Post(Media News Group): $150,000 Animas Del Oeste, LLC /World Journal[4]inWalsenburg: $100,000 Colorado Public Radio: $50,000 The Colorado Sun: $40,000 High Country Newsin Paonia:$39,450 Left Hand Valley Publishing, LLC /The Left Hand Valley Courier[5]in Niwot: $25,000Again, these are just the latest grants, made as part of a COVID-19 relief effort. </p><p>The Sun, for instance, earlier received $60,000 from Facebook. The Colorado Independent received $5,000 linked to Facebook in April. Nationally, the pool of COVID-19 Local News Relief Fund Grant Program recipients 'is notable in that nearly four in five are family or independently owned, half are published by or for communities of color, nearly 40 percent are digitally native publishers, and just over a third are non-profits,' the Facebook Journalism Projectstated[6]. Moreabout how the organizations werechosen[7]:These grant recipients were selected through a process [led] by theLocal Media Association[8](LMA) andThe Lenfest Institute for Journalism[9]and with significant contributions from theInstitute for Nonprofit News[10](INN),Local Independent Online News Publishers[11](LION),Local Media Consortium[12](LMC), and theNational Association of Broadcasters[13](NAB). Past Accelerator participants from the US and Canada are also receiving relief grants to help safeguard the transformation they've achieved over the last several years and to capitalize on new opportunities. Remaining funds will be used throughout 2020 to support projects focused on longer-term sustainability in local journalism.In recent years, Big Tech platformshave siphoned advertising dollars away from news outlets nationwide. Facebook and Google particularly 'have used monopoly to rob journalism of its revenue,'argued[14]formerUSA TodayeditorJoanne Lipman[15]last year. Both mega-companies also have created programs to kick some of that cash back into the local news scene, which in turn thanks them for it. In Colorado, beyond these multiple Facebook grants, Google isfunding a newsroom experiment[16]in Longmont. Is this altruism[17], being a good corporate citizen, or a realization that both large companies need a healthy local news ecosystem to support their bottom lines and also maybe hold regulators at bay as the platforms struggle to limit their roles in the spread of dangerous misinformation online? Regardless of why, is what they're doing enough? Also: Might it keep some outlets from scrutinizing their behavior? Some news organizations seemloath to take government money[18]for a variety of reasons, but what about money from powerfulso-calledNet states[19]or 'digital non-state actors' some liken to 'the equivalent to global superpowers'? All questions to keep in mind as local news organizations scramble to plug holes in a bottomed-out business model that late-capitalism wrought well before the brutal impacts of this current pandemic. Then again:What are you supposed to say whenthe editor at a small local newspaper tells you, like one did this week, how a Facebook grantlikely kept it from closing? ('Glad to hear it,' was my answer.) Upon news thatThe Denver Post earned one of these grants, somereaders immediately wondered whether the money would go toward producing more local journalism or be hooveredup by the newspaper's hedge-fund owner. A very fair question. And the answer to the latter is no, says Daniel Petty, digital director of audience development for Media News Group, which includes thePost.'It has to be spent on reporting and journalism,' he says. That could also mean commissioning freelancers, paying for open records requests for newsgathering, and supporting internships, for instance. About that $150,000 number, though. It might sound big for a single newsroom like thePostbut the money will also go tootherMNG papers, too, and doesn't have to stay in Colorado. 'It's being spread around the company,' Petty says. The paper is grateful for the new money (the third grant Facebook has made toThe Denver Post), he added, which has helped the paper better ramp up subscriptions. I pinged a couple of the smaller newsrooms to see what Facebook's cash meant for them. FromJocelyn Rowley,[20]editor ofThe Left Hand Valley Courier[21]: Our grant funds will be used to bolster our COVID19 coverage, subsidize advertising for struggling local businesses, and provide free subscriptions to elderly and low-income residents. In the coming weeks, we are hoping to add a part-time reporter, an educational outreach specialist, and a social media coordinator, and will begin working with small businesses in the area who want to advertise with us, but are experiencing a financial hardship. But, I don't want to overlook the fact that this grant in all likelihood saved the Left Hand Valley Courier. We are a very small newspaper in Niwot, with a small staff and limited resources, and were forced to cut our print edition when advertising revenue plummeted in March. In April, we transitioned to online subscriptions, and the funds provided by the Facebook Journalism Grant will help us continue to publish as we struggle back to profitability under this new scheme. As for another small news outlet,Brian Orr, co-publisher of theWorld Journal inWalsenburg, said, 'Real basically, we'll be using the Facebook grant to stay in business.' That paper hasn't laid anyone off, 'and now that threat is lifted,' he said. 'We paid our back printing bill, and will be able to sock away ad revenue coming in now for the next big slowdown in the fall.''I got laid off from Westword today' About two months ago, a newsroom labor union trying to organize its workersannounced[22]Westword'sparent company, Voice Media Group, was slashing pay. The employees also warned budget cuts could lead to layoffs. That happened at some ofWestword'ssister papers, and now the pandemic-induced contractions have come to Denver. On May 8, staff writer Chase Woodruffsaid[23], 'I got laid off from Westword today.' He called writing for an alt-weekly a dream job, and he carried out that dream in the true spirit of the unruly alts of yesteryear with aprofane smashmouth style and a social media presence that entertainingly eviscerated theday's buttoned-down political reportagefromD.C. to Denver. As someone whosaid[24] he planned to vote for Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, these days Woodruff lances the state's chief executive sometimes better than the governor's sharpest conservative critic. Woodruff used to have a pinned tweet that quoted Joseph Pulitzer's creed from 1907[25], and said about it,'One really striking thing about the National Conversation About Journalism we've had lately is how narrowly so many journalists want to define their role. It's all: we tell stories, we get the facts, we're defenders of truth. Imagine seeing this from a newspaper editor today.'Woodruff 'pushed Westword in the right direction,'said[26] the paper'sformer managing editor,Ana Campbell, who now runs Denverite.On his way out of the alt-weekly world, Woodruffurged[27]his readerstokeep supportingWestword'and any other outlet committed to independent, adversarial, occasionally rude and angry journalism. The world needs it.' Indeed it does.(HisWestwordarchive liveshere[28].) A few days after he was let go, Woodruff penned apowerful essay[29]on his personal websitetitled 'stay mad' that includes a searing media critique.From themanifesto[30]:It's obvious who profits from a news media that has grown increasingly sanitized, under-resourced and afraid to be seen as antagonistic or unruly. If you believe at all in the power of the press to make the world a better place, it comes as no surprise that its decline has corresponded with the rise of entire rotten generations of new or newly re-emboldened villains: megalomaniacal tech billionaires and unabashed white-nationalist demagogues, economy-crashing Wall Street robber barons and planet-burning climate deniers, an ever more cartoonish and more powerful tableau of ruthless plutocrats and conspiracist grifters and mercenary political operatives and, not least, the dodderingly despotic reality-television star currently presiding over it all.Personally, I think we might benefit from more writing like that around here\u2014 and hopefully someone might pay him to do it.How Week Nine of COVID coverage looked on Sunday's front pages across Colorado The Gazettein Colorado Springs reported onCDC data showing an undercount of deaths[31].The Loveland Reporter-Heraldreported the latest virus tally[32].The Longmont Times-Calltold readers howthe pandemic wasn't stopping Mothers' Day festivities in the area[33].The Greeley Tribunecovereda day in the life of eight local residents during the pandemic[34].The Grand Junction Daily Sentinelreported ona sputtering oil-and-gas industry on the Western Slope[35].The Coloradoanin Fort Collins reported onlocal restaurant anxiety amid some estimates that one in five of them could close[36].The Durango Heraldcovered re-opening efforts in the area[37].The Denver Postran a package under the headline 'Meat supply chain runs into problems[38].'The Boulder Daily Cameraput aDenver PostQ-and-Awith Gov. Jared Polis on the front page[39]. The governor lauded the local press. And then As Republican President Donald Trump continues hisanti-media schtick during press briefings and on social media, some governors have taken a different route. They've gone out of their way to praise the work of local news outlets during a scary and confusing time. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Poliscreated a video[40]in which he thanked 'our incredible journalists across the state for getting good information into the hands of our residents.' Local news outlets, he said, 'are working hard to put out facts, not fear, throughout the pandemic.' By working together 'and getting information to, reputable, professional news sources, I have no doubt that Colorado will emerge stronger than ever.' Some local journalists responded, but not in the way the governor might have expected. From Denver Post senior politics editor Cindi Andrews:I mean, if @GovofCO[41] wants to show his appreciation for the role of journalists, he can always support stronger state document retention policies and charge less for public information. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/KnmFquOqOJ\">https://t.co/KnmFquOqOJ</url>[42] \u2014 Cindi Andrews (@CindiinCO) May 12, 2020[43]'Thanking the press is great,' said[44]Chris Vanderveen of KUSA 9News.'Thinking of how your administration will handle records retention policies moving forward is even better. Committing to full transparency without asking the press to pay thousands of dollars for public records? Priceless.' Gazettereporter and editorTom Roeder[45]:This is a refreshing comment. But complimenting a journalist creates the same reaction as an insult: Increasing our suspicion. :)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/K03QjzljLj\">https://t.co/K03QjzljLj</url>[46] \u2014 Tom Roeder (@xroederx) May 12, 2020[47]AndChase Woodruff[48]formerly ofWestword: 'there are some white lies and rhetorical crutches I'm trying to be more tolerant of but sorry, the notion that we're going to come out of this 'stronger than ever' is delusional.' New site planstohawk-eye Denver Public Schools A new digital informationsite[49]'dedicated to community-based commentary and advocacy-focused coverage of Denver Public Schools' has hit the scene. Launched by longtime Denver journalistAlan Gottlieb[50]andfunded byRootEd[51],BoardHawk seeks to watchdog the new school board thathas[52]'three new members skeptical of the direction the district had taken under its two previous superintendents.'The site's fiscal sponsor is The Colorado League of Charter Schools. Here's what Gottlieb said about the site in an email he circulated recently:Some of you grizzled veterans might remember that before Chalkbeat existed, I launched EdNew Colorado in January 2008, with Todd Engdahl covering the General Assembly and me soliciting and writing commentaries on the education issues of the day. As I merged EdNews with Elizabeth Green's GothamSchools to form Chalkbeat, we decided that the edgy commentaries would distract from Chalkbeat's goal of becoming the most credible and neutral education news source possible. So we did away with that component of what had been EdNews. I've always missed the give and take the commentary section provoked, and I'm hoping to revive that here. This site in no way competes with Chalkbeat, which does a stellar job covering Colorado education. What I'm trying to do is provide the op-ed page for Denvereducation coverage which has been missing for several years. Gotliebcould have launched the site sooner, 'but the Covid-19 crisis delayed us as we waited for what seemed like an appropriate moment,' he said. 'Now, however, the school board is about to [swing] back into action, so the time seems right.'Check out this new sitehere[53] where it soundslike things could get spicy. Alt-weekly wags a finger at local dailies. Then Last week in this humble little newsletter about the news behind the news I had the embarrassingresponsibility ofmaking a correction[54]about a section of the newsletter that, ironically, had highlighted a local newspaper'sfront-page correction[55]that hadalsoneeded to be corrected.No journalist wants to issue corrections; they'd rather get it right the first time.But when they screw up, which is bound to happen sometimes, they're supposed to correct them \u2014 and swiftly.Also last week, Imade the case[56]for why we're likely to see more typos, errors of fact, and other 'howlers' in daily newsprint, leading to more corrections, as more and more editors who do the proofreading are getting laid off. Amy Gillentine Sweet, who publishes The Colorado Springs Independent,took a different tack, publishing acolumn[57]in the alt-weekly under the headline 'Media should do better in times of crisis \u2014 and always.' In it wasthis[58]:When the press gets it wrong, it's just another reason for naysayers to shout, 'fake news.' And while we don't always get it right, we should always immediately correct mistakes and make sure readers understand the facts. Hey, Gazette, I'm talking to you. And to The Pueblo Chieftain, you guys down south. Get it right. When you don't, admit it and fix it. Let your readers know there was a mistake. The truth is more important than your ego. Consider last week's headline in The Gazette, claiming that Leon Kelly of El Paso County Public Health said the county was ready to reopen. They quote Kelly: 'We could open businesses tomorrow \u2014 open them all \u2014 it does not matter if people are too scared to go to those restaurants, too afraid to go to those shops. Our job is to prove that we are ready. El Paso is ready to go.' However, The Gazette failed to report the rest of his statement. Kelly took to social media to correct the record \u2014 because The Gazette didn't.The alt-weekly column about owning up to errors, omissions, and mistakes was later updated at the end with this: 'Clarification: Regarding last week's publisher's note, according to Leon Kelly, the media outlet who cut off his remarks was KRDO. WhileThe Gazettealso claimed that Kelly wanted to completely re-open the economy in its original coverage, it has since updated the story to more accurately reflect Kelly's stance.' Elsewhere in thecolumn[59], Gillentine Sweet took on The Pueblo Chieftainfor thatmajor screw-up Iflagged[60]last week. Here's howshe handled it:imagine our surprise when the Chieftain printed an editorial allegedly penned by Colorado Publishing House employee and Southeast Express General Manager and Editor Regan Foster. While Regan formerly worked at the Chieftain, she didn't write the editorial, nor did she contribute to it. She hasn't been on staff there for more than 18 months. Oops. The Chieftain is owned by GateHouse Media, which says its centralized design team in Austin made the mistake. (We believe you should keep operations local and know your community \u2014 and maybe your staff too.)On social media,Chieftain sports reporter Austin J. White asked for a clarification from the paper.Can we get a clarification @csindependent[61]? This column sure makes it sounds like the Chieftain didn't run any kind of correction. The paper also is not owned by GateHouse anymore like the story states       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/2FigvsIVE3\">https://t.co/2FigvsIVE3</url>[62] \u2014 Austin J. White (@ajw_sports) May 13, 2020[63](That's how I read the column, too. The Chieftain'sacknowledgment of its mistake is onlinehere[64].) Gillentine Sweet told me she felt she 'did say they corrected it \u2014 by blaming it on their distant designer' so she doesn't think a clarification is needed. The following day, this separate clarification appeared in thecolumn[65]: 'Some people are pointing out that GateHouse no longer exists as GateHouse. In November 2019, New Media Investment Group, the successor to GateHouse Media, acquired newspaper publisher Gannett. The two companies merged and will operate under the Gannett brand. Subsidiary papers include Pueblo Events and The Pueblo West View.' Find more ofthe alt-weekly's local coveragehere[66]. Mike Littwin moves to The Colorado Sun\ufe0f'This is, sadly, my last column forThe Colorado Independent. But it's also, happily, my first column forThe Colorado Sun.' That was columnist Mike Littwin'snote to readerstoday[67], marking another chapter inthe Indy'songoingtransformation[68]. From his goodbye/hellocolumn[69]: I'm gone. I'm back. It's a weird world, but you already knew that. But first an explanation. I'm leaving The Indy's employ after seven years because my bosses, Susan Greene and Tina Griego, are going in what we call 'a different direction,' which is great for them, great for Colorado, great for journalism, but not so great for me. They are out to help save local journalism in Colorado (they'd never use the word 'save' \u2014 that's my take, which I'll explain in a bit). My mission \u2014 as I like to think of it \u2014 is not exactly to save the world, but to offer a twice-weekly alternative vision to the surreal one we're stuck with today.Now for the big question: Will his writing change? His answer:But fortunately for me in this new world, my new boss doesn't want me to change much at all. He wants me to write the column in much the same way I did it at The Indy, which is much the same way I did it at the Post, which is the much the same way I did it at the Rocky, which is much the same way I did it at the Baltimore Sun, which is much the same way I did it at the LA Times. I could go back even further (my first job was covering the Virginia Squires and Dr. J in the old ABA), but, for those keeping score, I've been at this for a long, long time \u2014 working, in various iterations, as a sports columnist, news columnist, features columnist, op-ed columnist, everything but a men's-fashion columnist.Littwinsays[70]a lot more about the new direction ofThe Colorado Independentand its editors, Susan Greene and Tina Griego, and so you should read it here. In their ownnewsletter[71]today, those editors added this: 'The Indy'sthoughtful statehouse reporter, John Herrick, and Forest Wilson, our former intern who has grown into quite the resourceful correspondent, will be ending their stints with us.' More from that note:When you come to our site this spring and summer, you'll find stories from us, from our partners such as Sandra Fish, who is helping journalists and the public root out viral misinformation, and Jeff Roberts, the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition's public-records and open-meetings watchdog. You'll find the early fruit of our reporting partnerships. We'll be highlighting journalism from the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, from valley to mountain and points in between. You'll still be able to read Corey Hutchins's media column as he tracks massive changes to Colorado's media world. And our guest posts aren't going anywhere, so please keep submitting.'Public relations spinmeisters might frame our new mission as innovative - the first alliance nationally between a nonprofit news team, a statewide press association and an organization dedicated to the understanding that local news is a public good,' the editors alsosay[72].'Those spinmeisters would not be entirely wrong. The mission is innovative. But it is also practical, a wiser, more strategic way to marshalthe strength of newsrooms across the state and to buttress the weaknesses. And it is also an experiment.' So there you have it. Another news experiment in test-tube Colorado. *This column appears a little differently as a published version of a weekly e-mailed newsletter about Colorado local news and media.

For Colorado, this was the latest round of FB bucks to drop. In April, this newsletterreported[2] how eight Colorado newsrooms pulled in money linked to the social network run by Mark Zuckerberg, who, Forbesreported,[3]has an estimated net worth of more than $60 billion. Here are the latest Colorado outlets and how much they, or their companies, received in this latest round of funding:The Denver Post(Media News Group): $150,000 Animas Del Oeste, LLC /World Journal[4]inWalsenburg: $100,000 Colorado Public Radio: $50,000 The Colorado Sun: $40,000 High Country Newsin Paonia:$39,450 Left Hand Valley Publishing, LLC /The Left Hand Valley Courier[5]in Niwot: $25,000Again, these are just the latest grants, made as part of a COVID-19 relief effort. </p><p>The Sun, for instance, earlier received $60,000 from Facebook. The Colorado Independent received $5,000 linked to Facebook in April. Nationally, the pool of COVID-19 Local News Relief Fund Grant Program recipients 'is notable in that nearly four in five are family or independently owned, half are published by or for communities of color, nearly 40 percent are digitally native publishers, and just over a third are non-profits,' the Facebook Journalism Projectstated[6]. Moreabout how the organizations werechosen[7]:These grant recipients were selected through a process [led] by theLocal Media Association[8](LMA) andThe Lenfest Institute for Journalism[9]and with significant contributions from theInstitute for Nonprofit News[10](INN),Local Independent Online News Publishers[11](LION),Local Media Consortium[12](LMC), and theNational Association of Broadcasters[13](NAB). Past Accelerator participants from the US and Canada are also receiving relief grants to help safeguard the transformation they've achieved over the last several years and to capitalize on new opportunities. Remaining funds will be used throughout 2020 to support projects focused on longer-term sustainability in local journalism.In recent years, Big Tech platformshave siphoned advertising dollars away from news outlets nationwide. Facebook and Google particularly 'have used monopoly to rob journalism of its revenue,'argued[14]formerUSA TodayeditorJoanne Lipman[15]last year. Both mega-companies also have created programs to kick some of that cash back into the local news scene, which in turn thanks them for it. In Colorado, beyond these multiple Facebook grants, Google isfunding a newsroom experiment[16]in Longmont. Is this altruism[17], being a good corporate citizen, or a realization that both large companies need a healthy local news ecosystem to support their bottom lines and also maybe hold regulators at bay as the platforms struggle to limit their roles in the spread of dangerous misinformation online? Regardless of why, is what they're doing enough? Also: Might it keep some outlets from scrutinizing their behavior? Some news organizations seemloath to take government money[18]for a variety of reasons, but what about money from powerfulso-calledNet states[19]or 'digital non-state actors' some liken to 'the equivalent to global superpowers'? All questions to keep in mind as local news organizations scramble to plug holes in a bottomed-out business model that late-capitalism wrought well before the brutal impacts of this current pandemic. Then again:What are you supposed to say whenthe editor at a small local newspaper tells you, like one did this week, how a Facebook grantlikely kept it from closing? ('Glad to hear it,' was my answer.) Upon news thatThe Denver Post earned one of these grants, somereaders immediately wondered whether the money would go toward producing more local journalism or be hooveredup by the newspaper's hedge-fund owner. A very fair question. And the answer to the latter is no, says Daniel Petty, digital director of audience development for Media News Group, which includes thePost.'It has to be spent on reporting and journalism,' he says. That could also mean commissioning freelancers, paying for open records requests for newsgathering, and supporting internships, for instance. About that $150,000 number, though. It might sound big for a single newsroom like thePostbut the money will also go tootherMNG papers, too, and doesn't have to stay in Colorado. 'It's being spread around the company,' Petty says. The paper is grateful for the new money (the third grant Facebook has made toThe Denver Post), he added, which has helped the paper better ramp up subscriptions. I pinged a couple of the smaller newsrooms to see what Facebook's cash meant for them. FromJocelyn Rowley,[20]editor ofThe Left Hand Valley Courier[21]: Our grant funds will be used to bolster our COVID19 coverage, subsidize advertising for struggling local businesses, and provide free subscriptions to elderly and low-income residents. In the coming weeks, we are hoping to add a part-time reporter, an educational outreach specialist, and a social media coordinator, and will begin working with small businesses in the area who want to advertise with us, but are experiencing a financial hardship. But, I don't want to overlook the fact that this grant in all likelihood saved the Left Hand Valley Courier. We are a very small newspaper in Niwot, with a small staff and limited resources, and were forced to cut our print edition when advertising revenue plummeted in March. In April, we transitioned to online subscriptions, and the funds provided by the Facebook Journalism Grant will help us continue to publish as we struggle back to profitability under this new scheme. As for another small news outlet,Brian Orr, co-publisher of theWorld Journal inWalsenburg, said, 'Real basically, we'll be using the Facebook grant to stay in business.' That paper hasn't laid anyone off, 'and now that threat is lifted,' he said. 'We paid our back printing bill, and will be able to sock away ad revenue coming in now for the next big slowdown in the fall.''I got laid off from Westword today' About two months ago, a newsroom labor union trying to organize its workersannounced[22]Westword'sparent company, Voice Media Group, was slashing pay. The employees also warned budget cuts could lead to layoffs. That happened at some ofWestword'ssister papers, and now the pandemic-induced contractions have come to Denver. On May 8, staff writer Chase Woodruffsaid[23], 'I got laid off from Westword today.' He called writing for an alt-weekly a dream job, and he carried out that dream in the true spirit of the unruly alts of yesteryear with aprofane smashmouth style and a social media presence that entertainingly eviscerated theday's buttoned-down political reportagefromD.C. to Denver. As someone whosaid[24] he planned to vote for Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, these days Woodruff lances the state's chief executive sometimes better than the governor's sharpest conservative critic. Woodruff used to have a pinned tweet that quoted Joseph Pulitzer's creed from 1907[25], and said about it,'One really striking thing about the National Conversation About Journalism we've had lately is how narrowly so many journalists want to define their role. It's all: we tell stories, we get the facts, we're defenders of truth. Imagine seeing this from a newspaper editor today.'Woodruff 'pushed Westword in the right direction,'said[26] the paper'sformer managing editor,Ana Campbell, who now runs Denverite.On his way out of the alt-weekly world, Woodruffurged[27]his readerstokeep supportingWestword'and any other outlet committed to independent, adversarial, occasionally rude and angry journalism. The world needs it.' Indeed it does.(HisWestwordarchive liveshere[28].) A few days after he was let go, Woodruff penned apowerful essay[29]on his personal websitetitled 'stay mad' that includes a searing media critique.From themanifesto[30]:It's obvious who profits from a news media that has grown increasingly sanitized, under-resourced and afraid to be seen as antagonistic or unruly. If you believe at all in the power of the press to make the world a better place, it comes as no surprise that its decline has corresponded with the rise of entire rotten generations of new or newly re-emboldened villains: megalomaniacal tech billionaires and unabashed white-nationalist demagogues, economy-crashing Wall Street robber barons and planet-burning climate deniers, an ever more cartoonish and more powerful tableau of ruthless plutocrats and conspiracist grifters and mercenary political operatives and, not least, the dodderingly despotic reality-television star currently presiding over it all.Personally, I think we might benefit from more writing like that around here  and hopefully someone might pay him to do it.How Week Nine of COVID coverage looked on Sunday's front pages across Colorado The Gazettein Colorado Springs reported onCDC data showing an undercount of deaths[31].The Loveland Reporter-Heraldreported the latest virus tally[32].The Longmont Times-Calltold readers howthe pandemic wasn't stopping Mothers' Day festivities in the area[33].The Greeley Tribunecovereda day in the life of eight local residents during the pandemic[34].The Grand Junction Daily Sentinelreported ona sputtering oil-and-gas industry on the Western Slope[35].The Coloradoanin Fort Collins reported onlocal restaurant anxiety amid some estimates that one in five of them could close[36].The Durango Heraldcovered re-opening efforts in the area[37].The Denver Postran a package under the headline 'Meat supply chain runs into problems[38].'The Boulder Daily Cameraput aDenver PostQ-and-Awith Gov. Jared Polis on the front page[39]. The governor lauded the local press. And then As Republican President Donald Trump continues hisanti-media schtick during press briefings and on social media, some governors have taken a different route. They've gone out of their way to praise the work of local news outlets during a scary and confusing time. Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Poliscreated a video[40]in which he thanked 'our incredible journalists across the state for getting good information into the hands of our residents.' Local news outlets, he said, 'are working hard to put out facts, not fear, throughout the pandemic.' By working together 'and getting information to, reputable, professional news sources, I have no doubt that Colorado will emerge stronger than ever.' Some local journalists responded, but not in the way the governor might have expected. From Denver Post senior politics editor Cindi Andrews:I mean, if @GovofCO[41] wants to show his appreciation for the role of journalists, he can always support stronger state document retention policies and charge less for public information. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/KnmFquOqOJ\">https://t.co/KnmFquOqOJ</url>[42]   Cindi Andrews (@CindiinCO) May 12, 2020[43]'Thanking the press is great,' said[44]Chris Vanderveen of KUSA 9News.'Thinking of how your administration will handle records retention policies moving forward is even better. Committing to full transparency without asking the press to pay thousands of dollars for public records? Priceless.' Gazettereporter and editorTom Roeder[45]:This is a refreshing comment. But complimenting a journalist creates the same reaction as an insult: Increasing our suspicion. :)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/K03QjzljLj\">https://t.co/K03QjzljLj</url>[46]   Tom Roeder (@xroederx) May 12, 2020[47]AndChase Woodruff[48]formerly ofWestword: 'there are some white lies and rhetorical crutches I'm trying to be more tolerant of but sorry, the notion that we're going to come out of this 'stronger than ever' is delusional.' New site planstohawk-eye Denver Public Schools A new digital informationsite[49]'dedicated to community-based commentary and advocacy-focused coverage of Denver Public Schools' has hit the scene. Launched by longtime Denver journalistAlan Gottlieb[50]andfunded byRootEd[51],BoardHawk seeks to watchdog the new school board thathas[52]'three new members skeptical of the direction the district had taken under its two previous superintendents.'The site's fiscal sponsor is The Colorado League of Charter Schools. Here's what Gottlieb said about the site in an email he circulated recently:Some of you grizzled veterans might remember that before Chalkbeat existed, I launched EdNew Colorado in January 2008, with Todd Engdahl covering the General Assembly and me soliciting and writing commentaries on the education issues of the day. As I merged EdNews with Elizabeth Green's GothamSchools to form Chalkbeat, we decided that the edgy commentaries would distract from Chalkbeat's goal of becoming the most credible and neutral education news source possible. So we did away with that component of what had been EdNews. I've always missed the give and take the commentary section provoked, and I'm hoping to revive that here. This site in no way competes with Chalkbeat, which does a stellar job covering Colorado education. What I'm trying to do is provide the op-ed page for Denvereducation coverage which has been missing for several years. Gotliebcould have launched the site sooner, 'but the Covid-19 crisis delayed us as we waited for what seemed like an appropriate moment,' he said. 'Now, however, the school board is about to [swing] back into action, so the time seems right.'Check out this new sitehere[53] where it soundslike things could get spicy. Alt-weekly wags a finger at local dailies. Then Last week in this humble little newsletter about the news behind the news I had the embarrassingresponsibility ofmaking a correction[54]about a section of the newsletter that, ironically, had highlighted a local newspaper'sfront-page correction[55]that hadalsoneeded to be corrected.No journalist wants to issue corrections; they'd rather get it right the first time.But when they screw up, which is bound to happen sometimes, they're supposed to correct them   and swiftly.Also last week, Imade the case[56]for why we're likely to see more typos, errors of fact, and other 'howlers' in daily newsprint, leading to more corrections, as more and more editors who do the proofreading are getting laid off. Amy Gillentine Sweet, who publishes The Colorado Springs Independent,took a different tack, publishing acolumn[57]in the alt-weekly under the headline 'Media should do better in times of crisis   and always.' In it wasthis[58]:When the press gets it wrong, it's just another reason for naysayers to shout, 'fake news.' And while we don't always get it right, we should always immediately correct mistakes and make sure readers understand the facts. Hey, Gazette, I'm talking to you. And to The Pueblo Chieftain, you guys down south. Get it right. When you don't, admit it and fix it. Let your readers know there was a mistake. The truth is more important than your ego. Consider last week's headline in The Gazette, claiming that Leon Kelly of El Paso County Public Health said the county was ready to reopen. They quote Kelly: 'We could open businesses tomorrow   open them all   it does not matter if people are too scared to go to those restaurants, too afraid to go to those shops. Our job is to prove that we are ready. El Paso is ready to go.' However, The Gazette failed to report the rest of his statement. Kelly took to social media to correct the record   because The Gazette didn't.The alt-weekly column about owning up to errors, omissions, and mistakes was later updated at the end with this: 'Clarification: Regarding last week's publisher's note, according to Leon Kelly, the media outlet who cut off his remarks was KRDO. WhileThe Gazettealso claimed that Kelly wanted to completely re-open the economy in its original coverage, it has since updated the story to more accurately reflect Kelly's stance.' Elsewhere in thecolumn[59], Gillentine Sweet took on The Pueblo Chieftainfor thatmajor screw-up Iflagged[60]last week. Here's howshe handled it:imagine our surprise when the Chieftain printed an editorial allegedly penned by Colorado Publishing House employee and Southeast Express General Manager and Editor Regan Foster. While Regan formerly worked at the Chieftain, she didn't write the editorial, nor did she contribute to it. She hasn't been on staff there for more than 18 months. Oops. The Chieftain is owned by GateHouse Media, which says its centralized design team in Austin made the mistake. (We believe you should keep operations local and know your community   and maybe your staff too.)On social media,Chieftain sports reporter Austin J. White asked for a clarification from the paper.Can we get a clarification @csindependent[61]? This column sure makes it sounds like the Chieftain didn't run any kind of correction. The paper also is not owned by GateHouse anymore like the story states       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/2FigvsIVE3\">https://t.co/2FigvsIVE3</url>[62]   Austin J. White (@ajw_sports) May 13, 2020[63](That's how I read the column, too. The Chieftain'sacknowledgment of its mistake is onlinehere[64].) Gillentine Sweet told me she felt she 'did say they corrected it   by blaming it on their distant designer' so she doesn't think a clarification is needed. The following day, this separate clarification appeared in thecolumn[65]: 'Some people are pointing out that GateHouse no longer exists as GateHouse. In November 2019, New Media Investment Group, the successor to GateHouse Media, acquired newspaper publisher Gannett. The two companies merged and will operate under the Gannett brand. Subsidiary papers include Pueblo Events and The Pueblo West View.' Find more ofthe alt-weekly's local coveragehere[66]. Mike Littwin moves to The Colorado Sun 'This is, sadly, my last column forThe Colorado Independent. But it's also, happily, my first column forThe Colorado Sun.' That was columnist Mike Littwin'snote to readerstoday[67], marking another chapter inthe Indy'songoingtransformation[68]. From his goodbye/hellocolumn[69]: I'm gone. I'm back. It's a weird world, but you already knew that. But first an explanation. I'm leaving The Indy's employ after seven years because my bosses, Susan Greene and Tina Griego, are going in what we call 'a different direction,' which is great for them, great for Colorado, great for journalism, but not so great for me. They are out to help save local journalism in Colorado (they'd never use the word 'save'   that's my take, which I'll explain in a bit). My mission   as I like to think of it   is not exactly to save the world, but to offer a twice-weekly alternative vision to the surreal one we're stuck with today.Now for the big question: Will his writing change? His answer:But fortunately for me in this new world, my new boss doesn't want me to change much at all. He wants me to write the column in much the same way I did it at The Indy, which is much the same way I did it at the Post, which is the much the same way I did it at the Rocky, which is much the same way I did it at the Baltimore Sun, which is much the same way I did it at the LA Times. I could go back even further (my first job was covering the Virginia Squires and Dr. J in the old ABA), but, for those keeping score, I've been at this for a long, long time   working, in various iterations, as a sports columnist, news columnist, features columnist, op-ed columnist, everything but a men's-fashion columnist.Littwinsays[70]a lot more about the new direction ofThe Colorado Independentand its editors, Susan Greene and Tina Griego, and so you should read it here. In their ownnewsletter[71]today, those editors added this: 'The Indy'sthoughtful statehouse reporter, John Herrick, and Forest Wilson, our former intern who has grown into quite the resourceful correspondent, will be ending their stints with us.' More from that note:When you come to our site this spring and summer, you'll find stories from us, from our partners such as Sandra Fish, who is helping journalists and the public root out viral misinformation, and Jeff Roberts, the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition's public-records and open-meetings watchdog. You'll find the early fruit of our reporting partnerships. We'll be highlighting journalism from the Eastern Plains to the Western Slope, from valley to mountain and points in between. You'll still be able to read Corey Hutchins's media column as he tracks massive changes to Colorado's media world. And our guest posts aren't going anywhere, so please keep submitting.'Public relations spinmeisters might frame our new mission as innovative - the first alliance nationally between a nonprofit news team, a statewide press association and an organization dedicated to the understanding that local news is a public good,' the editors alsosay[72].'Those spinmeisters would not be entirely wrong. The mission is innovative. But it is also practical, a wiser, more strategic way to marshalthe strength of newsrooms across the state and to buttress the weaknesses. And it is also an experiment.' So there you have it. Another news experiment in test-tube Colorado. *This column appears a little differently as a published version of a weekly e-mailed newsletter about Colorado local news and media.

The \"big four\" players in the US tech industry - Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon - this week faced a blizzard of inquiries on Capitol Hill into their market power, expansion plans and political leanings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The incendiary headings came at a critical moment for 'Big Tech'. Next week, Facebook, Google and Amazon will deliver quarterly earnings reports that will be closely watched by investors on Wall Street and in Australia, with markets hovering near record highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, the Morrison government is poised to imminently release findings from the competition regulator's long running digital platforms inquiry. It is widely tipped to include tough measures to regulate tech giants that may gain global traction.</p><p>From shining lights to punching bags</p><p>Until recently, the tech giants were seen as shining examples of American capitalism and ingenuity. But they have recently become convenient punching bags for politicians from both sides of politics.</p><p>Republicans believe the big tech firms, which have their headquarters in ultra-progressive cities such as Seattle and San Francisco, are inherently biased against conservatives. Meanwhile Democrats blame platforms such as Facebook and Twitter for helping spread Russian disinformation they believe helped cost Hillary Clinton the 2016 election.</p><p>While Trump's tweets make it hard for other stories to break through, it was not for lack of trying from the members of Congress involved in this week's hearings. At times the politicians seemed to be competing with each other to see who could land the most combative question.</p><p>Brad Sherman, a Democrat congressman from California, went the furthest on Wednesday, local time, when he argued that Facebook's new cryptocurrency project, Libra, may cause more damage to Americans than September 11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.</p><p>\"We're told by some that innovation is always good,\" Sherman said. \"The most innovative thing that happened this century is when Osama bin Laden got the innovative idea of flying two airplanes into towers.</p><p>\"That's the most consequential innovation. Although this may do more to endanger America than even that.\"</p><p>At Senate hearings scrutinising the Libra proposal a day earlier, Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown was almost as hostile.</p><p>\"Like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches, Facebook has burned down the house over and over, and called every arson a learning experience,\" Brown said.</p><p>\"We would be crazy to give them a chance to experiment with people's bank accounts, to use powerful tools they don't understand like monetary policy to jeopardise hardworking Americans' ability to provide for their family.\"</p><p>Trump tweeted last week that the Libra, \"will have little standing or dependability\", and that he was not a fan of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. US Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said that Facebook's proposal \"raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability\".</p><p>Facebook was represented at the hearings by David Marcus, the head of the company's new digital currency division Calibra. Marcus was aware of the need to appear humble and conciliatory given Federal Trade Commission last week fined Facebook US$5 billion ($7.1 billion) for mishandling users' personal information.</p><p>He said the company would not proceed with its plan to launch Libra next year until it receives full government approval.</p><p>\"We know we need to take the time to get this right,\" Marcus said.</p><p>\"I know we have to earn people's trust for a very long period of time.\"</p><p>He stressed the consumer benefits that could come from the online currency - including allowing people to shift money around the world without paying exorbitant transaction and currency conversion fees.</p><p>Some senators did defend Facebook, with Republican Pat Toomey saying \"to strangle this baby in the crib is wildly premature\".</p><p>Later that day, representatives from the \"big four\" tech firms appeared before a House Judiciary Committee investigation into competition in the digital marketplace. The subcommittee is examining the tools the federal government has to rein in the dominance of monopoly firms in the online commerce and communication sectors.</p><p>\"In an effort to promote and continue this new economy, Congress and antitrust enforcers allowed these firms to regulate themselves with little oversight,\" Democrat David Cicilline said at the beginning of the hearings. \"But as a result, the internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and growingly hostile to innovation and entrepreneurship.\"</p><p>Amazon, in particular, faced questions about whether it was stifling competition by selling its own branded products as well as goods from third-party vendors.</p><p>Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton said Amazon does not alter its algorithms to ensure that Amazon products appear higher in the platform's search function.

So far, it hasn't been. When, in the world of privacy, did signing a virtual blank check get to be a good idea?  </p><p>That's what's happening in Chicago, where police say they will soon announce a pilot program with the video doorbell company Ring to expand the Police Department's surveillance capabilities. As Chicago Sun-Times reporter David Struett reported Wednesday, at least 25 suburban police departments have already signed up, including Arlington Heights, Cicero, Naperville and Aurora.<br/><br/> When new technology comes along, it's always wise to investigate how it might make us safer. But the decision on how to use it should be a matter of public debate and discussion from the start.<br/><br/> So far, it hasn't been.<br/><br/> For example, without thorough public discussion, Chicago police and the CTA already have gained access to facial-recognition technology. Police say it is seldom used, but that's not good enough, especially because electronic doorbells could expand the use of facial recognition. The public needs to know exactly what the capabilities are  and have a chance to put sensible limits in place.<br/><br/> Using partnerships with Ring, more than 400 police departments across the country can get a look at what is going on in neighborhoods through video captured by millions of internet-connected electronic doorbells, which peer at everything in front of them, including houses across the street and elsewhere on the block.<br/><br/> The new high-resolution electronic eyes can keep tabs on what is going on in vast swaths of the city, creating a sort of digital neighborhood watch. If video provided to police by a homeowner helps solve a crime, that is a clear benefit.<br/><br/> But the use of something with so much impact on our privacy  and the ability to live our lives without constantly being recorded  should be considered an important public policy topic, not something worked out in a contract between police and a private company. Policymakers and the public should get a chance to weigh in. Protecting people's privacy is the role of policymakers and government officials, not big tech companies, such as Amazon, which owns Ring.<br/><br/> Under the current plan, police could use Ring's app to ask residents for video shared to its \"Neighbors\" feature, which has shown such things as package thieves and even a drive-by shooting in Englewood. To get the video, police could ask only for a limited time range and an area of up to a half of a square mile and would have to provide a case number. Ring then would forward the request to customers for their consent.<br/><br/> But the Ring doorbells are not carefully regulated. Though most undoubtedly face the street, others could easily be installed on back doors, where they could capture what neighbors are up to in their own backyards. Once those images are recorded, no one can be certain where that video information will turn up. And, of course, Ring can change its privacy policies at any point in the future.<br/><br/>Amazon already has facial recognition technology, which could at some point be incorporated into Ring. At that point, countless people who have been involved in the criminal justice system  even if they were exonerated  might find their own faces are a modern scarlet letter, identifying them as potential criminals wherever they go. Others might carry that scarlet letter simply through mistakes in the recognition technology.<br/><br/> Technology companies assure us they have privacy standards, but the flaw in that argument was painfully illustrated when Cambridge Analytica harvested raw data from 87 million Facebook users leading up to the 2016 presidential election. It doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to envision a world where video of our daily lives is just another item in electronic dossiers that gigantic data brokers assemble and sell, revealing where we go, who we meet, what we buy, what we do and even how we vote.<br/><br/> Moreover, data stored in all sorts of electronic systems have proved to be vulnerable to hacking and subsequent widespread dissemination.<br/><br/> State Sen. Cristina Castro, D-Elgin, who plans to introduce legislation to curb unfettered access to video gathered by electronic doorbells while providing police with greater ability to solve crimes, said she looks forward to a \"robust discussion.\" We hope that discussion happens.<br/><br/> As the Hong Kong protests continue, we hear many criticisms of China for becoming a surveillance state. We have to ask ourselves why we would allow that to happen here.<br/><br/> Chicago already has a network of about 45,000 surveillance cameras of its own. We are rapidly losing our ability to be anonymous in public places.<br/><br/> We need to sort all this out now in thoughtful policy discussions at which all interested parties are heard from  not wait until after abuses have occurred.<br/><br/> Send letters to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@suntimes.com\">letters@suntimes.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHISUN-172301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHISUN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X33-D751-F0BC-M1SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11064</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Sun-Times Media, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Sun-Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004XG3</classCode><className>CHICAGO SUN-TIMES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Interestingly, the research showed higher, more sustained, humanin levels in children of centenarians compared to a control group. In some species, including worms and mice, the team went on to discover that modifying their genes to increase humanin levels increased lifespan. </p><p>However, this was at the expense of the number of offspring the animals produced. Scientists also looked at cerebral spinal fluid from Alzheimer's patients and a control group, finding that humanin levels were significantly lower in the group with Alzheimer's.  This new study is part of a growing body of research into the importance of humanin in delaying the aging process, and it is now hoped that it could pave the way for the development of mitochondrial protein-based treatments for age-related disease and conditions.  Results look good in mice and worms. There is less fat and more lean body mass and longer lives. Abstract Humanin is a member of a new family of peptides that are encoded by short open reading frames within the mitochondrial genome. It is conserved in animals and is both neuroprotective and cytoprotective. Here we report that in C. elegans the overexpression of humanin is sufficient to increase lifespan, dependent on daf-16/Foxo. Humanin transgenic mice have many phenotypes that overlap with the worm phenotypes and, similar to exogenous humanin treatment, have increased protection against toxic insults. Treating middle-aged mice twice weekly with the potent humanin analogue HNG, humanin improves metabolic healthspan parameters and reduces inflammatory markers. In multiple species, humanin levels generally decline with age, but here we show that levels are surprisingly stable in the naked mole-rat, a model of negligible senescence. Furthermore, in children of centenarians, who are more likely to become centenarians themselves, circulating humanin levels are much greater than age-matched control subjects. Further linking humanin to healthspan, we observe that humanin levels are decreased in human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes). Together, these studies are the first to demonstrate that humanin is linked to improved healthspan and increased lifespan.

In 2015, Google disclosed that one in twenty search queries were health-related, and announced that it would be working with doctors to make sure that reliable information appeared high up in results. Such safeguarding appears to have been absent when it came to advertising.</p><p>As we report today, advertisements for supplements targeted at those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia have been allowed to appear at the top of results shown to people searching for those conditions, despite the supplements having no proven benefits. They include a \u00a338 per month product that promises to \"promote memory\" via ingredients such as avocado, and a drink costing \u00a33.50 per day that a clinical trial has shown is ineffective at tackling dementia.</p><p>As many as 850,000 British people suffer from forms of dementia and many of them are, by definition, vulnerable. None of these products themselves claims directly to be able to work miracles, and most would be breaking the law if they did. Some even explicitly say on their packaging that they are not intended to treat or prevent disease. Yet sellers benefit by buying from Google the right to appear when queries about pills or supplements for Alzheimer's or dementia are typed into the search box. The dishonesty is invisible. Paid-for searches fall under the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, but a regulator cannot police what it cannot see.</p><p>Since The Times approached Google for comment, these advertisements have been removed. Yet it is not the job of traditional media to police far wealthier technology giants. Last month the Cairncross Review, which studied threats to highquality journalism, warned that the domination of digital advertising by companies such as Facebook and Google threatened local and national newspapers. Between them, the two companies took 54 per cent of British digital advertising in 2017.</p><p>The Furman Review, commissioned last year by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, from a panel led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman, predicts that big tech's dominance of online advertising will only increase. Short of these companies being broken up, as suggested both by Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, and by News UK, the owner of The Times, this seems inevitable. Being less opaque, traditional advertising could never permit such exploitative mendacity.</p><p>Online advertising, and the data targeting that facilitates it, is the cash cow that has seen companies such as Facebook and Google swell to become giants, absorbing or crushing a huge array of potential rivals. Data is harvested from users in ways that few understand, and then weaponised back at them. Both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner have warned of the impact of such practices when deployed in relatively unregulated political advertising.</p><p>The targeting of dubious pseudomedical products at vulnerable people is a facet of the same problem. Once again, new technology appears to be leading us into an ungoverned and potentially ungovernable Wild West, from which some of the richest companies in the world profit enormously while disavowing themselves of any responsibility.

In 2015, Google disclosed that one in twenty search queries were health-related, and announced that it would be working with doctors to make sure that reliable information appeared high up in results. Such safeguarding appears to have been absent when it came to advertising.</p><p>As we report today, advertisements for supplements targeted at those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia have been allowed to appear at the top of results shown to people searching for those conditions, despite the supplements having no proven benefits. They include a \u00a338 per month product that promises to \"promote memory\" via ingredients such as avocado, and a drink costing \u00a33.50 per day that a clinical trial has shown is ineffective at tackling dementia.</p><p>As many as 850,000 British people suffer from forms of dementia and many of them are, by definition, vulnerable. None of these products themselves claims directly to be able to work miracles, and most would be breaking the law if they did. Some even explicitly say on their packaging that they are not intended to treat or prevent disease. Yet sellers benefit by buying from Google the right to appear when queries about pills or supplements for Alzheimer's or dementia are typed into the search box. The dishonesty is invisible. Paid-for searches fall under the remit of the Advertising Standards Authority, but a regulator cannot police what it cannot see.</p><p>Since The Times approached Google for comment, these advertisements have been removed. Yet it is not the job of traditional media to police far wealthier technology giants. Last month the Cairncross Review, which studied threats to highquality journalism, warned that the domination of digital advertising by companies such as Facebook and Google threatened local and national newspapers. Between them, the two companies took 54 per cent of British digital advertising in 2017.</p><p>The Furman Review, commissioned last year by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, from a panel led by the Harvard academic Jason Furman, predicts that big tech's dominance of online advertising will only increase. Short of these companies being broken up, as suggested both by Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic presidential candidate, and by News UK, the owner of The Times, this seems inevitable. Being less opaque, traditional advertising could never permit such exploitative mendacity.</p><p>Online advertising, and the data targeting that facilitates it, is the cash cow that has seen companies such as Facebook and Google swell to become giants, absorbing or crushing a huge array of potential rivals. Data is harvested from users in ways that few understand, and then weaponised back at them. Both the Electoral Commission and the Information Commissioner have warned of the impact of such practices when deployed in relatively unregulated political advertising.</p><p>The targeting of dubious pseudomedical products at vulnerable people is a facet of the same problem. Once again, new technology appears to be leading us into an ungoverned and potentially ungovernable Wild West, from which some of the richest companies in the world profit enormously while disavowing themselves of any responsibility. Once more, the need for new, effective regulation for these companies could not be more clear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-147672843</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VR4-8K41-DYTY-C0CM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Let's also recognize, however, that technologies largely invented and developed in the United States over time have changed the world ? mostly for the better.</p><p>The story of Big Tech's sins is a familiar one. Facebook wasn't a company until 2004. About a decade ago the young company allowed outside firms to mine company data for many secondary purposes. Just a few years later Facebook took another turn and reined in the outside data-mining so it could better monetize that information itself.</p><p>Somewhere along the way, data on roughly 87 million Facebook users was improperly passed along to Cambridge Analytics, and the ongoing privacy storm began. The door was open for more government scrutiny.</p><p>Amazon, Apple and Google have been subject to billions of dollars in fines, mainly levied by the European Union, the irony of which is not lost on those who are hard-pressed to name more than a handful of EU tech companies that are game-changers.</p><p>Before the digital pitchforks are hoisted too high, it's worth considering the good that has come from innovation that was only a bold idea at the start of the 21st century.</p><p>Social media is largely the product of a convergence of technologies that made it much easier, faster and cheaper to communicate with friends, colleagues and strangers alike ? anywhere, anytime. It has empowered people and, in many ways, democratized news, business startups and social action.</p><p>Dov Seidman, the CEO of corporate ethics and compliance firm LRN, believes the tools themselves are not the problem ? but how we choose to use them. The same technologies that can foster relationships and give people a voice \"can also breed isolation, embolden racists, and empower digital bullies and nefarious actors,\" Seidman has said. \"We now live in the era of behavior. We are thrust together technologically. We have become so connected that we are ? ethically if not morally connected.\"</p><p>The technology revolution that began with the birth of the internet is maturing in ways that were hard to imagine. Just as the first three Industrial Revolutions (machines, power and early computers) led to unintended consequences in society and democracy, so is the Fourth Industrial Revolution changing the world through mobile technologies, machine learning and open source software.</p><p>Those changes will remake how we get our food, clothing, shelter, health care, education, entertainment and more. They may also lead society into uncharted territory that disrupts long-held values and beliefs.</p><p>It can be scary. That's why some members of Congress and policymakers elsewhere have looked to rein in tech, sometimes without fully considering the implications. For example, efforts are underway in Congress to bring back Obama-era \"net neutrality\" rules, even if the rollback has not created the predatory disaster predicted by supporters. Companies are competing to increase data speeds, not to reduce them.</p><p>Some states have pushed ahead with privacy legislation, not realizing they could create islands that discourage interstate commerce. A reasoned federal approach is the better answer.</p><p>Regulation has its place. It must be carefully implemented, however, as to not kill America's digital golden goose.</p><p>Technology itself is becoming part of the answer, as decentralized technologies have the potential to weaken the grip of Big Tech while enhancing cyber-security.</p><p>An expert on the rise of decentralized technologies will visit Madison in early November for the Wisconsin Early Stage Symposium. Investor and tech veteran Jeff Schumacher, who has long been a part of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, will speak Nov. 7 on the coming wave of innovation.</p><p>We can urge government to \"unfriend\" Big Tech or we can recognize that reactive regulation isn't the answer to problems linked, at least in part, to our own behavior.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WISTJL-19091331428772</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WISTJL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2F-GK21-DY37-503G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">145460</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Madison Newspapers, Inc.

I'm Don Lemon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In just nine and a half hours, 8.30 a.m. Eastern Time, obviously tomorrow morning, Robert Mueller, the former special counsel will raise his right hand and begin his public testimony on Capitol Hill. He will be questioned for the first few hours by members of the House Judiciary Committee and then he'll appear before the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, sources are telling CNN that President Trump is irritated by the thought of Robert Mueller testifying in public, not so much anxious about it, but irritated also he has been quizzing aides about what he can expect to hear tomorrow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One major question hanging over Robert Mueller's testimony could the outcome sway undecided House Democrats on impeachment?</p><p>CNN's Manu Raju asked some lawmakers about that and some of them sidestep the question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Do you think tomorrow's testimony could change the House's course on impeachment?</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We want to make sure that the facts are clearly communicated to the American people. And Bob Mueller will be in a position to do that.</p><p>RAJU: Do you think tomorrow's hearing will move the dial on impeachment at all?</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): I think tomorrow's hearing is very important. It will be the first opportunity for most Americans to actually hear what the special counsel's report found, the evidence he uncovered.</p><p>RAJU: Do you think that tomorrow will change the course of impeachment here in the House?</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Look, it's hard to know exactly what's going to come out of this hearing. But I do think that probably the most important thing that we can expect that we will get is that Mueller will tell us what was in the report.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: So, let's get to the big picture right now. Here to discuss, Shimon Prokupecz, Nia-Malika Henderson, and Julian Epstein who served as chief counsel for House Judiciary Committee Democrats during the Clinton impeachment.</p><p>So, thank you all for joining us. This is a very important time, very important day coming up shortly. Shimon, I'm going to start with you. Democrats are trying of course lower the expectation but the question, there is no question that Mueller's testimony is a big deal for both sides. They have a lot riding on it.</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Certainly, they do both have a lot riding on it but, you know, you can make a fair argument here that the Democrats have a lot more riding on it. They are the ones that wanted him to come in. It's their committee. They are in charge. They have a lot more at stake in of this.</p><p>And for the Republicans, it's really, you know, it would seem at this point it's all about dirtying up Mueller as much as they can. And for the Democrats, it's going to be more about shoring him up, trying to show that his investigation was effective and that there were conclusions, important conclusions that he came to that now the public really needs to hear from him, in most cases as you said, for the first time.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. Julian, listen, you were -- you served as top counsel to the Democrats during the Clinton impeachment. So how tough is it going to be for Democrats really to get their points across to get what they need done in the time constraints with a reluctant witness. That's not going to be an easy task, is it?</p><p>JULIAN EPSTEIN, FORMER DEMOCRATIC CHIEF COUNSEL, HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Hard. And this is a be careful what you wish for moment for Democrats. So, I think Shimon is exactly right.</p><p>LEMON: Why do you say that?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Because I think Democrats have more to lose here. I think the public right now is about 21 percent for impeachment and Mueller has unfortunately set the terms of the debate.</p><p>I mean, the notion in 1998 that we would have let Ken Starr tell us he was only going to come in for three hours. I mean, what is it that Bob Mueller have to do that's more important than testify on something that so critically important. And this notion about limiting the testimony to three hours I think is just wrong.</p><p>I think secondly, this notion --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: Wait, go back. Because why do you think this is wrong?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Because I think that the committee needs much more time to examine a 400-plus page report that is incredibly detailed about the Russian attack on the United States and the obstruction of justice questions.</p><p>LEMON: OK.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I just think it's -- I just think it's absurdly -- it's absurdly artificial. But secondly, I think there is a bigger question. This notion that Mueller has that he cannot commit on the question of obstruction of justice because the president doesn't have the right to defend himself, he just pulled that out of thin air.</p><p>There is no statute. There is no regulation. There is no principle that exists in the Justice Department on president.</p><p>When Ken Starr gave us the report in 1998, he detailed over a dozen instances in which he thought the president had violated criminal laws on obstruction of justice and perjury. And the president was able to go through impeachment process and Clinton came out of that process feeling vindicated.</p><p>[23:05:01] So this notion that he can't commit on this question about whether he thinks there was obstruction of justice is just -- there is no legal foundation. He literally made that up.</p><p>And I think the Democrats here have this notion that they don't want to antagonize him because he's the star witness but I think letting him set the terms of the debate on that question has been a huge mistake.</p><p>And I think by the same token, they should also ask him the same way that Ken Starr committed in 1998 to identifying at least a dozen instances of impeachable conduct. I think if Mueller doesn't want to answer whether he thinks at least the four instances that he outlined in the report were obstruction of justice, there is no legal reason, no president reason, no other reason why he can't say that this conduct, this misconduct is an impeachable offense.</p><p>And I think they should push him on that. And I think the Democrat have kind of taken, have taken kind of a soft peddle to that and I think that's a mistake because I think what we'll have at the end of this is a Rorschach test --</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>EPSTEIN: -- where the Republican see what they want to see --</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>EPSTEIN: -- the Democrats see what they want to see and we're going to be status quo on Friday.</p><p>LEMON: That's some -- that's my question to you. What about the Republicans? What are we going to hear from this? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Yes. I mean, I think we can expect that the Republicans will carry the president's water and carry the president's message about this, right? That it's rigged. There are 18 or so angry Democrats who are part of this they are going to get into the roots of the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: I say mostly Republicans?</p><p>HENDERSON: I think, yes, yes. I mean, that's right, that's right. And obviously you have in Mueller who is also a registered Republican, right?</p><p>LEMON: Right.</p><p>HENDERSON: But I think you can expect that they are going to go after Bob Mueller and as (Inaudible) said, they are basically going to try to muddy him up. And I think this is where we're going to see sort of a Mueller that we haven't really seen before. Certainly recently.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: But don't you think --</p><p>HENDERSON: Because he has tangoed with these folks before. Louie Gohmert, Jim Jordan, for instance, as well.</p><p>LEMON: But don't you think that could backfire on them.</p><p>HENDERSON: I think so. I think that's right. I mean, do they risk sort of going too far? Here is Bob Mueller who has a sterling reputation came in with a sterling reputation, right, as sort of bipartisan reputation.</p><p>So, if you have these folks, I think going after him in a way and kind of having him to defend the reputation of the FBI --</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>HENDERSON: -- that could be a sticky situation for some --</p><p>LEMON: Wait. Hold on, Shimon.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: Just to make the point of what Nia is talking about, and I'll let you guys. Let's just listen to Lindsey Graham. Manu Raju caught up with Lindsey Graham. Let's watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): I don't think it's going to change public opinion. Having been involved in the Clinton impeachment if the public is not with you, you'll pay a price and I don't think anything Mueller can say that's going to change anybody's mind. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: You said Rorschach test -- but discuss.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: The thing that I want us also make, you know --</p><p>HNDERSON: Yes.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- I don't know how much this could backfire on Republicans and why I feel that way because no one is going to have any kind of sympathy for Robert Mueller. He's not going to come -- he's not going to be a sympathetic witness.</p><p>I think some folks actually are going to get irritated by his responses and by him by his trying to escape some of these answers. So, I think that's going to be interesting.</p><p>And perhaps for the Republicans, you know, that's probably what they maybe -- maybe that's what they're going to want from him. So, I think that's going to be interesting the dynamics in terms of how Mueller is going to respond to a lot of these questions and does he come out sympathetic.</p><p>HENDERSON: And the idea is he going to be sort of treated like a hostile witness --</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Right.</p><p>HENDERSON: -- by both parties? Right? The Democrats and the Republicans? It will be fascinating to see.</p><p>EPSTEIN: So, I played defense. I played defense in 1998 during the Clinton impeachment and the Republicans have an easier role than the Democrats particularly when the public opinion is on your side on the question on impeachment.</p><p>Public opinion is not on your side -- on their side in terms of whether the president committed misconduct. Sixty percent of the public by in large thinks the president committed some kind of misconduct and has been lying about it but they're not there on the question of impeachment.</p><p>I think the left got outweigh too in front of the facts before the Mueller report in terms of alleging conspiracy on the underlying Russian interference question. I think the left, I think the media, I think there is a lot of guilt on the left for going, getting too far out in front of the facts and there is a boy who cried wolf syndrome now where because there was no evidence on underlying criminal conspiracy, there is kind of a boy who cried wolf. There is nothing in the report that was as serious as what's being alleged --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: And --</p><p>EPSTEIN: So that's a problem -- LEMON: That's the evidence in the rise to the level of -- this is how it was put -- it didn't rise to criminal.</p><p>EPSTEIN: So, criminal, right. Precisely. But I think now the Republicans, if they are smart, I know they want to kind of self- medicate and feed their base about the investigating the investigators but if they are smart, all they really need to do, they're kind of going into the fourth quarter right now ahead.</p><p>All they have to do is say didn't you say no criminal conspiracy, Mr. Mueller, and aren't you saying you're not ready to commit on a question of obstruction of justice --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: But let me just play devil's advocate here. Because if you actually read the report, you say -- where it says it didn't rise -- the evidence didn't rise to the level, yes, it wasn't sufficient.</p><p>So, doesn't that have to do, does it have to do with how Barr summarized the report in some way and that's --</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well --</p><p>LEMON: -- public opinion? Because you're saying they got out in front but if you actually read the report --</p><p>EPSTEIN: So, there is evidence of illegal conduct not -- in my opinion just not sufficient --</p><p>[23:10:01] LEMON: Got it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: -- evidence to bring a charge.</p><p>LEMON: Got it.</p><p>EPSTEIN: I think that also raises the question about what Mueller would have done if there was, what he would have said if there is sufficient evidence given what he's saying on obstruction.</p><p>So, I think there is evidence. Democrats can kind of start to pull that out, they can go in the four areas of obstruction of justice and they can say can you repeat, Mr. Mueller that there is substantial evidence of obstruction of justice? That can be persuasive.</p><p>But remember, when John Dean testified before the Watergate committee in 1973, 80 million people were watching. My guess is about 15 or 20 million will be watching tomorrow and most of the public has made their mind up.</p><p>So, Democrats I think for a whole host of reasons that are too detailed to get into in this conversation are kind of now playing defense or now playing catch up and I'm not sure they are going --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) LEMON: OK. Here -- this is the difference. You're right about that. But back then there were three channels, right?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: And no 24-hour --</p><p>EPSTEIN: And no Twitter.</p><p>LEMON: And all of that. Because those sound bites will get repeated and repeated and put on other media.</p><p>EPSTEIN: And that's the bigger problem.</p><p>HENDERSON: Yes. And the president will sort of do his thing to sort of reinterpret it and repackage.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>HENDERSON: He's going to West Virginia.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>HENDERSON: He's going to be making a speech later that night. So we'll see that as well.</p><p>LEMON: I've got to go. The significance of his assistant being --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PROKUPECZ: I think it's very significant --</p><p>LEMON: OK.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: -- and his protector. This guy has been with him.</p><p>LEMON: Aaron Zebley.</p><p>PROKUPECZ: Aaron Zebley has been with him since his days at the FBI, he was chief of staff is his right-hand man. I think it is significant. He is going to be there to protect him.</p><p>LEMON: All right. Thank you all. I appreciate it.</p><p>FBI Director Christopher Wray warned again today of the election threat from Russia. Is this country doing enough to stop it? The former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper weighs in, next.</p><p>[23:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: All eyes on Washington as the former special counsel Robert Mueller prepares to testify in front of the House judiciary and intel committees beginning tomorrow at 8.30. Here to discuss, James Clapper, the former Director of National Intelligence. Director, good to see you.</p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE: Good to see you, Don.</p><p>LEMON: Listen, this is going to be, I think this is the most highly anticipated Congressional testimony in decades tomorrow. What are you expecting?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, it is highly anticipated no question about that and I think in the end, it's probably going to be a little anticlimactic. I don't think it's going to move the needle of opinion. One way or another I think it's going to reinforce, you know, whatever your view is of the president it's just simply going -- people are going to cherry pick and the reinforce their view.</p><p>LEMON: You've been very good over the last couple of years of helping us see the forest for the trees here. Do you think that -- and listen, the report shows that they found some very disturbing, just to say evidence in the report, right, findings in the report. Do you think Americans are going to get any clarity, is it going to get any clarity, is it going to get any clearer tomorrow from Robert Mueller?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I do think having said what I said that this still is a very useful thing because most Americans I don't think have read the entire report. Maybe scanned it and read parts of it and this I think this will bring it to life, you know, of face behind the 448 pages.</p><p>So, in some ways, depending on how the Democrats manage this, I think it can be very informative. The other point I make, Don, is I hope director Mueller will speak about the thing that most concerned me more so than collusion or extortion is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: Influence.</p><p>CLAPPER: -- the Russian interference in our election process.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>CLAPPER: -- which is Director Wray reaffirmed is continuing and this is long-term a really profound threat to this country.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>CLAPPER: And I hope Director Mueller, Special Counsel Mueller speaks to that.</p><p>LEMON: Director Wray spoke today about exactly what you're talking about. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): Are the Russians still trying to interfere in our election system?</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WRAY, DIRECTOR, FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION: The Russians are absolutely intent on trying to interfere with our elections through foreign influence --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAHAM: Is it fair to say to think that everything we've done against Russia has not deterred them enough? All the sanctions, all the talk, they are still at it?</p><p>WRAY: Well, my view is until they stop, they haven't been deterred enough.</p><p>GRAHAM: And they're still doing it?</p><p>WRAY: Yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEMON: So, everyone seems to recognize the threat but is enough being done to stop it?</p><p>CLAPPER: Obviously not. And I think Director Wray reaffirm that. And I think there's an important point to be made her as well. We dwell a lot on cybersecurity and the securing the voter apparatus, what concerns me more than that is the influence on people's minds on opinions, which the Russians have learned to exploit as we, to a fairly well and they are going to continue that even more aggressively. I predict in 2020.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. The director, Director Wray also spoke about the issue of deep fakes, right?</p><p>CLAPPER: Right.</p><p>LEMON: Which is highly advanced digital doctored media clips. You've read about deep fakes. We've been reading about all that. Is this something the average American you think should be worried about?</p><p>CLAPPER: Absolutely. This is just yet another and, in this case, insidious tool that people with nefarious motives can use to manipulate public opinion and political views.</p><p>And you know, Mike Hayden has made this point and I'll reinforce it (Inaudible) I heard for him about. This is, to me, just part of the general assault on truth in this country and those endeavors and institutions that depend on truth.</p><p>And when the truth is harder and harder to come by, and when people are out consciously trying to pervert truth and these deep fakes represent that and that's a tremendous threat.</p><p>And when I'm out at colleges and universities, I try to implore students that please don't believe everything you see, read and hear on the internet. And getting people to question that is my concern because the Russians will -- are going and have exploited that weakness.</p><p>[23:20:03] And they have used it to heighten the divisiveness and polarization in this country and they are going to continue to do it.</p><p>LEMON: I want to speak with you about some Politico reporting. And they are reporting the president has been speaking to intelligence -- to the intelligence committee chairman Devin Nunes about a potential replacement for Dan Coats, the director national intelligence. How big of a loss would that be if he does leave?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, obviously, it depends on who replaces him. Personally, I think it would be -- probably not doing him any favors here by praising him but I think the role of Dan Coats and the job he's done in a very difficult circumstance.</p><p>He is huge to the almost holy written intelligence of truth to power even though that cost him. And now we're seeing the all too familiar pattern of media buzz about replacements. So, regrettably, he's probably on his way out.</p><p>LEMON: OK. So then let's speak, you said media buzz about replacement because Politico in that same piece it goes on to mention that Devin Nunes himself might be in the mix for that role. You used to be director of national intelligence. Is that a good replacement for Dan Coats?</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, I don't think anyone who is an ideologue and who is a cross light, an acolyte (Ph) of the president which Devin Nunes is, can't -- new to the principle what the autonomy of independence that needs to exist with the leadership in the intelligence community.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. It's always a pleasure.</p><p>CLAPPER: Thanks, Don.</p><p>LEMON: How's our friend doing, Mr. Hayden?</p><p>CLAPPER: He is doing great.</p><p>LEMON: I haven't spoken to him in a couple weeks but I owe him a phone call.</p><p>CLAPPER: Well, he and I had breakfast a week or so ago and he was terrific.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. I hope he's watching. If not, say hello. I'll talk to him soon, though. Thank you very much.</p><p>Joe Biden unveiling a new criminal justice plan ahead of next week's CNN Democratic presidential debates. Will it deflect attention from the controversial 1994 crime bill he helped write that contributed to mass incarceration?</p><p>[23:25:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: With one week to go until CNN's Democratic presidential debates, Joe Biden is unveiling his criminal justice reform plan, a plan he hopes will deflect attacks over the controversial 1994 crime bill that he wrote 25 years ago.</p><p>Let's discuss now. Keith Boykin is here, as well as Bakari Sellers who supports Senator Kamala Harris.</p><p>Good evening, gentlemen. So good to see you.</p><p>Keith, I'm going to start with you. So, the vice president -- former vice president's new plan includes recommendations from CBC members and seeks to reduce the number of people in prison while also reducing crime.</p><p>So, let me just read the main points, OK? Creating a $20 billion grant program aimed at pressuring states to eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent crimes, incentivizing inmates to complete educational and rehabilitation programs, retroactively eliminating the disparity between sentences for crack and powder cocaine and decriminalizing marijuana use.</p><p>So, my question is, does this plan help take the heat off of him for this 1994 crime bill?</p><p>KEITH BOYKIN, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes, and no. I mean, it's important step for Joe Biden to take. He has been criticized about his bill and the crime bill, and it's not his vote but his authorship of the crime bill.</p><p>And I think that this is an acknowledgement that we've moved in the wrong direction some 20-odd years ago. And it's time to move in a different direction.</p><p>Having said that, people aren't going to forget what happened in the 1990s. I mean, Hillary Clinton was a pillory in attack for her support of the crime bill when she wasn't even a U.S. senator at the time. She wasn't even the president of the United States. She wasn't the author of the bill.</p><p>So, I think that Joe Biden is still going to have to answer those questions just like Bernie Sanders is going to have to answer the questions for why he voted for it and anybody else who is supportive of it.</p><p>LEMON: Yes.</p><p>BOYKIN: The Democratic Party of 1994 is not the Democratic Party of 2020.</p><p>LEMON: Yes. Bakari, Senator Cory Booker has already come out swinging -- sending out a statement that reads \"Joe Biden had more than 40 years to get this right. The proud architect of the failed system is not the right person to fix it.\"</p><p>I mean, listen, Biden has done a lot over his 40 years in public service and was not the only person responsible for the crime bill. Shouldn't voters give his plan a chance now? BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, he has done a lot over the past 40 years and part of that is the 1984 Comprehensive Crime Control Act that he did with Strom Thurmond in '86, '88, and '94 crime bill.</p><p>All of these things established what we now know to be mass incarceration. People just want to look at 1984 but it's very difficult when you have someone who created this mass incarceration complex that we have.</p><p>I mean, it's an interesting juxtaposition. Before he was with Barack Obama, what type of legislator was he. And when you go back and you look at the record and you're talking about alleviating this crack and cocaine sentencing disparities, well, you helped create those.</p><p>When you talk about investing in juvenile justice, well, you are the reason that many juveniles, two-thirds of those juveniles that were actually sentenced as adults that were African- American, you're the reason that that happened. You created these laws over the 40 years that you were there without Barack Obama at your side. So, what type of leader will you be? You have to reconcile that record.</p><p>And just to clarify one thing, one of the biggest sticking points and I think Keith will agree with me on this, is that Joe Biden, it's kind of tricky in the language that they use because it says that he decriminalizes marijuana.</p><p>But what he does is he says that marijuana could -- marijuana can be used for medical purposes. However, he does not legalize marijuana on the federal level which is a huge problem.</p><p>LEMON: So, Keith, you heard what Bakari said there and you know, Biden is going to be sandwiched in between Senators Booker and Harris at the CNN debate next week.</p><p>[23:30:07] I mean, Booker seems ready to fight. You saw -- read the statement that he put out. Harris attacked him at the last debate. Are we likely to see a pile on here?</p><p>BOYKIN: I think -- I wouldn't say there's going to be pile on, but I think there's going to be a challenge for Joe Biden. And the question is will he be prepared to face that challenge this time. The first debate, he looked like a deer in the headlights when Kamala Harris asked him about the bussing issue.</p><p>In this debate, he's got to come prepared. He's got to have a better answer. But he's going to be sandwiched in between Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, so I'm not sure if he's going to be ready for that or not.</p><p>I just want to go back to something Bakari said because I thought that Kamala Harris's proposal -- you can correct me if I'm wrong -- also decriminalizes marijuana but it doesn't --</p><p>LEMON: Yeah.</p><p>BOYKIN: -- legalize it. Does it?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEMON: It decriminalizes marijuana on the federal level, which is what the distinction that Bakari was making, but Bakari, before you weigh in, as the attorney general in 2010, she opposed legalizing marijuana.</p><p>BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Right.</p><p>LEMON: She has her own record on that, as well, to defend.</p><p>SELLERS: No question. That's why it's very important that you reconcile those records. And yes, the difference is, one is legalizing marijuana on the federal level, which is a clear distinction. The other one is saying decriminalize medical marijuana only for the purposes of medical usage. And so that's a very clear distinction.</p><p>One of the things that Senator Harris did today when she put forth this piece of legislation, she also talked about the fact that -- and both want to do this, let's be honest and fair -- both want to expunge the records of individuals who have marijuana convictions, but Senator Harris actually went a step further and said, \"We're going to tax this federal marijuana and the reason we're going to tax it is so that it can help those individuals who have been disenfranchised, those individuals who had these convictions, and individuals who want to get into this industry, and so it's a robust piece of legislation.\"</p><p>Look, everybody has a record. Senator Harris has her own criminal justice record, and she's going to have to reconcile, as well.</p><p>LEMON: OK. So, you didn't defend her record. On her own record, as I said, the question was, she has her own record to defend, not in comparison to the vice president, but she has her own record to defend?</p><p>SELLERS: Correct. There is no doubt about it. I think that I can honestly sit here and say that in 2010, Senator Harris was wrong on that, so I was happy to see that progression. But I also think that it's fair to say that one of the things that you have to do is recognize when you were wrong, recognize the evolution.</p><p>And one of the things that's been the biggest hold up for people like Jim Clyburn, for those who actually signed on to the 1994 crime bill, for even Joe Biden, it's very difficult to look at a camera and say \"I was wrong.\" Bobby Rush has had a mea culpa. Dick Durbin has said that this was one of the worst votes he has ever taken in his life.</p><p>If Joe Biden remained steadfast in that position while there are many black and brown people who have suffered in his hands, then this is not going to go over well. So that's going to be an interesting thing to see on that stage. Senator Harris has recognized she was wrong and she had to because she was, and she has evolved on that issue with what we know to be one of the better marijuana positions we have.</p><p>LEMON: Keith, I want to give you the last word.</p><p>BOYKIN: Yeah, I think that's important because I don't think that Kamala Harris or Joe Biden or any of the candidates for that matter that I am aware of come to this whole debate with perfect records. And the question isn't who has the perfect record. The question is: What are the best policies that they are proposing? And secondly, are they willing to acknowledge their mistakes in the past? You know, I don't believe --</p><p>LEMON: Correct.</p><p>BOYKIN: -- in rehabilitation or forgiveness without contrition. And I think that -- one of the things I do worry about with Joe Biden is his stubbornness sometimes, his unwillingness to acknowledge that he made a mistake. I mean, even Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton have acknowledged that the crime bill went too far. I can't imagine why Joe Biden wouldn't also agree with that, too, and apologize for that or acknowledge at least, if not apologized, acknowledge his mistakes and propose something that movers us forward.</p><p>LEMON: Keith, Bakari, thank you very much. I'll see you guys soon. Don't miss the CNN democratic presidential debates next Tuesday and Wednesday. Dana Bash, Jake Tapper, and I are going to moderate, July 30th and 31st, beginning at 8:00 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>A high school student who was born in Dallas and is a U.S. citizen spent three weeks behind bars until he was released from ICE custody today. His story, next.</p><p>[23:35:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: The Trump administration's policy of rounding up and deporting undocumented immigrants is dividing America, but this next story is really shocking. Eighteen-year-old Francisco Erwin Galicia, a U.S. citizen, born in Dallas, was released just tonight after three weeks behind bars in ICE custody.</p><p>Back on June 27th, Francisco was headed to a college soccer scouting event in North Texas when he was detained even though he had documentation proving that he is a citizen.</p><p>I want to bring in now Claudia Galan. She is Francisco's attorney. Claudia, thank you so much. I really appreciate you joining us. So listen, I got to say --</p><p>CLAUDIA GALAN, ATTORNEY FOR FRANCISCO ERWIN GALICIA: Thank you.</p><p>LEMON: You went to ICE --</p><p>GALAN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>LEMON: Absolutely. You went to ICE detention -- to the ICE detention facility today expecting just -- you were just going to meet with Francisco, and then he was unexpectedly released tonight. You have spoken to him. How is he doing?</p><p>GALAN: Correct. He's doing -- he's really happy to be released now. He's actually on his way to Edinburg, Texas to see his mom, and his mom is really happy that he was released this afternoon when I got there.</p><p>LEMON: How was he treated while he was in custody? What did he tell you about the conditions?</p><p>GALAN: He told me that while he was in border patrol custody, it was the worst conditions. He was in a small room along with other 60 people, only one toilet, no doors, no walls. People were sleeping on the floor.</p><p>[23:40:01] It was extremely cold. He said that he was hungry all the time and that he would just sleep to, you know, forget about being hungry. He lost a lot of weight. And he said that once he was transferred to ICE custody, the conditions were a little bit better, but nevertheless, he wanted to be out of there.</p><p>LEMON: Claudia, is it true that he told you that authorities kept trying to intimidate him?</p><p>GALAN: Yes. When he was in custody with border patrol, they used, you know, scare tactics. They told him that his birth certificate was fake, that he should go back to Mexico. Actually, the intimidation was very extreme that he got to a point where he said, \"OK, I am from Mexico, yes. I guess -- just, you know, deport me.\"</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. So you said they kept telling him his birth certificate was fake?</p><p>GALAN: Correct.</p><p>LEMON: I mean did they try to get to the bottom of this? Why would this take so long to do?</p><p>GALAN: I don't think they were really trying to investigate, you know, and get to the bottom of this. They had since day one an original birth certificate that he was carrying on him. At the time that he was detained, I honestly don't know why they just didn't look into further.</p><p>He had a tourist visa, so when they checked the database, a tourist visa came up on the system. And so because of that conflict of the tourist visa and having a U.S. birth certificate, they kept him longer. Nevertheless, about a week ago, when I went to border patrol headquarters in Edinburg, I turned in a copy of his original birth certificate for border patrol to act.</p><p>And when he was transferred to ICE, his mom got really worried and this is when we decided to take this out to the community and get the help from the community and the media.</p><p>LEMON: OK, so, Claudia, take me back to -- let's go back a bit, to how this all unfolded. Francisco and his brother --</p><p>GALAN: Right.</p><p>LEMON: -- were trying to go to a soccer scouting event when they got caught in the CBP -- in a checkpoint, right?</p><p>GALAN: Correct.</p><p>LEMON: He had documentation.</p><p>GALAN: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: But they still detained him?</p><p>GALAN: Yes, they did.</p><p>LEMON: Why?</p><p>GALAN: Honestly, they just were racial profiling him. He was in a vehicle along with another person who had no status. His brother himself has no status. They just thought that because he had a tourist visa, his birth certificate was not real. They -- he also had his Texas I.D. and a social security card. All of those three documents should be sufficient proof that he is a U.S. citizen.</p><p>LEMON: So, anyone of CBP or ICE, have they acknowledged that Francisco should never have been detained?</p><p>GALAN: They have not. I've only spoken to the deportation, Officer Morales, who was in charge of his case. They did not apologize. They did not acknowledge that it was a mistake. He just said, \"Thank you for your patience.\" I have spoken to border patrol. Attorney Mary Garza did not acknowledge that it was a mistake.</p><p>LEMON: So, his story, Francisco's story was covered by the Dallas Morning news. It gained a ton of traction on social media. How long do you think that he would have been detained if this story hadn't caused such a stir, that it didn't get so much attention?</p><p>GALAN: I mean, I honestly don't have a day. It could be weeks. I mean, he could even get deported. This has happened in the past. So as soon as he was transferred to ICE, given an alien number and placed in removal proceedings, I knew I had to act quick in order to stop his deportation. He's starting 12th grade next month, and I wanted to make sure that he could, you know, go back to school and just go back to his normal life.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. So listen, according to the L.A. Times last year, nearly 1,500 people were released from ICE custody since 2012 after investigating their citizenship claims. Have you heard any other stories like Francisco's where people were wrongfully detained?</p><p>GALAN: Absolutely. I've heard about another story that -- actually he's a San Antonio sit citizen. I believe this was last year. He was deported to Mexico. He came back. While he was in Mexico, he was abducted and then they let him go and he came back to the U.S. I believe that he filed a formal demand against Homeland Security for his wrongful detention in the past, working with other attorneys, filed motions, you know, to terminate proceedings of U.S. citizen. So this has happened in the past.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. Claudia, thank you so much. And listen, he's welcome to come on any time to tell his story. We'd love to hear from him. Thank you so much.</p><p>GALAN: Thank you.</p><p>LEMON: A chill in Silicon Valley tonight as the DOJ launches a formal antitrust review of the nation's biggest tech companies. We'll tell you who is under investigation, next.</p><p>[23:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEMON: The Justice Department is turning its sights on big tech, launching a formal antitrust review of the nation's biggest tech companies amid growing complaints of anti-competitive behavior.</p><p>Matthew Rosenberg is here to discuss, as well as Renato Mariotti.</p><p>Good evening, gents. Thank you so much. The announcement from the DOJ, Matthew, doesn't name names. Who and what are they looking for?</p><p>MATTHEW ROSENBERG, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, look, they are really looking at the big tech companies: Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon --</p><p>LEMON: All the ones.</p><p>ROSENBERG: All the ones. You know their names. We use all their products every day. The question is: What are they looking at? That's a little unclear so far. You know, there are privacy concerns that are broad over how your data is being used, how your information is being used.</p><p>[23:50:00] There are concerns about competition. You look at Facebook's purchase of Instagram or WhatsApp. Those platforms would be markedly different today if they have not been purchased by Facebook. You look at how Google dominates advertising, you know, imposing on fair practices.</p><p>There's such a big range of issues here that we're not quite sure where they are going, but we do know there's a big public (INAUDIBLE) and there's a lot of bipartisan support for this. This is from the right and from the left.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah. Renato, let's bring you in, because the goal of this investigation is to determine whether these companies and their online Platforms have hurt competition, suppress innovation, or otherwise harm consumers. Do you believe they have?</p><p>RENATO MARIOTTI, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, you know, I think there's certainly a legitimate question. I agree that this is something that is an issue on the left and right. I will say I'm a little concerned about the investigation being launched by the Trump administration because we have seen in the past with the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger lot of questionable activity there by the Trump administration. And, you know, this could be used by Trump to potentially go after people who are potentially critical of him. He has been critical of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. He has also obviously had a feud with Amazon and Jeff Bezos.</p><p>So, one concern I have is the Trump administration is generally not aggressive on antitrust. This is an exception to that. It's really an area in which these companies are not engaging in the type of activity that traditionally conservatives will tackle in antitrust. I'm interested in seeing where this goes. I am alarmed despite my concerns about potential activity by some of these companies about whether this will be misused by the Trump administration.</p><p>LEMON: Matthew, I'm wondering why, because you said regardless of rational or political motive, you said that this was a good move for the wrong reasons. Explain that.</p><p>ROSENBERG: I think that's a bit of what Renato was just saying. The Trump administration has not been aggressive in antitrust at all.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah.</p><p>ROSENBERG: Yet the president himself has gone after Amazon. Among kind of the conservative right wing, there is a sense that tech companies are Liberal or dominated by Liberals and that they are in (INAUDIBLE) relation with them. There's idea the tech companies are discounting their followers or taking away Trump followers or somehow burying their messages.</p><p>We have seen no evidence of this, but it's a theory that has come to dominate conservative politics. It has come up in congressional hearings. It has come up with President Trump. And so, you know, there is a fear that this is the reason for this move.</p><p>LEMON: Yeah.</p><p>ROSENBERG: And if that is true, that is the wrong reason.</p><p>LEMON: Wasn't the -- I mean, wasn't the exact opposite, Renato, in 2016 because, you know, other big tech giants -- Facebook and other big tech giants kind of under fire for the -- in the past, as you say, for violations as well as being tools in the 2016 presidential election. Have they been given too much freedom with no accountability, do you think?</p><p>MARIOTTI: I actually do think that some of those platforms don't have enough accountability to public officials. That said, what we saw, Don, in the 2016 election is the incredible influence of Facebook and the abuse of that platform by Russian trolls and kind of Russian intelligence operation meant to influence our election.</p><p>In response to that, Facebook has taken some steps to deal with that, particularly with foreign influence. But, you know, as he just pointed out a moment ago, Trump and his allies believe that Facebook, Twitter, some of these platforms are against them. What I worry about is this is very starting to have an impact on their stocks. I'm worried about him using this as leverage against them.</p><p>LEMON: It's interesting -- similar question. It's interesting that they would say that because Facebook and Twitter, I mean, he uses Twitter every day. Haven't they been instrumental in the success of his campaign and this administration?</p><p>ROSENBERG: I mean, you're right, he uses Twitter every day to great effect. It's a huge communication tool for him. Facebook, you know, during the last campaign, they offered to have people sit in both campaigns, Clinton and Trump campaign, to help them work with advertising and whatever. It's fairly neutral thing.</p><p>The Trump campaign took advantage of that and did incredibly well on Facebook in pushing up messages. So you think, well, you know, (INAUDIBLE), but there is a deep seeded belief among many on the right, they call it shadow banning, that somehow their users, their supporters are being banned and knocked off social media. Their follower accounts are being artificially cut down. Although there's no evidence of it, it's a strong belief. The president has aired that view and many of his allies had as well.</p><p>LEMON: All right. Thank you, Matthew. Thank you, Renato. I appreciate it. CNN's coverage of the former special counsel Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress begins at 8:00 a.m. Don't miss it. Thanks for watching, everyone.

Circuit against the Federal Communication Commission's decision to end net neutrality.</p><p> The latest companies are assembling under a new banner: the Coalition for Internet Openness. Their effort follows other actions by various tech lobbying groups. Back in January, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Google, and Facebook, joined an existing lawsuit against the FCC.</p><p> Now, more tech companies are putting on the pressure. The FCC voted to eliminate net neutrality in December, which allows for internet providers to charge companies and consumers different rates for faster internet access.</p><p> For example, Netflix could have to pay broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon for better access to compete with, say, Hulu. That type of deal frightens tech companies, from tech giants to little startups, since it can jeopardize innovation. And exactly that kind of scenario happened before net neutrality rules were implemented in 2015.</p><p> \"The fight for net neutrality is the fight for civil liberties, and a more vibrant culture. Without it, the free and equal exchange of ideas is at risk,\" Candace Martin, commercial counsel for Kickstarter, said in an emailed statement about the company's lawsuit.</p><p> \"We believe that everyone has the right to access information on places, spaces and people, and that business leaders and brands need to be able to interpret trends and patterns as they truly exist,\" Marc Ellenbogen, general counsel and chief compliance officer for Foursquare, said in an emailed statement.</p><p> Along with tech companies, individual states aren't giving up the fight to preserve net neutrality. States, like Montana, are requiring internet service providers with state contracts to follow net neutrality principles despite federal regulations being eliminated. Some service providers also have pledged to uphold net neutrality.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Net neutrality isn't gone, yet.

Circuit against the Federal Communication Commission's decision to end net neutrality.</p><p><br/>The latest companies are part of the Coalition for Internet Openness. Their effort follows other actions by various tech lobbying groups. Back in January, the Internet Association, which represents Amazon, Google, and Facebook, joined an existing lawsuit against the FCC.<br/> Now, more tech companies are putting on the pressure. The FCC voted to eliminate net neutrality in December, which allows for internet providers to charge companies and consumers different rates for faster internet access.<br/> For example, Netflix could have to pay broadband providers like Comcast and Verizon for better access to compete with, say, Hulu. That type of deal frightens tech companies, from tech giants to little startups, since it can jeopardize innovation. And exactly that kind of scenario happened before net neutrality rules were implemented in 2015.<br/> \"The fight for net neutrality is the fight for civil liberties, and a more vibrant culture. Without it, the free and equal exchange of ideas is at risk,\" Candace Martin, commercial counsel for Kickstarter, said in an emailed statement about the company's lawsuit.<br/> \"We believe that everyone has the right to access information on places, spaces and people, and that business leaders and brands need to be able to interpret trends and patterns as they truly exist,\" Marc Ellenbogen, general counsel and chief compliance officer for Foursquare, said in an emailed statement.<br/> Along with tech companies, individual states aren't giving up the fight to preserve net neutrality. States, like Montana, are requiring internet service providers with state contracts to follow net neutrality principles despite federal regulations being eliminated. Some service providers also have pledged to uphold net neutrality.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10410245</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT9-2051-DYDW-71KT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"348\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 6, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SSTK (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Who is behind it? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, Ivanka Trump's East Wing office, will she take on the duties of the first lady?  We have new details tonight.  And Trump versus Apple, he wants the company to make iPhones in America, but how much more will you pay for an iPhone?  We have the number.  Let's go \"OutFront.\" </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good evening, I'm Erin Burnett.  \"OutFront\" tonight, breaking news, a massive cyber attack, internet giant Yahoo, the American company is a victim of a major security attack.  More than 1 billion accounts hacked.  Yahoo says they believed, \"An unauthorized third party is responsible for stealing user data including names, e-mail addresses, passwords.\"  Yahoo is forcing all of the affected users to change their passwords in validating security questions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jim Sciutto joins me on the join with this breaking news.  I mean, Jim, let's just say this one more time, 1 billion people. </p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Look, the size of this is just staggering, a billion people and keep in mind, it follows a previously Trump released or revealed, rather, a few months, 500 of it, so just staggering.  They're not saying who did it. They're saying that it was a criminal actor.  They haven't identified whether it was a state actor or non-state actor. </p><p>As far as the extent to the information that's been breached, it is names, it is e-mails addresses and passwords, but not financial information.  So no further than that.  But really, the scale of this is just incredible particularly for companies that have been hit before. </p><p>BURNETT:  And you've been talking to sources, you know, when you say criminal actor, I mean, how serious is this, Jim? </p><p>SCIUTTO:  It shows the extent and the power of cyber hacks.  I mean just keep in mind, we're coming out of an election where a state actor, we know Russia had very significant impact or at least expanse of what they were able to reach in the Democratic Party, et cetera. We reported earlier this week that they also broke into Republican Party accounts.  So you see the power of this in a number of domains. </p><p>Here, this is more business domain and a company, one of America's premier technology companies that is now revealed major hacks twice in the span of several months.  And it's just -- it also raises the question for this particular company, did they do enough to protect their account after this half a billion person breach? Clearly, they did not. </p><p>BRUNETT:  Sure, they did not.  All right, Jim Sciutto, thank you. </p><p>And also new tonight, we are learning Ivanka Trump will assume some of the duties normally assigned to the first lady.  A source tells Ivanka will have an office in the East Wing where the current office of the First Lady is located, transition aides calling it the \"Office of the First Family.\" </p><p>This comes as Ivanka and her brothers Don Jr. and Eric today sat in on a meeting between the president-elect and Silicon Valley leaders' billionaire.  As you see Jeff Bezos was there, Tim Cook from Apple, Sheryl Sandberg sitting next to Mike Pence from Facebook. </p><p>The presence of the Trump children at that meeting further blurring, already incredibly blurred the lines between their duties as the people who are suppose to manage Trump's business empire and have nothing to do with the government and a role in the White House. </p><p>Don Jr. tonight tweeting about his involvement in the tech meeting, \"Honored to have sat in on this meeting, the most impressive group of minds I've seen assembled all looking to fight for America and U.S. jobs.\"  CNN has learned that Don Jr. also an avid hunter was heavily involved in the selection process for Secretary of the Interior playing a big role in picking that nominee, Montana Representative Ryan Zinke. </p><p>Jeff Zeleny begins our coverage tonight.  And, Jeff, you know, there are laws against this, but this truly is a family affair. </p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  A family affair indeed, Erin.  And Ivanka Trump's office likely in the East Wing of the White House where the First Lady has work is the sure sign that she will be a central part of the Trump White House. </p><p>Now, of course, the Trump children have always had a seat at their father's table at Trump Tower.  It appears that will continue when he moves to the White House. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ZELENY:  Donald Trump has made clear his sons will oversee the old family business while he's in the White House.  But they are also playing a key role setting up the new family business helping select the Trump cabinet. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT:  I think it's going to be one of the great cabinets ever, ever, ever. </p><p>ZELENY:  The latest example, the Interior Department.  Donald Trump Jr. interviewed candidates and CNN has learned persuaded his father to tap Ryan Zinke, a Montana congressman and former Navy SEAL as Interior Secretary.  It's a position Trump's oldest child once eyed for himself. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP.JR., SON OF DONALD TRUMP:  Our big insight joke over Thanksgiving and Christmas now that these things become very real with the presidencies.  You know, \"Hey, Don, the only thing you'd be doing in government is actually interior.\"  So I don't know if I would be the head of it or just informing them. </p><p>ZELENY:  Whether it's a conflict of interest or simply becoming the new normal in Washington, the lines between some real estate empire and government are blurring.  His other son, Eric Trump, said in on at least one interview for Secretary of State. </p><p>[19:05:03] Shortly after the election, his daughter Ivanka Trump drew fire for attending a meeting with her father and the Japanese Prime Minister.  Today, all three children sat in on their father's meeting with high-tech executives. </p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to be not only great, we're going to be greater than ever before. </p><p>ZELENY:  CNN has learned the office of First Lady will become the office of first family after Trump becomes president.  His adviser say Trump's children have always had a seat at the table and will continue too in the Oval Office. </p><p>SEAN SPICER:  RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR:  Bottom line is that he's been very clear from day one with his family -- with the role of his family plays and the trust that he has in them in terms of how to guide decisions. </p><p>ZELENY:  Donald Trump Jr. who's long been an avid outdoors man has expressed his vision for Interior Secretary. </p><p>TRUMP JR.:  He assures that under a Trump residency, I'm going to have his ear, my brother, Eric, is going to have his ear.  We're hunters. We're reloaders.  We're competitive shooters.  This is what we do.  We live the lifestyle. </p><p>ZELENY:  But far more than a love of hunting, the Interior Department also has a direct connection to Trump's businesses, including the new Trump hotel in Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ZELENY:  Now, the Trump family relieve it -- received a tax break of more than $30 million to restore that old post office, which is still own by the federal government and leased by the Trumps.  That program is run by the National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department. And, Erin, that's where the questions of potential conflict lie.  When Donald Trump Jr. who will run the Trump Real Estate Empire is also helping pick cabinet secretaries, it's clear the wall between the family business and the presidency are not so clearly defined. </p><p>BURNETT:  Yup, all right.  Thank you very much Jeff. </p><p>And \"OutFront\" now, Mark Preston, our Executive Political Editor, Jackie Kucinich, the Washington Bureau Chief for \"The Daily Beast,\" Jamie Gangel, Special Correspondent and Criminal Defense Attorney, former Prosecutor Paul Callan. </p><p>Mark, so let's start with this issue.  I want to get to the hotel in a moment, but Don Jr., sitting in on a meeting today, tweeting about the meeting with the tech CEOs, the interviewing and vetting a cabinet nominee.  This is Trump's son who Trump this week said on Twitter would be the one running the Trump businesses. </p><p>MARK PRESTON, CNN POLITICS EXECUTIVE EDITOR:  Right.  Not until next month, though.  Not until next month when they hold the news conference.  For me having his family involved in providing guidance, analysis, whatever it maybe isn't an issue.  The idea, though, that they are running his empire and that they're helping make you decisions, that is the issue. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE DAILY BEAST\":  Right, if the two things simultaneously. </p><p>PRESTON:  Correct.  That is the big issue.  Presidents have always relied on their family for some kind of counsel, but this is a little too close for comfort. </p><p>KUCINICH:  You'll never be able to restore lines if you basically -- you have a water color going into this.  It doesn't just like start over the day that the presidency starts.  There is -- I mean, those pictures of the kids sitting ... </p><p>BURNETT:  Right.  It's going to change in a few weeks is not going to fly (ph). </p><p>KUCINICH:  Well, exactly, especially because these advisers, these tech CEOs, they were sitting -- they see the children sitting there. That's a message ... </p><p>PRESTON:  Right. </p><p>KUCINICH:  ... that, you know, if you're sitting down with Don Jr., you're also very - you're very much aligned with the president. </p><p>BURNETT:  A family affair, Jamie, because as I mentioned at the top of the show, we are reporting Trump will name the traditional office of the First Lady, the office of the first family.  There are laws, nepotism laws in this country that prevent a president from formally hiring his family. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT:  Right. </p><p>BURNETT:  Naming the office the office of the first family if you don't formally hire them would appear to go clearly against the spirit of that law. </p><p>GANGEL:  It may go against it, but I think as we've seen over and over again, welcome to the world of Donald Trump. </p><p>BURNETT:  Yeah. </p><p>GANGEL:  And it may actually be a very clever way of getting around it because if it's a family role, it's a family role.  The other thing I just want to point out is Eric Trump was also in the meeting for Secretary of State when Mitt Romney went to meet. </p><p>BURNETT:  Right. </p><p>GANGEL:  So this is a repeated thing over and over again.  If this is a firewall we're seeing, it's an invisible firewall because they are there every step of the way. </p><p>BURNETT:  So, Paul, on the Trump hotel, right, which Jeff Zeleny has mentioned is overseen by the Interior Department.  Don Jr. is going to be the one ostensibly running that hotel.  He's the one who was in the meeting picking the Secretary of Interior. </p><p>There are already foreign governments using that hotel to impress Trump posting (inaudible) expensive fancy holiday parties there in just a past few weeks.  If you were advising Trump what would you tell him to do?  Get rid of that hotel altogether or not? </p><p>PAUL CALLAN, FORMER PROSECUTOR:  Well, I'll tell what a tough job it is for a lawyer advising Donald Trump, because he's got his own opinions about the law and about this kind of advice.  But my advice would be wall yourself off specifically from pieces of business that have interaction with foreign countries.  And a hotel is a classic example. </p><p>For instance, at the hotel there's a suite that supposedly rents for 20 grand a night.  Now let say the Soviet Union decides, \"We're going to book that thing for a year while we negotiate treaties with the United States,\" obviously, that would subject him to enormous political criticism. But he might in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the constitution. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CALLAN:  Yes, yes. </p><p>BURNETT:  I know, but if ... </p><p>CALLAN:  Does that file (ph) like the constitution?  It might very well and subject Trump to impeachment.  So I'd be really careful about that if I were giving advice to the president. [19:10:02] PRESTON:  You know what I think, one of the biggest problems is, is that the oversight is supposed to come from Congress and Congress is now being led by Republicans in both chambers.  Now, I'm not saying that they are not going to do their job, but there's going to be an incredible amount of pressure on House Republicans and Senate Republicans who oversee the committees, who have the oversight, who have the ability for subpoena power to make sure that Donald Trump or his kids aren't crossing the line. </p><p>And let's give him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't cross the line, but the fact of the matter is there needs to be a watchdog on this and right now I don't know if Congress is that watchdog. </p><p>BURNETT:  And which, of course, Jackie has a huge issue here, because there's no sign, you know, that anything is going to change as you make the point.  So those tech CEOs, they saw who was in that room today. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Right. </p><p>BURNETT:  They saw who was there.  That was a very strong message. These people matter and Trump even went so far as to say there's no hierarchy here.  Call me, call anyone, right, as if, you know, call one, call all. </p><p>KUCINICH:  Yeah, exactly. </p><p>BURNETT:  Yeah. </p><p>KUCINICH:  You know and that -- that's a problem.  But I would disagree with you a little bit, because it's not like they're all in lock step right now when it comes to Trump and Russia.  They're pushing forward Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Bob Corker are pushing forward with an investigation into this hacking. I'm not conflating the two, but I'm saying that there are things that they think Congress will take and run with whether -- and if this gets bad enough to your point ... </p><p>BURNETT:  Then they would. </p><p>KUCINICH:  ... then they would, because then their jobs get on the line and let's be honest there.  Everyone is a self-preservationalist (ph) ... </p><p>BURNETT:  Jamie, you mentioned Eric Trump being in the meeting -- one of the meetings with Mitt Romney.  You have some new reporting on exactly what happen there, why Mitt Romney did not get picked by Donald Trump and the reporting is that the Trump didn't even look at him seriously.  You're saying he did. </p><p>GANGEL:  We are told that he absolutely looked at him seriously and I think there were three things.  The first thing we've learned is that Trump would have liked an apology for Romney to say he was wrong, not immediately. </p><p>He didn't say that at the beginning, but after Kellyanne Conway and other members of his close advisors came out blistering, Trump said to Romney, \"You know, could you please apologize?  You need to nullify.\" Not only did Trump, but Reince Priebus, who was a big fan of Mitt Romney's did it and Mike Pence. </p><p>BURNETT:  That's interesting. </p><p>GANGEL:  Mitt Romney declined to do that.  That said, I think one of the most interesting things we've learned is the two men got along very, very well and Trump told people, much to his surprise, I really like him.  So by all accounts this was serious. </p><p>BURNETT:  But not enough. </p><p>GANGEL:  Not enough. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURNETT:  Not enough. </p><p>GANGEL:  Not enough. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURNETT:  ... book this week. </p><p>GANGEL:  And where (ph) she was the big issue. </p><p>BURNETT:  Yeah. </p><p>GANGEL:  They had two different world views and Rex Tillerson solved that, you know, problem for him. </p><p>BURNETT:  All right.  Thanks to all. </p><p>And next, Trump wants Apple to bring back American jobs.  So he's been really aggressive about this.  So here's the thing, we did the math, if your iPhone was made in America, how much more would it cost? We're going to give you the number.  Would you pay it? </p><p>Plus, college officials warning immigrant student, \"If you traveled get back to the United States before Trump is president.\"  Real fear or complete fear mongering?  And remember America's dad, Alan Thicke? </p><p>ALAN THICKE, ACTOR:  Dan, what are you doing? </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Walking Carol flirt with some guy and he is not Bobby. </p><p>THICKE:  Well, that's none of your business with the guy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[19:15:57] BURNETT:  Tonight, Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires face to face with Donald Trump, the president-elect reaching out to big tech company CEOs. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting.  And I will say Peter research saying (ph), no, that company is too small and he's a monster company, there's nobody like you in the world, in the world.  There's nobody like the people in this room and anything we can do to help this go along and we're going to do that for you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURNETT:  The meeting included, you saw some of their faces there, leaders from Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, a company that Trump has slammed during the campaign.  Dan Simon is \"OutFront.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Apple, Apple, Apple, boycott Apple. </p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It was one of candidate Trump's main targets on the campaign trail. </p><p>TRUMP:  Boycott Apple until they do it.  Boycott them, who cares. </p><p>SIMON:  First, blasting the company for refusing to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. </p><p>TRUMP:  Give me a break, why wouldn't they want to do it? </p><p>SIMON:  Trump then turns his sides to Apple's overseas manufacturing saying this at nearly every campaign rally. </p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to have Apple building their product in the United States, not in China and Vietnam and all over. </p><p>And believe me, if I'm president that's going to happen. </p><p>SIMON:  But analysts called that highly unlikely.  For starters, consumers would probably have to pay a lot more for their next iPhone. Estimates vary, but perhaps double the amount.  An iPhone 7 starting at $650 could go for $1,300 or more. </p><p>Apple's top manufacturer is the Taiwanese firm Foxconn with factories all over China.  Workers get paid roughly $400 a month to assemble iPhones, but in the U.S. workers would make a minimum of nearly $1,000 a month, at least double the wages of a Chinese laborer, costs that could be absorbed by consumers. </p><p>TIM BARAJIN, ANALYST:  That price of an iPhone or whatever it is would go up exponentially. </p><p>SIMON:  And technology analyst Tim Barajin says any job gains would be eroded over time with robots, not people building the phones. </p><p>BARAJIN:  I would argue that any job that has a lot of repetitive tasks is going to move to robotics over the next 10 years. SIMON:  Apple designs its products in the U.S., but herein says at least 80 percent of its raw supplies also come from overseas, which makes building an iPhone in America seem even more impractical. </p><p>TRUMP:  When they Apple, it's not wonderful, but they make everything outside. </p><p>SIMON:  While Trump recently told \"Time Magazine\" that he challenged Apple to build its biggest plant yet in the U.S. instead of China, the company points out its technology is directly responsible for widespread job creation in the U.S. from its engineers and retail employees to app developers. </p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO:  We've created 1.9 million jobs now in the United States and we have tens of millions of customers who use our products. We work for them and we love deeply our country. </p><p>SIMON:  But Trump's criticism may be having an impact.  Foxconn says it's now on talks to expand it's presence in the U.S. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[19:20:08] SIMON:  Well, the bottom line is an iPhone made in America is probably a campaign pledge that Donald Trump will not be able to fulfill.  That said, Foxconn did tell CNN that it isn't preliminary discussions to expand its operation in the U.S. but no timetable when something like that would happen. </p><p>Erin, Apple once again reiterating that it is responsible for 2 million jobs in the U.S., some of them work in this retail shop behind me, which I'm told is pretty busy this time of year.  Erin? </p><p>BURNETT:  A lot of retial jobs.  All right, thank you very much, Dan Simon.  I mean, that's pretty excellent reporting.  You go down, you get the bottom line here of what the reality is.  Would you pay double? </p><p>\"OutFront\" now, President of the Economic Future Group, Jonathan Tasini and Senior Policy Analyst of the Heritage Foundation, Salim Furth. </p><p>So, Jonathan, let me start with you.  You saw Dan Simon's report. Would people just on this bottom line issue, $650, now $1,350 or more possibly later, could people really pay that much?  Would they be willing to pay that much for made in America? </p><p>JONATHAN TASINI, PRESIDENT, ECONOMIC FUTURE GROUP:  Well, let separate could be and would they be willing.  In some -- in a certain way the iPhone is not a good example of manufacture in America and what people would pay because it's such a luxury, almost a mythical item and I've got one here and as you know people line up for days sometimes for the newest iPhone. </p><p>So I suspect, perhaps, in the beginning there might be some sticker shock, but people eventually would buy the product.  The more important thing to me is, what are the wages the people are going to be paid to actually manufacture in the United States those items. </p><p>BURNETT:  But you think that because it is a prestige and luxury item, people would pick. </p><p>TASINI:  I suspect ... </p><p>BURNETT:  (Inaudible) they could pay that.  They could do a whole ad campaign, made in America.  There's an iPhone. </p><p>TASINI:  I think that the made in America campaign you're paying here. And I will say that I did -- as focus groups some years ago about people shopping at Walmart, not the same kind of level of prices, but people said if they knew that people are getting higher healthcare and better wages that they would be willing to pay more at Walmart.  I think the same, although at a higher price, would be true about the iPhone. </p><p>BURNETT:  All right, Salim, what do you say, $1,350 or possibly more for an iPhone. </p><p>SALIM FURTH, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  I think if Apple thought that they could make more money selling iPhones for 1,300 bucks, they'd be doing it right now.  And so I trust the Apple to understand its way to make new profit and, you know, the rumor or potential talks that Foxconn is going to move some of its operations to the U.S., that's great. </p><p>But if they're doing that, that's not a publicity stunt.  They're doing that because they see a way to make money using American expertise, American workers who are terrific and American capital investment and we need to make a business environment that attracts that kind of investment that makes sense from a bottom line perspective. </p><p>TASINI:  Well, let's understand this.  Workers in China and workers in the United States are equally skilled.  The difference here is wages. In China and in other countries, we're looking at the reason that Apple is over there, other countries are over there, it's because they're playing slave wages.  The difference is not about skill, I think that's almost the racist nationalist thing to say that we have better workers here.  It's about wages.  This is about profit. </p><p>BURNETT:  So let me just interject here.  And first of all, I want all of you to tweet us.  Let us know would you pay 1,350 for an iPhone. But that issue, Tim Cook says you're wrong.  He says no, this is all about skills.  They have the skills in China, not here.  He was on \"60 Minutes\" last year and he answer the question.  Here's how he put it, Jonathan. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>COOK:  China put an enormous focus on manufacturing in what we would call -- you and I would call vocational kind of skills.  I mean you could take every tool and dye maker in United States and probably put them in the room they were currently sitting in.  In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ERIN:  You say rubbish. </p><p>TASINI:  It's rubbish.  I mean people -- there are plenty of good skilled workers here, plenty of good skilled workers in China.  The issue is wages.  The reason Apple is in China is because they are profiting, because they're essentially using slave labor. </p><p>And there are plenty of good people here both who lost jobs before who are -- who worked assembly line jobs in industrial America, plenty of people to be trained for this.  This is not such highly skilled work, particularly assembly of this iPhone (ph). </p><p>ERIN:  So, Salim, what do you say?  I mean as Tim Cook write, he's saying its skills, but Jonathan has a point, right?  I mean, you just saw the numbers in the piece.  $400 a month is what you pay a work in China to put an iPhone together.  It would be $1,000 in the United States.  It would seem this is about numbers, not about skills. </p><p>FURTH:  Right.  So manufacturing in the U.S. has some other advantages that tend to offset those wage costs.  For instance, your less shipping cost, you're not dealing with multiple regulatory regimes. So, yeah, American workers are going to make more.  They are closer to the market.  They have better outside options. </p><p>Chinese workers, they maybe making very low wages, but when the alternative is to go back to a rural village with no jobs, they're willing to take those jobs.  I know these allegations of slave labor, but the evidence is that a great many rural Chinese have moved to the cities very willingly to take these industrial level jobs that are similar to what our grandparents worked in the United States. </p><p>TASINI:  Well, as Jesse Jackson who used to say even slaves had jobs. And those folks who are moving from rural China, yes, they were in deep poverty.  They have no choice and some of them are living in just awful conditions. </p><p>[19:25:03] BURNETT:  All right.  Well, thank you both very much.  I appreciate your time tonight.  And, again, please vote us to know, would you pay 1,350 for an iPhone?  It's a crucial question for Donald Trump. </p><p>\"OutFront\" next, colleges across the country warning immigrant students that if you leave the United States, get back before Trump is inaugurated or you might not be allowed back it.  Is this crossing the line?  And Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner house hunting in Georgetown.  So, where could they be moving?  We went to look.  Did you know Jackie Kennedy's old home is on the market? </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BURNETT:  Warning tonight to students who are undocumented immigrants. If you are traveling outside the United States, come back before President-elect Trump is inaugurated.  Now, that is coming from California State University.  We're hearing similar messages from officials at the University of California campuses.  It's pretty stunning, but it's happening. </p><p>Kyung Lah is \"OutFront\" live in Los Angeles tonight.  And, Kyung, I mean, this is incredible to hear.  What are university officials actually saying? </p><p>KYUNG LAH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  What we're talking about here is the letter from Cal State's Chancellor, the office of the chancellor, a letter that was sent to the faculty of all 23 campuses and a letter to assesses what to do about Dhaka students, the so- called dreamers and what happens after the inauguration. </p><p>Students who are traveling overseas writes the chancellor should, \"Stay foot.\"  Basically return and stay foot in the United States.  We want to take a look at one segment of this letter quote, he writes, \"Immediately inform your students who are already abroad that unless they return by January 19th there is no assurance they will be allowed to return to the U.S. and there is a realistic possibility that they will be denied re-entry.\" </p><p>[19:30:05] The statement coming because of all of the rhetoric we heard from the president-elect during the campaign trail and what the letter further explains, Erin, is you have to be prepared about what happens after inauguration.  How many students are we talking about, Erin?  We are talking about only a handful according to Cal State, perhaps ten.  But the issue is what they are trying to drive at, what to do about these students who are in flux, Erin?   </p><p>BURNETT:  So what's been the reaction, Kyung?   </p><p>LAH:  Oh, this is such a highly emotional issue, especially here in California.  Where you have a high population of immigrant students at these campus, Latinos and Asians.  We spoke with one UCLA student, a UCLA student speaking with one of our affiliates.  And she says, basically, what they are feeling is uncertainty and fear.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>NICOLE CORONA, UCLA STUDENT:  I was just 3 years old.  It's not -- I didn't have a voice and I've grown up here.  I've grown up reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  And just the idea of being vulnerable to deportations is crazy, because there is nothing for me to go back to. This is my home now and I have as much of a right to be here as my peers.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LAH:  And the last word we heard from the president-elect was an interview we did with \"TIME\" magazine.  And in that interview, while he would not back down on ending President Obama's executive orders on immigration he did say he would, quote, \"work something out\" in regards to these DACA students.  </p><p>We should point out, Erin, that the people who supported Mr. Trump and voted for him,  many of them still do consider these DACA students illegal, even though they came across with their parents -- Erin.   </p><p>BURNETT:  All right.  Kyung, thank you very much. </p><p>OUTFRONT now, Ben Ferguson, conservative radio show host and Keith Boykin, former aide in the Clinton White House.   </p><p>So, Ben, look, you just heard what Kyung said.  Trump has called President Obama's executive actions on immigration illegal.  He actually was very clear about this on the campaign trail.  Let me play what he said.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT-ELECT:  We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants, 5 million.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURNETT:  So, he had said we would terminate the executive action. So, what is the bottom line here?  The chancellor and the university's justified fear?  Or fear mongering?   </p><p>BEN FERGUSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  No, this is fear mongering in the most sad and I think sick form, because you actually have students that may believe genuinely that January 20th they are not going to be allowed back into the country.  One it would be virtually impossible for that to take effect on the same day even if that was something he wanted them to do. </p><p>But Donald Trump is also been clear that if you came to this country and you are very young, specifically these students under this category DACA, that he's going look at how to have some sort of compromise.  There's been no indication from Donald Trump that he would go after and punish people that came here at a very young age against their will and have no say so, or these students.   </p><p>But to put it out there that if you don't back to the United States of America by January 19th, at midnight, that somehow you are going to be left out of this country and never get back in.  It's absolutely fearmongering and it's sick and it's sad and it's perverted that they are using this for political gain for their messaging.   </p><p>BURNETT:  Keith? </p><p>KEITH BOYKIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  I'm sorry.  I thought it was fear mongering when the president-elect of the United States of America went all across the country during his campaign saying he was going to deport people and create a deportation force.  I thought it was fearmongering --  </p><p>FERGUSON:  There are people who are going to be deported.   </p><p>BOYKIN:  -- when the president elect said he was going repeal President  Obama's policies on the immigration form.  I thought it was fearmongering when the president-elect said all these policies were illegal.  But somehow, the University of California --  FERGUSON:  Some of them are. </p><p>BOYKIN:  -- because they are articulating a concern, a valid concern that they should be careful not to be out of the country, that they are fearmongering and not the president-elect of the United States --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)   </p><p>BOYKIN:  It seems to be an absurd assertion.   </p><p>BURNETT:  So, let me just, Keith, you know, he said the things he said in those rallies.  OK.  Ben.  He did.  But in an interview with \"TIME\" magazine, last week.  So this is after he won the White House.  He said something very specific.   </p><p>FERGUSON:  Made it very clear.   </p><p>BURNETT:  OK, Keith, let me move it to you.  He said, \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.\"  He's talking about the DACA students, these DREAMers, these college kids. \"They got brought here at the very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here, some were good students, some have wonderful jobs and they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.   </p><p>Keith, is that enough that these, Cal State, California campuses should have seen this and said wait a minute we shouldn't have put that warning out there?   </p><p>BOYKIN:  Absolutely not.  I mean, this is the problem with Donald Trump, not just on the issue of DACA, but on every other issue, in healthcare reform, issues that deal with ISIS, and other foreign policy issues.   </p><p>[19:35:09] There is no specificity to anything he says.  So he goes out and give these campaign speeches and gets everybody riled up but he doesn't offer --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOYKIN:  He's like his healthcare plan.  It's terrific care.  There is no specificity, Ben.  And even tries --   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BOYKIN:  -- on lack of information that Donald Trump providing --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURNETT:  So, Ben, what does it mean and what is specific here, because he did explain they worked hard in coming here et cetera, et cetera.  But his solution was we're going to show something that makes people happy and proud.  What's the specific in this? </p><p>FERGUSON:  His specific point is, there is going to be a compromise here and when he becomes the president he's sworn in on January 20th, he's going work on some sort of compromise.   </p><p>BOYKIN:  Some sort of compromise.   </p><p>FERGUSON:  Let me finish what I'm going to say about this that students that have been here, that came here at a young age.  We're going to work on a compromise for them.  I'm in favor of that compromise.   </p><p>There are some people here illegally that should be deported.  He's made that clear.  That is not talking about these students that are under DACA.   </p><p>For the presidents and universities to go out there after he did this interview with \"TIME\" magazine and said these students are somebody who shouldn't have to live in never land --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FERGUSON:  I'm not filibustering.  I'm stating what Donald Trump --  </p><p>BOYKIN:  OK.   </p><p>FERGUSON:  Way too far.   </p><p>BURNETT:  Go ahead, Keith.   </p><p>BOYKIN:  At some point I issue you would accept the idea that Donald Trump is at least partially responsible for the rhetoric and climate he's created.  And not always assume that rhetoric is at fault.   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURNETT:  Let him finish. </p><p>BOYKIN:  You are always assuming the person responding to the rhetoric is at fault.  But there is one person who is in charge here, who is creating the climate and that's Donald Trump.  Let's hold him accountable.  Let's ask for specificity.  Don't give him a blank check to do whatever.   </p><p>He should at this point, 35 days before he becomes president, he should have some idea of what he's going to do and you and I have no idea what that is.  That is a problem.  And there are 740,000 people out there who are DREAMers, who are concerned. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BURNETT:  Isn't it true that he hasn't been clear on exactly what that is?  He did say he's going to repeal all these things.  Now, he's saying I want to make people happy and proud.  But wouldn't it be incumbent on him to be a little more clear?   </p><p>FERGUSON:  I think that is exactly what he was doing in \"TIME\" magazine and hen he specifically talks about DACA students and specifically says that we're going to make people happy, it is at that point --  BOYKIN:  Happy is not a policy.   </p><p>FERGUSON:  When he's talk about the happy I'm pretty sure we can be intellectually honest enough that means some sort of compromise here.   </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FERGUSON:  You just don't like Donald Trump in general and you don't like what he says in general, but I'll finish my point by saying this. When Donald Trump says that in \"TIME\" magazine it is irresponsible for presidents of universities for their own political reasons to terrify students that are under that category in their university system --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BURNETT:  We hit pause there for tonight.  Thank you both.   </p><p>Next, did this woman singlehandedly crush Trump's stock market rally?   </p><p>And the billionaires of Trump's cabinet house-hunting in D.C.  We're going to take you to the new billionaires row. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[19:42:05] BURNETT:  Interest rates going up for just the second time in a decade, in a decade.  The Fed announcing that constitutional rights will go up.  A quarter of a point but it effects all of us. And when the chief of the Fed actually took questions today, they weren't not about.  That they were almost all about a man who repeatedly attacked her on the campaign trail, Donald Trump.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JANET YELLEN, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIR:  I'm not going to offer the incoming president advice about how to conduct himself in policy.  I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURNETT:  Phil Mattingly is OUTFRONT. </p><p>And, Phil, Janet Yellen, the chief of the Fed, was a frequent target of the president-elect during the campaign.  It was almost all she was asked about today.  It would be an understatement to say he's not a fan of hers.   </p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, an understatement is never a great strategy when you're talking about the president-elect.  Look, it is normal in an election, in a campaign, in the White House that you don't talk about the Federal Reserve.  They are supposed to be a very defined wall there.  You can't get Josh Earnest or President Obama ever to weigh in.   </p><p>That's not necessarily the case with Donald Trump.  Take a listen to him on the campaign trail.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS) </p><p>TRUMP:  This Janet Yellen of the Fed.  The Fed is doing political. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.   </p><p>Janet Yellen should have raised the rates.  She's not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn't want her to.   </p><p>I think she's very political and to a certain extent I think she should be ashamed of herself.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS) </p><p>MATTINGLY:  Now, Erin, the interesting element here is be careful what you wish for.  It's easier to talk when you're not sitting in the White House about the need to raise rates.  Well, those rates are now going up and as you noted that could be problems for Donald Trump's economy.   </p><p>And you look at the Fed minutes today what exactly came out.  And they are talking about raising rates at an increased level than they originally were, as many as three times next year.  That could restrict growth, restrict kind of where kind of Donald Trump wants this economy to be.   </p><p>And it's worth noting as well, when you look at the president-elect's economic plans, and this is important, a major tax cut, a major stimulus coming from a major infrastructure plan.  Those are the types of things that spark inflation concerns.  Inflation concerns in and of themselves, obviously, as you know well, Erin, those cause rate increases as well.  Donald Trump said a lot of things about Janet Yellen.  She may have the power do a lot of things next year that he doesn't appreciate very much.   </p><p>BURNETT:  That's for sure.  All right.  Thank you very much, Phil. </p><p>And OUTFRONT now, the president of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco, who knows this better than anyone. </p><p>Jim, you hear Donald Trump talked about Janet Yellen with words like she is not a Republican.  When her time is up, I would most likely replace, criticized her aggressively.  There is supposed to be this wall.   </p><p>Is there any concern that he has said these things, that he may try to influence the Fed or that the Fed could try to seek revenge on Donald Trump? </p><p>JIM BIANCO, PRESIDENT, BIANCO RESEARCH:  Well, yes, you are right. That the historical rules of that you don't criticize the Fed have been thrown out the window right now.  He is criticizing the Fed.  The belief on Wall Street is when Janet Yellen's term ends in January of 2018, we'll have another federal reserve chairman.  It won't be her. And we can debate about who it might be.   </p><p>But there are going to be big changes at the Federal Reserve over the next year to 18 months.   BURNETT:  In the meantime, obviously, raising interest rates, as Phil was explaining.  Right, it costs everybody more money and that can hurt an economy.  Trump is incredibly proud of his stock market rally, right?  Incredibly proud.  Stocks had their worst day today in two months, because of Janet Yellen, because of the Fed rate hike.  She sort of slaid his rally. </p><p>He, though, is still boasting about it.  He is proud of it.  Here he is. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We're doing well right now.  And I'm very honored by the bounce.  They are talking about the bounce.  So, right now, everybody in the room has to like me at least a little bit.  But we're going to try and have that bounce continue.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURNETT:  That was this afternoon.  Obviously, stocks were doing the exact opposite.  But he was talking about people in that room.  You know, Goldman Sachs in that room.  Their stocks up 30 percent since Donald Trump, he is a big part of the reason for that. </p><p>Did she just kill the rally?   </p><p>BIANCO:  You know, it is the opening question.  Basically interest rates won out and they can go up for one of two reasons.  They can go up because of real growth, real economic growth is getting better and that would be a very good thing for the stock market and for the economy.  Or they can go up because there is a fear that inflation is coming back.   </p><p>Now put it in a different way, the Trump rally has always been called the reflation rally.  But what are we reflating?  Up until a couple of days ago, we were thinking we were reflating the real economy.  But now, Wall Street and the markets are starting to worry we're reflating inflation.   </p><p>And if that's what we're doing, then it won't be taken well by the stock market.  And maybe today was one of the first salvos, and in creating inflation, we're not creating real growth.  And that's what the question we're going to grapple with in 2017. </p><p>BURNETT:  And what's your bottom line, your point of view?  Tax cuts that he's talked about, a trillion dollars in infrastructure, real growth or not? </p><p>BIANCO:  Well, in and of itself, I think the tax cuts and stimulus can be a good thing.  But the devil is always in the details.  If it winds up to be this politically motivated we're going take care of the people we take care of and do a bunch of the projects that don't really help the economy, it is not going to help.  But if we do the things that we need to do as far as infrastructure spending and about things that will help promote growth, it can help.  So, it's more than just a trillion dollars, what trillion dollars are going to do with it? </p><p>BURNETT:  All right.  Thank you very much, Jim Bianco. </p><p>And next, a nearly $12 million condo is said to be the most expensive in Washington D.C.  Look inside, you will go there.  Could it be Ivanka Trump's new home?   </p><p>And Jeanne Moos on Alan Thicke, the beloved comedian who became America's dad.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ALAN THICKE:  I'm Jason Seaver.  This is my house.  This is Seavers house.  Hey, Ben, you're grounded.   </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[19:51:05] BURNETT:  New tonight, a source tells CNN, Ivanka Trump will have an office in the White House.  This comes as she and her husband Jared Kushner go house hunting in Washington.  Will they end up in billionaires' row? </p><p>Sunlen Serfaty is OUTFRONT. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SUNLEN SERFATY, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With the incoming administration, the nation's capital is getting a boost of new glitzy, glamorous and mega rich residents, each now on the hunt for a premier Washington address.   </p><p>Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are preparing to move to D.C. with their three young children.  Sources tell CNN this past Sunday, they were out house shopping in their ritzy northwest neighborhood of Georgetown.   </p><p>IVANKA TRUMP, DAUGHTER OF DONALD TRUMP:  I'm incredibly proud to play a small role in debunking this caricature of what a working woman looks likes.   </p><p>SERFATY:  They could go the iconic route, snatching up one of the hottest in D.C.  Jackie Kennedy Onassis' former six-bedroom, 5.5 bathroom mansion, with a price tag of $9 million.  Or just blocks away something more in line with the Manhattan apartment they live in now. This sprawling penthouse condo at the Ritz Carlton Residences, clocking in as the most expensive condo on the market in Washington at nearly $12 million.   </p><p>But D.C.'s new power couple aren't the only well heeled headed to Washington in the market for a new home.   </p><p>CHRISTIE-ANNE WEISS, VICE PRESIDENT, TTR SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL REALTY:  We know there are new cabinet members searching for real estate already and they are out and about.   SERFATY:  Since election day, high end luxury real estate agents say the top echelon of their business is booming at a level not seen during the previous changes of the guards between administrations, due to the striking amount of the deep-pocketed future White House officials flooding Washington.  Trump's cabinet picks forming a long line of multimillionaires and billionaires, all ready to fork over big bucks and putting a priority on opulence. </p><p>CHRISTOPHER RITZERT, VICE PRESIDENT, TTR SOTHEBY'S INTERNATIONAL REALITY:  The first people who have arrived for expressed strong preference for luxury properties in turnkey condition and in excellent locations.  Close in.   </p><p>SERFATY:  Among those close neighborhoods that fits the bill, the northwest neighborhood of Kalorama, where the Obamas will be renting their post-White House home.  The storied Watergate Hotel, home of some of the luminaries of administrations past.   </p><p>And the Massachusetts Heights neighborhood, which boosts the most expensive home for sale right now in D.C., a lavish $20 million estate.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SERFATY:  And that's the new neighborhood of at least one incoming official, President-elect Donald Trump's commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross, according to \"The Washington Post\", just purchasing a $12 million property just a few doors away -- Erin.   </p><p>BURNETT:  All right.  Thank you very much, Sunlen.  Pretty incredible to imagine. </p><p>OUTFRONT next, Jeanne Moos looks at the life of one of America's favorite TV fathers, Alan Thicke. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[19:57:43] BURNETT:  Alan Thicke of \"Growing Pains\", one of America's most loved TV dads.  Here is Jeanne Moos.   </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Sixty-nine-year-old Alan Thicke had a heart attack, doing something he loved.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Look at all the hockey shoes you have.   </p><p>ALAN THICKE, ACTOR:  You don't say hockey shoes ever to a Canadian. These are skates.   </p><p>MOOS:  He was playing hockey with his 19-year-old son Carter when he felt nauseas and had chest pains. </p><p>\"Today, I lost my best friend and my idol, and the world lost one of its finest\", tweeted Carter.   </p><p>His most famous son, Robin, didn't blur these lines, writing, \"He was the best man I ever knew.\" </p><p>Thicke was best known for the '80s sitcom \"Growing Pains.\"   </p><p>THICKE:  Well, it's fine with me because this girl is killing me. </p><p>MOOS:  He played a gender-bending role as a stay at home psychiatrist and idealized dad.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I didn't do the stupid drug.   </p><p>MOOS:  The sitcom occasionally covered serious topics like cocaine use.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thanks dad.   </p><p>MOOS:  The show launched other stars like Leonardo DiCaprio.   </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You don't trust doctors anymore than I do.   </p><p>MOOS:  And lasted seven years. </p><p>BURNETT:  What was it that kept that show so popular?   </p><p>THICKE:  I think it was me, Erin.  It was all me.  I carried it. </p><p>MOOS:  He's kidding. </p><p>\"Growing Pains\" saved him from his most painful TV experience.   </p><p>THICKE:  We'll be back in a moment to see what else will happen. </p><p>MOOS:  A failed talk show that went up against the buzz saw of Johnny Carson.   </p><p>Thicke also composed theme songs to the \"Facts of Life,\" and \"Different Strokes\" and \"Wheel of Fortune.\"   </p><p>In his last movie role, Thicke dropped his good a dad persona to play a bad father.   </p><p>THICKE:  It is not my fault and I don't care anyway.   </p><p>MOOS:  But he sure cared about his wife and his three sons, and his fans cared about him.   </p><p>THICKE:  Final curtain. </p><p>MOOS:  Jeanne Moos, CNN, New York. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>BURNETT:  Sad to lose him.

But really, the scale of this is just incredible particularly for companies that have been hit before.</p><p>BURNETT: And you've been talking to sources, you know, when you say criminal actor, I mean, how serious is this, Jim?</p><p>SCIUTTO: It shows the extent and the power of cyber hacks. I mean just keep in mind, we're coming out of an election where a state actor, we know Russia had very significant impact or at least expanse of what they were able to reach in the Democratic Party, et cetera. We reported earlier this week that they also broke into Republican Party accounts. So you see the power of this in a number of domains.</p><p>Here, this is more business domain and a company, one of America's premier technology companies that is now revealed major hacks twice in the span of several months. And it's just -- it also raises the question for this particular company, did they do enough to protect their account after this half a billion person breach? Clearly, they did not.</p><p>BRUNETT: Sure, they did not. All right, Jim Sciutto, thank you.</p><p>And also new tonight, we are learning <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>will assume some of the duties normally assigned to the first lady. A source tells Ivanka will have an office in the East Wing where the current office of the First Lady is located, transition aides calling it the \"Office of the First Family.\"</p><p>This comes as Ivanka and her brothers Don Jr. and Eric today sat in on a meeting between the president-elect and Silicon Valley leaders' billionaire. As you see Jeff Bezos was there, Tim Cook from Apple, <person><nameText>Sheryl Sandberg </nameText></person>sitting next to Mike Pence from Facebook.</p><p>The presence of the Trump children at that meeting further blurring, already incredibly blurred the lines between their duties as the people who are suppose to manage Trump's business empire and have nothing to do with the government and a role in the White House.</p><p>Don Jr. tonight tweeting about his involvement in the tech meeting, \"Honored to have sat in on this meeting, the most impressive group of minds I've seen assembled all looking to fight for America and U.S. jobs.\" CNN has learned that Don Jr. also an avid hunter was heavily involved in the selection process for Secretary of the Interior playing a big role in picking that nominee, Montana Representative Ryan Zinke.</p><p>Jeff Zeleny begins our coverage tonight. And, Jeff, you know, there are laws against this, but this truly is a family affair.</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: A family affair indeed, Erin. And <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump's </nameText></person>office likely in the East Wing of the White House where the First Lady has work is the sure sign that she will be a central part of the Trump White House.</p><p>Now, of course, the Trump children have always had a seat at their father's table at Trump Tower. It appears that will continue when he moves to the White House.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZELENY: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>has made clear his sons will oversee the old family business while he's in the White House. But they are also playing a key role setting up the new family business helping select the Trump cabinet.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT-ELECT: I think it's going to be one of the great cabinets ever, ever, ever.</p><p>ZELENY: The latest example, the Interior Department. <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>interviewed candidates and CNN has learned persuaded his father to tap Ryan Zinke, a Montana congressman and former Navy SEAL as Interior Secretary. It's a position Trump's oldest child once eyed for himself.</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP.JR., </nameText></person>SON OF <person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP</nameText></person>: Our big insight joke over Thanksgiving and Christmas now that these things become very real with the presidencies. You know, \"Hey, Don, the only thing you'd be doing in government is actually interior.\" So I don't know if I would be the head of it or just informing them.</p><p>ZELENY: Whether it's a conflict of interest or simply becoming the new normal in Washington, the lines between some real estate empire and government are blurring. His other son, <person><nameText>Eric Trump, </nameText></person>said in on at least one interview for Secretary of State.</p><p>[19:05:03] Shortly after the election, his daughter <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>drew fire for attending a meeting with her father and the Japanese Prime Minister. Today, all three children sat in on their father's meeting with high-tech executives.</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to be not only great, we're going to be greater than ever before.</p><p>ZELENY: CNN has learned the office of First Lady will become the office of first family after Trump becomes president. His adviser say Trump's children have always had a seat at the table and will continue too in the Oval Office.</p><p>SEAN SPICER: RNC COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Bottom line is that he's been very clear from day one with his family -- with the role of his family plays and the trust that he has in them in terms of how to guide decisions.</p><p>ZELENY: <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>who's long been an avid outdoors man has expressed his vision for Interior Secretary.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: He assures that under a Trump residency, I'm going to have his ear, my brother, Eric, is going to have his ear. We're hunters. We're reloaders. We're competitive shooters. This is what we do. We live the lifestyle.</p><p>ZELENY: But far more than a love of hunting, the Interior Department also has a direct connection to Trump's businesses, including the new Trump hotel in Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ZELENY: Now, the Trump family relieve it -- received a tax break of more than $30 million to restore that old post office, which is still own by the federal government and leased by the Trumps. That program is run by the National Park Service, which is part of the Interior Department. And, Erin, that's where the questions of potential conflict lie. When <person><nameText>Donald Trump Jr. </nameText></person>who will run the Trump Real Estate Empire is also helping pick cabinet secretaries, it's clear the wall between the family business and the presidency are not so clearly defined.</p><p>BURNETT: Yup, all right. Thank you very much Jeff.</p><p>And \"OutFront\" now, Mark Preston, our Executive Political Editor, Jackie Kucinich, the Washington Bureau Chief for \"The Daily Beast,\" Jamie Gangel, Special Correspondent and Criminal Defense Attorney, former Prosecutor Paul Callan.</p><p>Mark, so let's start with this issue. I want to get to the hotel in a moment, but Don Jr., sitting in on a meeting today, tweeting about the meeting with the tech CEOs, the interviewing and vetting a cabinet nominee. This is Trump's son who Trump this week said on Twitter would be the one running the Trump businesses.</p><p>MARK PRESTON, CNN POLITICS EXECUTIVE EDITOR: Right. Not until next month, though. Not until next month when they hold the news conference. For me having his family involved in providing guidance, analysis, whatever it maybe isn't an issue. The idea, though, that they are running his empire and that they're helping make you decisions, that is the issue.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JACKIE KUCINICH, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, \"THE DAILY BEAST\": Right, if the two things simultaneously.</p><p>PRESTON: Correct. That is the big issue. Presidents have always relied on their family for some kind of counsel, but this is a little too close for comfort.</p><p>KUCINICH: You'll never be able to restore lines if you basically -- you have a water color going into this. It doesn't just like start over the day that the presidency starts. There is -- I mean, those pictures of the kids sitting ...</p><p>BURNETT: Right. It's going to change in a few weeks is not going to fly (ph).</p><p>KUCINICH: Well, exactly, especially because these advisers, these tech CEOs, they were sitting -- they see the children sitting there. That's a message ...</p><p>PRESTON: Right.</p><p>KUCINICH: ... that, you know, if you're sitting down with Don Jr., you're also very - you're very much aligned with the president.</p><p>BURNETT: A family affair, Jamie, because as I mentioned at the top of the show, we are reporting Trump will name the traditional office of the First Lady, the office of the first family. There are laws, nepotism laws in this country that prevent a president from formally hiring his family. JAMIE GANGEL, CNN SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT: Right.</p><p>BURNETT: Naming the office the office of the first family if you don't formally hire them would appear to go clearly against the spirit of that law.</p><p>GANGEL: It may go against it, but I think as we've seen over and over again, welcome to the world of <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>GANGEL: And it may actually be a very clever way of getting around it because if it's a family role, it's a family role. The other thing I just want to point out is <person><nameText>Eric Trump </nameText></person>was also in the meeting for Secretary of State when <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>went to meet.</p><p>BURNETT: Right.</p><p>GANGEL: So this is a repeated thing over and over again. If this is a firewall we're seeing, it's an invisible firewall because they are there every step of the way.</p><p>BURNETT: So, Paul, on the Trump hotel, right, which Jeff Zeleny has mentioned is overseen by the Interior Department. Don Jr. is going to be the one ostensibly running that hotel. He's the one who was in the meeting picking the Secretary of Interior.</p><p>There are already foreign governments using that hotel to impress Trump posting (inaudible) expensive fancy holiday parties there in just a past few weeks. If you were advising Trump what would you tell him to do? Get rid of that hotel altogether or not?</p><p>PAUL CALLAN, FORMER PROSECUTOR: Well, I'll tell what a tough job it is for a lawyer advising <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>because he's got his own opinions about the law and about this kind of advice. But my advice would be wall yourself off specifically from pieces of business that have interaction with foreign countries. And a hotel is a classic example.</p><p>For instance, at the hotel there's a suite that supposedly rents for 20 grand a night. Now let say the Soviet Union decides, \"We're going to book that thing for a year while we negotiate treaties with the United States,\" obviously, that would subject him to enormous political criticism. But he might in violation of the Emoluments Clause of the constitution.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CALLAN: Yes, yes.</p><p>BURNETT: I know, but if ...</p><p>CALLAN: Does that file (ph) like the constitution? It might very well and subject Trump to impeachment. So I'd be really careful about that if I were giving advice to the president. [19:10:02] PRESTON: You know what I think, one of the biggest problems is, is that the oversight is supposed to come from Congress and Congress is now being led by Republicans in both chambers. Now, I'm not saying that they are not going to do their job, but there's going to be an incredible amount of pressure on House Republicans and Senate Republicans who oversee the committees, who have the oversight, who have the ability for subpoena power to make sure that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>or his kids aren't crossing the line.</p><p>And let's give him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't cross the line, but the fact of the matter is there needs to be a watchdog on this and right now I don't know if Congress is that watchdog.</p><p>BURNETT: And which, of course, Jackie has a huge issue here, because there's no sign, you know, that anything is going to change as you make the point. So those tech CEOs, they saw who was in that room today.</p><p>KUCINICH: Right.</p><p>BURNETT: They saw who was there. That was a very strong message. These people matter and Trump even went so far as to say there's no hierarchy here. Call me, call anyone, right, as if, you know, call one, call all.</p><p>KUCINICH: Yeah, exactly.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>KUCINICH: You know and that -- that's a problem. But I would disagree with you a little bit, because it's not like they're all in lock step right now when it comes to Trump and Russia. They're pushing forward Mitch McConnell, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, Bob Corker are pushing forward with an investigation into this hacking. I'm not conflating the two, but I'm saying that there are things that they think Congress will take and run with whether -- and if this gets bad enough to your point ...</p><p>BURNETT: Then they would.</p><p>KUCINICH: ... then they would, because then their jobs get on the line and let's be honest there. Everyone is a self-preservationalist (ph) ...</p><p>BURNETT: Jamie, you mentioned <person><nameText>Eric Trump </nameText></person>being in the meeting -- one of the meetings with <person><nameText>Mitt Romney. </nameText></person>You have some new reporting on exactly what happen there, why <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>did not get picked by <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and the reporting is that the Trump didn't even look at him seriously. You're saying he did.</p><p>GANGEL: We are told that he absolutely looked at him seriously and I think there were three things. The first thing we've learned is that Trump would have liked an apology for Romney to say he was wrong, not immediately.</p><p>He didn't say that at the beginning, but after Kellyanne Conway and other members of his close advisors came out blistering, Trump said to Romney, \"You know, could you please apologize? You need to nullify.\" Not only did Trump, but Reince Priebus, who was a big fan of <person><nameText>Mitt Romney's </nameText></person>did it and Mike Pence.</p><p>BURNETT: That's interesting.</p><p>GANGEL: <person><nameText>Mitt Romney </nameText></person>declined to do that. That said, I think one of the most interesting things we've learned is the two men got along very, very well and Trump told people, much to his surprise, I really like him. So by all accounts this was serious.</p><p>BURNETT: But not enough.</p><p>GANGEL: Not enough.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: Not enough.</p><p>GANGEL: Not enough.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: ... book this week.</p><p>GANGEL: And where (ph) she was the big issue.</p><p>BURNETT: Yeah.</p><p>GANGEL: They had two different world views and Rex Tillerson solved that, you know, problem for him.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Thanks to all.</p><p>And next, Trump wants Apple to bring back American jobs. So he's been really aggressive about this. So here's the thing, we did the math, if your iPhone was made in America, how much more would it cost? We're going to give you the number. Would you pay it?</p><p>Plus, college officials warning immigrant student, \"If you traveled get back to the United States before Trump is president.\" Real fear or complete fear mongering? And remember America's dad, Alan Thicke?</p><p>ALAN THICKE, ACTOR: Dan, what are you doing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Walking Carol flirt with some guy and he is not Bobby.</p><p>THICKE: Well, that's none of your business with the guy.</p><p>[19:15:57] BURNETT: Tonight, Silicon Valley millionaires and billionaires face to face with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>the president-elect reaching out to big tech company CEOs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I won't tell you the hundreds of calls we've had asking to come to this meeting. And I will say Peter research saying (ph), no, that company is too small and he's a monster company, there's nobody like you in the world, in the world. There's nobody like the people in this room and anything we can do to help this go along and we're going to do that for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: The meeting included, you saw some of their faces there, leaders from Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, a company that Trump has slammed during the campaign. Dan Simon is \"OutFront.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Apple, Apple, Apple, boycott Apple.</p><p>DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It was one of candidate Trump's main targets on the campaign trail.</p><p>TRUMP: Boycott Apple until they do it. Boycott them, who cares.</p><p>SIMON: First, blasting the company for refusing to unlock an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters.</p><p>TRUMP: Give me a break, why wouldn't they want to do it?</p><p>SIMON: Trump then turns his sides to Apple's overseas manufacturing saying this at nearly every campaign rally.</p><p>TRUMP: We're going to have Apple building their product in the United States, not in China and Vietnam and all over.</p><p>And believe me, if I'm president that's going to happen.</p><p>SIMON: But analysts called that highly unlikely. For starters, consumers would probably have to pay a lot more for their next iPhone. Estimates vary, but perhaps double the amount. An iPhone 7 starting at $650 could go for $1,300 or more.</p><p>Apple's top manufacturer is the Taiwanese firm Foxconn with factories all over China. Workers get paid roughly $400 a month to assemble iPhones, but in the U.S. workers would make a minimum of nearly $1,000 a month, at least double the wages of a Chinese laborer, costs that could be absorbed by consumers.</p><p>TIM BARAJIN, ANALYST: That price of an iPhone or whatever it is would go up exponentially.</p><p>SIMON: And technology analyst Tim Barajin says any job gains would be eroded over time with robots, not people building the phones.</p><p>BARAJIN: I would argue that any job that has a lot of repetitive tasks is going to move to robotics over the next 10 years. SIMON: Apple designs its products in the U.S., but herein says at least 80 percent of its raw supplies also come from overseas, which makes building an iPhone in America seem even more impractical.</p><p>TRUMP: When they Apple, it's not wonderful, but they make everything outside.</p><p>SIMON: While Trump recently told \"Time Magazine\" that he challenged Apple to build its biggest plant yet in the U.S. instead of China, the company points out its technology is directly responsible for widespread job creation in the U.S. from its engineers and retail employees to app developers.</p><p>TIM COOK, APPLE CEO: We've created 1.9 million jobs now in the United States and we have tens of millions of customers who use our products. We work for them and we love deeply our country.</p><p>SIMON: But Trump's criticism may be having an impact. Foxconn says it's now on talks to expand it's presence in the U.S.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[19:20:08] SIMON: Well, the bottom line is an iPhone made in America is probably a campaign pledge that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>will not be able to fulfill. That said, Foxconn did tell CNN that it isn't preliminary discussions to expand its operation in the U.S. but no timetable when something like that would happen.</p><p>Erin, Apple once again reiterating that it is responsible for 2 million jobs in the U.S., some of them work in this retail shop behind me, which I'm told is pretty busy this time of year. Erin?</p><p>BURNETT: A lot of retial jobs. All right, thank you very much, Dan Simon. I mean, that's pretty excellent reporting. You go down, you get the bottom line here of what the reality is. Would you pay double?</p><p>\"OutFront\" now, President of the Economic Future Group, Jonathan Tasini and Senior Policy Analyst of the Heritage Foundation, Salim Furth.</p><p>So, Jonathan, let me start with you. You saw Dan Simon's report. Would people just on this bottom line issue, $650, now $1,350 or more possibly later, could people really pay that much? Would they be willing to pay that much for made in America?</p><p>JONATHAN TASINI, PRESIDENT, ECONOMIC FUTURE GROUP: Well, let separate could be and would they be willing. In some -- in a certain way the iPhone is not a good example of manufacture in America and what people would pay because it's such a luxury, almost a mythical item and I've got one here and as you know people line up for days sometimes for the newest iPhone.</p><p>So I suspect, perhaps, in the beginning there might be some sticker shock, but people eventually would buy the product. The more important thing to me is, what are the wages the people are going to be paid to actually manufacture in the United States those items.</p><p>BURNETT: But you think that because it is a prestige and luxury item, people would pick.</p><p>TASINI: I suspect ...</p><p>BURNETT: (Inaudible) they could pay that. They could do a whole ad campaign, made in America. There's an iPhone.</p><p>TASINI: I think that the made in America campaign you're paying here. And I will say that I did -- as focus groups some years ago about people shopping at Walmart, not the same kind of level of prices, but people said if they knew that people are getting higher healthcare and better wages that they would be willing to pay more at Walmart. I think the same, although at a higher price, would be true about the iPhone.</p><p>BURNETT: All right, Salim, what do you say, $1,350 or possibly more for an iPhone.</p><p>SALIM FURTH, SENIOR POLICY ANALYST, THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION: I think if Apple thought that they could make more money selling iPhones for 1,300 bucks, they'd be doing it right now. And so I trust the Apple to understand its way to make new profit and, you know, the rumor or potential talks that Foxconn is going to move some of its operations to the U.S., that's great.</p><p>But if they're doing that, that's not a publicity stunt. They're doing that because they see a way to make money using American expertise, American workers who are terrific and American capital investment and we need to make a business environment that attracts that kind of investment that makes sense from a bottom line perspective.</p><p>TASINI: Well, let's understand this. Workers in China and workers in the United States are equally skilled. The difference here is wages. In China and in other countries, we're looking at the reason that Apple is over there, other countries are over there, it's because they're playing slave wages. The difference is not about skill, I think that's almost the racist nationalist thing to say that we have better workers here. It's about wages. This is about profit.</p><p>BURNETT: So let me just interject here. And first of all, I want all of you to tweet us. Let us know would you pay 1,350 for an iPhone. But that issue, Tim Cook says you're wrong. He says no, this is all about skills. They have the skills in China, not here. He was on \"60 Minutes\" last year and he answer the question. Here's how he put it, Jonathan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COOK: China put an enormous focus on manufacturing in what we would call -- you and I would call vocational kind of skills. I mean you could take every tool and dye maker in United States and probably put them in the room they were currently sitting in. In China, you would have to have multiple football fields. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIN: You say rubbish.</p><p>TASINI: It's rubbish. I mean people -- there are plenty of good skilled workers here, plenty of good skilled workers in China. The issue is wages. The reason Apple is in China is because they are profiting, because they're essentially using slave labor.</p><p>And there are plenty of good people here both who lost jobs before who are -- who worked assembly line jobs in industrial America, plenty of people to be trained for this. This is not such highly skilled work, particularly assembly of this iPhone (ph).</p><p>ERIN: So, Salim, what do you say? I mean as Tim Cook write, he's saying its skills, but Jonathan has a point, right? I mean, you just saw the numbers in the piece. $400 a month is what you pay a work in China to put an iPhone together. It would be $1,000 in the United States. It would seem this is about numbers, not about skills.</p><p>FURTH: Right. So manufacturing in the U.S. has some other advantages that tend to offset those wage costs. For instance, your less shipping cost, you're not dealing with multiple regulatory regimes. So, yeah, American workers are going to make more. They are closer to the market. They have better outside options.</p><p>Chinese workers, they maybe making very low wages, but when the alternative is to go back to a rural village with no jobs, they're willing to take those jobs. I know these allegations of slave labor, but the evidence is that a great many rural Chinese have moved to the cities very willingly to take these industrial level jobs that are similar to what our grandparents worked in the United States.</p><p>TASINI: Well, as Jesse Jackson who used to say even slaves had jobs. And those folks who are moving from rural China, yes, they were in deep poverty. They have no choice and some of them are living in just awful conditions.</p><p>[19:25:03] BURNETT: All right. Well, thank you both very much. I appreciate your time tonight. And, again, please vote us to know, would you pay 1,350 for an iPhone? It's a crucial question for <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>\"OutFront\" next, colleges across the country warning immigrant students that if you leave the United States, get back before Trump is inaugurated or you might not be allowed back it. Is this crossing the line? And <person><nameText>Ivanka Trump </nameText></person>and her husband, Jared Kushner house hunting in Georgetown. So, where could they be moving? We went to look. Did you know Jackie Kennedy's old home is on the market?</p><p>BURNETT: Warning tonight to students who are undocumented immigrants. If you are traveling outside the United States, come back before President-elect Trump is inaugurated. Now, that is coming from California State University. We're hearing similar messages from officials at the University of California campuses. It's pretty stunning, but it's happening.</p><p>Kyung Lah is \"OutFront\" live in Los Angeles tonight. And, Kyung, I mean, this is incredible to hear. What are university officials actually saying?</p><p>KYUNG LAH, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What we're talking about here is the letter from Cal State's Chancellor, the office of the chancellor, a letter that was sent to the faculty of all 23 campuses and a letter to assesses what to do about Dhaka students, the so- called dreamers and what happens after the inauguration.</p><p>Students who are traveling overseas writes the chancellor should, \"Stay foot.\" Basically return and stay foot in the United States. We want to take a look at one segment of this letter quote, he writes, \"Immediately inform your students who are already abroad that unless they return by January 19th there is no assurance they will be allowed to return to the U.S. and there is a realistic possibility that they will be denied re-entry.\"</p><p>[19:30:05] The statement coming because of all of the rhetoric we heard from the president-elect during the campaign trail and what the letter further explains, Erin, is you have to be prepared about what happens after inauguration. How many students are we talking about, Erin? We are talking about only a handful according to Cal State, perhaps ten. But the issue is what they are trying to drive at, what to do about these students who are in flux, Erin?</p><p>BURNETT: So what's been the reaction, Kyung?</p><p>LAH: Oh, this is such a highly emotional issue, especially here in California. Where you have a high population of immigrant students at these campus, Latinos and Asians. We spoke with one UCLA student, a UCLA student speaking with one of our affiliates. And she says, basically, what they are feeling is uncertainty and fear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLE CORONA, UCLA STUDENT: I was just 3 years old. It's not -- I didn't have a voice and I've grown up here. I've grown up reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. And just the idea of being vulnerable to deportations is crazy, because there is nothing for me to go back to. This is my home now and I have as much of a right to be here as my peers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAH: And the last word we heard from the president-elect was an interview we did with \"TIME\" magazine. And in that interview, while he would not back down on ending President Obama's executive orders on immigration he did say he would, quote, \"work something out\" in regards to these DACA students.</p><p>We should point out, Erin, that the people who supported Mr. Trump and voted for him, many of them still do consider these DACA students illegal, even though they came across with their parents -- Erin.</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Kyung, thank you very much.</p><p>OUTFRONT now, Ben Ferguson, conservative radio show host and Keith Boykin, former aide in the Clinton White House.</p><p>So, Ben, look, you just heard what Kyung said. Trump has called President Obama's executive actions on immigration illegal. He actually was very clear about this on the campaign trail. Let me play what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP </nameText></person>(R), PRESIDENT-ELECT: We will immediately terminate President Obama's two illegal executive amnesties, in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately 5 million illegal immigrants, 5 million.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: So, he had said we would terminate the executive action. So, what is the bottom line here? The chancellor and the university's justified fear? Or fear mongering?</p><p>BEN FERGUSON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: No, this is fear mongering in the most sad and I think sick form, because you actually have students that may believe genuinely that January 20th they are not going to be allowed back into the country. One it would be virtually impossible for that to take effect on the same day even if that was something he wanted them to do.</p><p>But <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is also been clear that if you came to this country and you are very young, specifically these students under this category DACA, that he's going look at how to have some sort of compromise. There's been no indication from <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>that he would go after and punish people that came here at a very young age against their will and have no say so, or these students.</p><p>But to put it out there that if you don't back to the United States of America by January 19th, at midnight, that somehow you are going to be left out of this country and never get back in. It's absolutely fearmongering and it's sick and it's sad and it's perverted that they are using this for political gain for their messaging.</p><p>BURNETT: Keith?</p><p>KEITH BOYKIN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I'm sorry. I thought it was fear mongering when the president-elect of the United States of America went all across the country during his campaign saying he was going to deport people and create a deportation force. I thought it was fearmongering --</p><p>FERGUSON: There are people who are going to be deported.</p><p>BOYKIN: -- when the president elect said he was going repeal President Obama's policies on the immigration form. I thought it was fearmongering when the president-elect said all these policies were illegal. But somehow, the University of California -- FERGUSON: Some of them are.</p><p>BOYKIN: -- because they are articulating a concern, a valid concern that they should be careful not to be out of the country, that they are fearmongering and not the president-elect of the United States --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOYKIN: It seems to be an absurd assertion.</p><p>BURNETT: So, let me just, Keith, you know, he said the things he said in those rallies. OK. Ben. He did. But in an interview with \"TIME\" magazine, last week. So this is after he won the White House. He said something very specific.</p><p>FERGUSON: Made it very clear.</p><p>BURNETT: OK, Keith, let me move it to you. He said, \"We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud.\" He's talking about the DACA students, these DREAMers, these college kids. \"They got brought here at the very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here, some were good students, some have wonderful jobs and they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen.</p><p>Keith, is that enough that these, Cal State, California campuses should have seen this and said wait a minute we shouldn't have put that warning out there?</p><p>BOYKIN: Absolutely not. I mean, this is the problem with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>not just on the issue of DACA, but on every other issue, in healthcare reform, issues that deal with ISIS, and other foreign policy issues.</p><p>[19:35:09] There is no specificity to anything he says. So he goes out and give these campaign speeches and gets everybody riled up but he doesn't offer --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOYKIN: He's like his healthcare plan. It's terrific care. There is no specificity, Ben. And even tries --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOYKIN: -- on lack of information that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>providing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: So, Ben, what does it mean and what is specific here, because he did explain they worked hard in coming here et cetera, et cetera. But his solution was we're going to show something that makes people happy and proud. What's the specific in this?</p><p>FERGUSON: His specific point is, there is going to be a compromise here and when he becomes the president he's sworn in on January 20th, he's going work on some sort of compromise.</p><p>BOYKIN: Some sort of compromise.</p><p>FERGUSON: Let me finish what I'm going to say about this that students that have been here, that came here at a young age. We're going to work on a compromise for them. I'm in favor of that compromise.</p><p>There are some people here illegally that should be deported. He's made that clear. That is not talking about these students that are under DACA.</p><p>For the presidents and universities to go out there after he did this interview with \"TIME\" magazine and said these students are somebody who shouldn't have to live in never land --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERGUSON: I'm not filibustering. I'm stating what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>--</p><p>BOYKIN: OK.</p><p>FERGUSON: Way too far.</p><p>BURNETT: Go ahead, Keith.</p><p>BOYKIN: At some point I issue you would accept the idea that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is at least partially responsible for the rhetoric and climate he's created. And not always assume that rhetoric is at fault.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: Let him finish.</p><p>BOYKIN: You are always assuming the person responding to the rhetoric is at fault. But there is one person who is in charge here, who is creating the climate and that's <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Let's hold him accountable. Let's ask for specificity. Don't give him a blank check to do whatever.</p><p>He should at this point, 35 days before he becomes president, he should have some idea of what he's going to do and you and I have no idea what that is. That is a problem. And there are 740,000 people out there who are DREAMers, who are concerned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: Isn't it true that he hasn't been clear on exactly what that is? He did say he's going to repeal all these things. Now, he's saying I want to make people happy and proud. But wouldn't it be incumbent on him to be a little more clear?</p><p>FERGUSON: I think that is exactly what he was doing in \"TIME\" magazine and hen he specifically talks about DACA students and specifically says that we're going to make people happy, it is at that point -- BOYKIN: Happy is not a policy.</p><p>FERGUSON: When he's talk about the happy I'm pretty sure we can be intellectually honest enough that means some sort of compromise here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERGUSON: You just don't like <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>in general and you don't like what he says in general, but I'll finish my point by saying this. When <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>says that in \"TIME\" magazine it is irresponsible for presidents of universities for their own political reasons to terrify students that are under that category in their university system --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT: We hit pause there for tonight. Thank you both.</p><p>Next, did this woman singlehandedly crush Trump's stock market rally?</p><p>And the billionaires of Trump's cabinet house-hunting in D.C. We're going to take you to the new billionaires row.</p><p>[19:42:05] BURNETT: Interest rates going up for just the second time in a decade, in a decade. The Fed announcing that constitutional rights will go up. A quarter of a point but it effects all of us. And when the chief of the Fed actually took questions today, they weren't not about. That they were almost all about a man who repeatedly attacked her on the campaign trail, <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>JANET YELLEN, </nameText></person><person><nameText>FEDERAL RESERVE </nameText></person>CHAIR: I'm not going to offer the incoming president advice about how to conduct himself in policy. I'm a strong believer in the independence of the Fed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: Phil Mattingly is OUTFRONT.</p><p>And, Phil, <person><nameText>Janet Yellen, </nameText></person>the chief of the Fed, was a frequent target of the president-elect during the campaign. It was almost all she was asked about today. It would be an understatement to say he's not a fan of hers.</p><p>PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, an understatement is never a great strategy when you're talking about the president-elect. Look, it is normal in an election, in a campaign, in the White House that you don't talk about the <person><nameText>Federal Reserve. </nameText></person>They are supposed to be a very defined wall there. You can't get Josh Earnest or President Obama ever to weigh in.</p><p>That's not necessarily the case with <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Take a listen to him on the campaign trail.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>TRUMP: This <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>of the Fed. The Fed is doing political. The Fed is being more political than Secretary Clinton.</p><p><person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>should have raised the rates. She's not doing it because the Obama administration and the president doesn't want her to.</p><p>I think she's very political and to a certain extent I think she should be ashamed of herself.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>MATTINGLY: Now, Erin, the interesting element here is be careful what you wish for. It's easier to talk when you're not sitting in the White House about the need to raise rates. Well, those rates are now going up and as you noted that could be problems for <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>economy.</p><p>And you look at the Fed minutes today what exactly came out. And they are talking about raising rates at an increased level than they originally were, as many as three times next year. That could restrict growth, restrict kind of where kind of <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants this economy to be.</p><p>And it's worth noting as well, when you look at the president-elect's economic plans, and this is important, a major tax cut, a major stimulus coming from a major infrastructure plan. Those are the types of things that spark inflation concerns. Inflation concerns in and of themselves, obviously, as you know well, Erin, those cause rate increases as well. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said a lot of things about <person><nameText>Janet Yellen. </nameText></person>She may have the power do a lot of things next year that he doesn't appreciate very much.</p><p>BURNETT: That's for sure. All right. Thank you very much, Phil.</p><p>And OUTFRONT now, the president of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco, who knows this better than anyone.</p><p>Jim, you hear <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>talked about <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>with words like she is not a Republican. When her time is up, I would most likely replace, criticized her aggressively. There is supposed to be this wall.</p><p>Is there any concern that he has said these things, that he may try to influence the Fed or that the Fed could try to seek revenge on <person><nameText>Donald Trump?</nameText></person></p><p>JIM BIANCO, PRESIDENT, BIANCO RESEARCH: Well, yes, you are right. That the historical rules of that you don't criticize the Fed have been thrown out the window right now. He is criticizing the Fed. The belief on Wall Street is when <person><nameText>Janet Yellen's </nameText></person>term ends in January of 2018, we'll have another <person><nameText>federal reserve </nameText></person>chairman. It won't be her. And we can debate about who it might be.</p><p>But there are going to be big changes at the <person><nameText>Federal Reserve </nameText></person>over the next year to 18 months. BURNETT: In the meantime, obviously, raising interest rates, as Phil was explaining. Right, it costs everybody more money and that can hurt an economy. Trump is incredibly proud of his stock market rally, right? Incredibly proud. Stocks had their worst day today in two months, because of <person><nameText>Janet Yellen, </nameText></person>because of the Fed rate hike. She sort of slaid his rally.</p><p>He, though, is still boasting about it. He is proud of it. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We're doing well right now. And I'm very honored by the bounce. They are talking about the bounce. So, right now, everybody in the room has to like me at least a little bit. But we're going to try and have that bounce continue.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURNETT: That was this afternoon. Obviously, stocks were doing the exact opposite. But he was talking about people in that room. You know, Goldman Sachs in that room. Their stocks up 30 percent since <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>he is a big part of the reason for that.</p><p>Did she just kill the rally?</p><p>BIANCO: You know, it is the opening question. Basically interest rates won out and they can go up for one of two reasons. They can go up because of real growth, real economic growth is getting better and that would be a very good thing for the stock market and for the economy. Or they can go up because there is a fear that inflation is coming back.</p><p>Now put it in a different way, the Trump rally has always been called the reflation rally. But what are we reflating? Up until a couple of days ago, we were thinking we were reflating the real economy. But now, Wall Street and the markets are starting to worry we're reflating inflation.</p><p>And if that's what we're doing, then it won't be taken well by the stock market. And maybe today was one of the first salvos, and in creating inflation, we're not creating real growth. And that's what the question we're going to grapple with in 2017.</p><p>BURNETT: And what's your bottom line, your point of view? Tax cuts that he's talked about, a trillion dollars in infrastructure, real growth or not?</p><p>BIANCO: Well, in and of itself, I think the tax cuts and stimulus can be a good thing. But the devil is always in the details. If it winds up to be this politically motivated we're going take care of the people we take care of and do a bunch of the projects that don't really help the economy, it is not going to help. But if we do the things that we need to do as far as infrastructure spending and about things that will help promote growth, it can help. So, it's more than just a trillion dollars, what trillion dollars are going to do with it?</p><p>BURNETT: All right. Thank you very much, Jim Bianco.</p><p>And next, a nearly $12 million condo is said to be the most expensive in Washington D.C. Look inside, you will go there.

Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. </p><p>European regulators have also investigated here - ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. But it appears regulators are growing more concerned not just with the effects on regular internet users, but on smaller companies as well.</p><p>'On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'' King said. 'But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.'</p><p>One outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, she said.</p><p>Then there's Google's smartphone operating system, Android. Another acquisition of Google's, the system is the most widely used in the world.</p><p>European regulators have also fined Google to the tune of $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced handset makers to install Google apps, thereby increasing its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.</p><p>It's also possible U.S. states won't follow in Europe's footsteps. They could, for instance, focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, yet another acquisition Google made, that time in 2006.</p><p>Google executive Walker emphasized that the company's products help people every day.</p><p>'Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation: Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone_translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have,' he wrote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-55934463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-HYB1-JCJY-G4TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><timeReceived>7:21 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The second out of four workshops under the European Committee for Standardization's (CEN) rules will be hosted by UNESCO in its Paris headquarters on Tuesday, 5 February.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Journalism Trust Initiative (JTI) aims at creating a mechanism to reward media outlets for providing guarantees regarding transparency, verification and correction methods, editorial independence and compliance with ethical norms. Launched by Reporters sans frontieres and its partners, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), Agence France Presse (AFP) and the Global Editors Network (GEN), the initiative is pursuing a self-regulatory and voluntary, though authoritative process.</p><p>At the upcoming meeting in Paris on Tuesday (Feb 5), the group of stakeholders, composed of around 120 representatives of media outlets, regulatory authorities, tech companies, academia and international organizations, will discuss first drafts of indicators to identify trustworthy journalism and thus, guide both human and algorithmic decision making in news distribution and consumption.</p><p>Three so-called drafting committees and an advisory technical task-force gathered for preparatory meetings already on Monday (Feb 4).</p><p>The missing link</p><p>\"It's not rocket science to define the basic journalistic principles : many ethical codes exist as long as journalism exists,\" claimed Christophe Deloire, RSF's Secretary General. As a major problem he mentioned the algorithmic distribution of online content, because it does not include an \"integrity factor\" and amplifies everything that goes against these professional norms - sensationalism, rumours, falsehoods and hate. Therefore existing best practices of the journalistic trade need to be translated to code of the Internet. This is a condition to reverse its logic, according to Deloire, by rewarding and eventually re-monetizing compliance with these norms.</p><p>\"JTI is the missing link between journalistic principles and methods on one side, and algorithms on the other\", he added.</p><p>Sorted into the three different drafting committees, the project is currently developp machine-readable criteria for media outlets, big and small, in the domains of identity and ownership, journalistic methods and ethics.</p><p>Journalists in charge</p><p>\"We understand that there is a substantial demand for these indicators, on the side of major platforms, advertisers, but also regulators and the media sector itself\", explained Bertrand Pecquerie, GEN's CEO. But according to him, the process of developing them must be fully self-regulatory. \"We do not want to see governments or regulators or advertisers or big tech telling us what good or bad journalism is\", he said, \"and therefore it must be us, the journalist's community, to take the lead!\" For this reason, the JTI's drafting committees are composed of industry professionals only, representing major media outlets like AFP, AP and dpa, the BBC, TV 5 Monde and France Television, RTL Group, Gazeta Wyborcza, Tagesspiegel or Tamedia, as well as professional organizations and NGOs like the EBU or the Ethical Journalism Network.</p><p>Other stakeholders, which are not part of the drafting committees, include Facebook and Google, Internews, the International Press Institute, the Thomson Foundation, the Worldwide Web Consortium, the French regulatory authority CSA, IMPRESS and IPSO from Britain and the German Federal Government Commissioner for Culture and the Media.</p><p>Standardization framework is key</p><p>\"Whilst many start-ups and initiatives are launching a variety of ranking and rating schemes for the media, it is essential that a universally accepted and inclusive ranking and rating scheme be developed and supported by the big players in the media world, such as Public Service Media organisations and commercial allies\", observed Noel Curran, the Director General of the EBU.</p><p>\"The scheme needs to be tested, scalable and trusted by online platforms and the public. That's why we prefer the path of standardization under CEN guidelines,\" he continued.</p><p>Curran suggested that a set of standards, once published, could then pave the way for numerous non-for-profit and commercial actors to build audit and enforcement schemes around them. Accordingly, some of them, like NewsGuard and the Global Disinformation Index, have recently joined JTI to explore synergies of the ongoing efforts.</p><p>\"We have an opportunity for a breakthrough here in providing reliable and trusted news more prominently to the public and making it easier for them to find it. In an age of fake news and misinformation that is a goal EBU Members are committed to.\"</p><p>Responsiveness matters</p><p>\"It is critical to answer properly to the public distrust in media, by offering to the citizens landmarks and visible tags on the web to distinguish trustworthy content easily\", emphasized Phil Chetwynd, AFP's Global News Director.</p><p>\"For us as a news agency, workability of the solution in the daily routine is key and it is extremely important, for all of us working on JTI, to propose a solution that serves the interests of the citizens first and foremost.\" He mentioned the public consultation stage as one critical element in drawing up a standard under CEN guidelines, but also the plan to test and evaluate the final results. \"Any standard is subject to constant review, particularly in fast-moving industries, and we expect this one to be no exception\", Chetwynd added, \"but we have to start somewhere and we have to do it now.\"</p><p>\"Promoting an enabling environment\"</p><p>UNESCO's Assistant Director-General for Communication and Information, Moez Chakchouk, re-affirmed the organization's commitment to strengthening quality journalism across the globe. On the occasion of hosting the second JTI workshop at its Paris headquarters he declared: \"We are supporting the sustainability of independent journalism, by fostering enabling environments for press freedom, in particular promoting transparency and compliance with professional standards.\"</p><p>After the Paris meetings on February 4th and 5th, another two workshops are planned including a public consultation phase. The results of the JTI will be published as a CEN Workshop Agreement at the end of 2019. The project ist hosted by the French and German standardization bodies Afnor and DIN on behalf of the European Committee for Standardization, CEN.</p><p>JTI is funded through voluntary contributions of its key stakeholders RSF, EBU and AFP, and through a grant provided by the French Ministry of Culture (Fonds de soutien a l'emergence et a l'innovation dans la presse).</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6599655 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6599655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VBY-YX01-JC11-11KD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1128\"/><timeReceived>2:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 4, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

More than 5,000,000 Europeans have signed a petition[4] againstArticle 13 of the Directive, and there has been outcry from eminent technical experts[5], the United Nations' special rapporteur on free expression[6], and many other quarters. Now, a coalition of more than 130 EU businesses have entered the fray, led by file storage service NextCloud. Their letter to the European Parliament calls Article 13\u2014which will lead to mass adoption of copyright filters for online services that will monitor and block user-submitted text, audio, video and images\u2014a 'dangerous experiment with the core foundation of the Internet's ecosystem.' </p><p>They also condemn Article 11, which will allow news publishers to decide who can quote and link to news stories and charge for the right to do so.Importantly, they identify a key risk of the Directive, which is that it will end up advantaging US Big Tech firms that can afford monitoring duties, and that will collect 'massive amounts of data' sent by Europeans. March 21st is an EU-wide day of action on the Copyright Directive, with large site blackouts planned[7] (including German Wikipedia), and on March 23, there will be mass demonstrations across the EU[8]. Things are getting down to the wire here, folks. Here's the text of the letter; you can find the original, with the full list of signatories, here[9]. The companies signing this letter to the European Parliament are urging you to vote against Articles 11 and 13 of the proposed copyright directive. The text of the trilogue agreement would harm the European economy and seriously undermine the ability of European businesses to compete with big Internet giants like Google. We support the goal of the legislation to protect the rights of creators and publishers, but the proposed measures are inadequate to reap these benefits and also fail to strike a fair balance between creators and all other parts of society. The success of our business enterprises will be seriously jeopardized by these heavy-handed EU regulations. Especially Article 13 is dangerously experimenting with the core foundation of the Internet's ecosystem. Making companies directly liable for the content of their users forces these businesses to make billions of legal decisions about the legality of content. Most companies are neither equipped nor capable of implementing the automatic content filtering mechanisms this requires, which are expensive and prone to error. Article 11 is creating a completely new intellectual property right for press publishers. The experience with similar laws in Germany and Spain raises serious doubts about the expected benefits, while the negative impact would be very real. An additional layer of exclusive rights would make it harder to clear the necessary legal hurdles to start new projects. It will make entrepreneurs more hesitant to just launch new projects. Europe would lose any chance to play a significant role on the world stage. Startups that build services based on aggregated online information would go out of business, and every company that publishes press summaries of their appearance in the media would be in violation of this law. Although the purpose of these regulations is to limit the powers of big US Internet companies like Google or Facebook, the proposed legislation would end up having the opposite effect. Article 13 requires filtering of massive amounts of data, requiring technology only the Internet giants have the resources to build. European companies will be thus forced to hand over their data to them, jeopardizing the independence of the European tech industry as well as the privacy of our users. European companies like ours will be hindered in their ability to compete or will have to abandon certain markets completely. Given all of these issues it is noteworthy that the final trilogue agreement lacks meaningful safeguards for small and medium enterprises. The broad scope of this law would most likely lead to less new companies being founded in Europe and existing companies moving their headquarters out of Europe. For all those reasons we urge every pro-Startup politician to vote against Article 11 and Article 13. We hope EU lawmakershear the concerns of these businesses and take them to heart. If you live in the EU, consider taking part in the day of action on March 21; and contact your MEP right now. Take action and stop Article 13 HERE[10].Cory Doctorow[11] is a science fiction author, activist, journalist and blogger \u2014 the co-editor of Boing Boing[12] and the author of young adult novels like HOMELAND, PIRATE CINEMA and LITTLE BROTHER and novels for adults like RAPTURE OF THE NERDS and MAKERS.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.  Shares seeing their biggest gain in  two years as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced that grilling on ca Capitol Hill  over everything from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal to possible  Russian election interference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  When you add more rules that companies  need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently  just has the resources to go do and that might just be harder for a smaller  company getting started to be able to comply with.  There are real  challenges that we face around content and privacy.  </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If we're counting on Facebook to  regulate itself, we're going to fail.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he'll  testify before house lawmakers.  He kept his cool yesterday and didn't make  the face when asked stupid questions by those Senators that everybody at  home watching did.  Fox Business will bring you that live coverage starting  at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  Tragedy in Algeria, the details after a military  plane crashes, killing at least 250 people.  Nunes fighting back, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee calls out Deputy Attorney  General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray over the  justification for the Russia probe.  The initial justification, where is  the full memo?  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol ahead and the  deadline which is today.</p><p>Investors tuning into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now the  company is looking to keep up that success.  The big plans for your  listening habits ahead.  And talk about a royal snub, both President Trump  and former President Barack Obama will not be invite ted to the upcoming  royal wedding.  Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and  the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list.  Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p>CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p>BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p>CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p>BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p>BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p>BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p>I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p>There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p>The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p>That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p>CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p>HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p>Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p>And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p>CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p>BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p>CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p>CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p>CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p>CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p>CAIN:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p>CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p>CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p>CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p>CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p>CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p>The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p>CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p>CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p>And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p>Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p>And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p>REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p>SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p>DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p>KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p>MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p>CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p>BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p>GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p>MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p>MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p>CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p>So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p>So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p>GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p>And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p>I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p>CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p>CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p>MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p>CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p>CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p>CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.  Not in the least.  But he got a big job done,  the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the  board of?  No, I don't think so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's all over my head.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office?  We'll be right  back, everybody.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thanks all, Herman Cain.  Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY:  I shall.  Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone.  The  President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, April 11th. Your top stories at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Global tensions weighing on stocks. Futures are showing losses across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket. The loss is accelerating in the last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own people and enjoys it. More on the rising tensions straight ahead. This comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports. And of course one of the top winners yesterday, Facebook. Shares seeing their biggest gain in two years as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced that grilling on ca Capitol Hill over everything from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal to possible Russian election interference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: When you add more rules that companies need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently just has the resources to go do and that might just be harder for a smaller company getting started to be able to comply with. There are real challenges that we face around content and privacy.</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If we're counting on Facebook to regulate itself, we're going to fail.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he'll testify before house lawmakers. He kept his cool yesterday and didn't make the face when asked stupid questions by those Senators that everybody at home watching did. Fox Business will bring you that live coverage starting at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. Tragedy in Algeria, the details after a military plane crashes, killing at least 250 people. Nunes fighting back, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee calls out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray over the justification for the Russia probe. The initial justification, where is the full memo? The latest on the tensions in the Capitol ahead and the deadline which is today.</p><p>Investors tuning into Spotify in its first week of trading. Now the company is looking to keep up that success. The big plans for your listening habits ahead. And talk about a royal snub, both President Trump and former President Barack Obama will not be invite ted to the upcoming royal wedding. Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list. Here to break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Happy to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you.</p><p>CAIN: Thank you.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR: Didn't get invited either to the wedding?</p><p>CAIN: No. I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have better things to do. I think.</p><p>CAIN: Yes, we do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think we all have better things to do. And I want to just point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200 point loss in the Dow futures. That's off its lows in the morning. But all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets. We seem to shift from day-to-day, from one worry to another. So what is it? Lindsey Bell is going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer price index. Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria. So again, those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White House and then geopolitical problems.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Right. And then we also have the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well. But I think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the biggest concern. I think not a lot of people have been talking about it, is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet. They are selling. We were talking about this --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop. I talk about it to my parents and they're sick of it.</p><p>BELL: Yes. And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the stock market to these news points.</p><p>MCSHANE: Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six months or a year but now it's six minutes. I mean, and now it's a presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market, tomorrow it might be something else.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so much (INAUDIBLE) on money.</p><p>CAIN: I'm a conservative. I vote Republican. Let's get that straight. Here's the thing about the market. Don't forget. It's very complex and there are a lot of moving parts. So when one part moves you've got some other parts that are going to react. It's still trying to find its balance this early in the administration. It's only been a year. Secondly, you've got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the news.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony, his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators for about five hours yesterday. Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down there. She is still on Capitol Hill. Hey, Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR: Hey, Dagen. Well, you said it. This is part of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg is facing. He talked about those five hours of questioning yesterday from Senators. Today, more to come. The House Energy and Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg. So yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that. Here's one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Your user agreement sucks. The purpose of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end. It's not to inform your users about their rights. Now you know that and I know that. I'm going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLTON: All right, Dagen. So that had a little comedic relief there, especially for the crowd. Some of the Senators were more on point about business topics. You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard product. So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about privacy, where did you stay? Where are you staying this week? What's your hotel address? Who have you message? Just underlining this difference between personal privacy and what is open to the public. So more to come, Dagen. We'll be on it. In the meantime, back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I can't wait for that, Deirdre. Deirdre Bolton down in Washington. Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear it?</p><p>BOLTON: I think so. We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?</p><p>BOLTON: Yes, yes, that was classic.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of the day.</p><p>BOLTON: You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well, saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies. You know, we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Deirdre, thank you for that. Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us. And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling. Your reaction to the testimony by Mark Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?</p><p>REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE COMMITTEE: Well, it won't be before my committee. We have another hearing with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they be able to expect. I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs to be provided.</p><p>I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease, they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want to be shared -- have shared. And so, I think the hearings will be good. I think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney. This actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this protection bureau after the financial crisis. What the heck have they been doing? Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening. Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A. Times. What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today?</p><p>HENSARLING: Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been going on at Wells Fargo. I mean, clearly all kinds of problems. I mean, I know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management. And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.</p><p>There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal agency in the history of the Republic. That was true under Richard Cordray, an Obama appointee . It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee. They're just not accountable. There's no checks and balances. They take their money straight from the Fed. They're not on the appropriations process.</p><p>The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause. The courts and there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB. And then finally, there's not even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking account or mortgage he wants to.</p><p>That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due process. They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny. So number one, they're unaccountable. Number two, they're hurting consumers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>HENSARLING: Free checking has been cut in half at banks. There are 15 percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more. It's much harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages. And so these are the problems we have to get to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.</p><p>HENSARLING: Sure.</p><p>CAIN: One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks were put out of business. We have heard that the attempts now are to roll back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to survive. Is that in the version you are working on?</p><p>HENSARLING: Well, absolutely. And this is not fake news, Herman. A lot of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific. And so the CFPB sets the standards and they roll downhill. And the big banks they have the resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks. And so small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed. We don't know where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small community banks. So, there is legislation that has come out to of the House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of our community banks. I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying on the vine.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning. He's ramping up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack. Here is just some of what he tweeted earlier. Russia vows to shoot down any in all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice new and smart. It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal, he kills his own people and enjoys it. It looks like the President has made his decision. What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies who act alongside us in this effort?</p><p>HENSARLING: Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st century are seeing the use of chemical weapons. I mean, they cannot be allowed to do this. And we know that the President's predecessor, President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let them cross it. And so I think what we're hearing from this president is you're not going to be allowed to cross that line. We are not going to introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people. They are absolutely horrific and atrocious. And so, listen, I'm not commander-in-chief. He's commander-in-chief. But Syria has to get the word, Russia has to get the word. I hope that, again, this will be measured. Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does not happen again.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.</p><p>HENSARLING: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Breaking news. A plane crash killing more than 250 people in Algeria. Cheryl Casone has the details. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen. An Algerian military jet crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people. The transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a military base shortly after takeoff. It's not clear what caused this crash but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie jet went down. That crash killed 102.</p><p>Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts. Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy. The layoff chopped company's the workforce from 125 to about two dozen. That is way down from 2015 when they had about 800 people there. Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p>Well, John Boehner, remember him? He is getting involved in the rapidly expanding U.S. marijuana industry. The former Speaker of the House has joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings. The company grows and sells marijuana in 11 states. Boehner, a Republican went on the record nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot. But now he says that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out there. And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according to Gallup survey.</p><p>And then there is this. The royal wedding just over a month away and the invitations have been sent out. Notable names missing from the guest list is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry. President Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle. Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime Minister, Theresa May. Tough invites if you can get it. All right. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there though. I'm just saying. I'm guessing that she's going to be invited potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have me as a member. That's Groucho Marx.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's good. I mean, John Boehner in the pot company? I guess let us let that go.</p><p>CAIN: Was he getting paid (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.</p><p>MCSHANE: But there's so many jokes.</p><p>BELL: He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p>CAIN: Yes. But he is still smoking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Cigarettes. He was a cigarette smoker.</p><p>CAIN: I know. But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to marijuana, who knows?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's legal in some states.</p><p>CAIN: Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the bandwagon. That's all I'm saying.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What statistics, about the --</p><p>CAIN: About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Workplace productivity.</p><p>CAIN: Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously. They haven't put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There you go.</p><p>CAIN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Herman, I love having you here.</p><p>CAIN: Thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amazon is under fire. Still we're breaking down a shocking report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of dollars in taxes last year. Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty void if removed stickers. What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling shoppers, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We have breaking news this morning. Axios is reporting that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run for re-election in November. Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election. I believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife about it. This is something I'll discuss with my wife. But again, Axio reporting he will not run again. That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.</p><p>CAIN: Well, it's a double hit. Because first, he won't be in Congress, and secondly he won't be speaker. That means the speaker position is going to be a toss-up. And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy and Scalise. Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that unfortunate accident of being shot. It's going to be a scramble for the speaker's position.</p><p>MCSHANE: I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul Ryan, isn't that fair?</p><p>CAIN: That's a fair statement. That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.</p><p>CAIN: Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House. That's just their rhetoric, the Democrats. I feel very strongly about that. I don't feel strongly about a lot of things. They're not going to take back control of the House.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.</p><p>CAIN: Yes. They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million against $8 million and the Republican won. Why? Because we were able to energize the Republican voters to get out. Money couldn't buy that seat. This is the --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p>CAIN: That's a different story.</p><p>MCSHANE: Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is true, would energize Republican basis?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAIN: I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure they're coming back but not necessarily the voters. The voters have got to be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they don't have out there right now. The results are on their side with this President. But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I agree, all over the place, what we say down south. Switching gears. The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers. Lauren Simonetti has more.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there. The Federal Trade Commission says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S. They fired off a letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and video game consoles. This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer competing products. We don't know which companies were warned but think -- Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\"</p><p>The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third party fix it. So here's an example. You buy a new Honda. It breaks. You take it to your local mechanic. They can't fix it and you take it back to Honda. The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the repair shop first. That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't know about this. We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you. So bottom line, do your homework. You can take your stuff back. This applies to Apple iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up. Usually a third party is allowed to fix it.</p><p>MCSHANE: You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday with the whole car example for a second. Which is actually a good example yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole southern trick. I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you, right?</p><p>CAIN: It might not be a trick with him. I'm just saying. Wow. I'm just saying it might not be.</p><p>MCSHANE: Coming in heavy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman. Now not so much.</p><p>CAIN: Oh, wow. I don't do political correctness. You know that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love having Herman Cain here. And the message from Lauren as those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p>SIMONETTI: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI: You're welcome.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up. A major test for Mark Zuckerberg. How the Facebook CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal, next. Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. Markets are under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer price index hitting the tape. You haven't seen much movement in the Dow Futures right here, right now. The month-over-month top line CPI was down one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected. But if you look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent, which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in the last 10 years.</p><p>And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in these Markets. Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and smart. You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p>Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the board. More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany. And in Asia overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire. New questions over Amazon and its tax practices. We take a closer look ahead. And Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against conservatives. We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the hearing later this hour.</p><p>And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia investigation. The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement does not comply. And is this the end? Is it coming for Robert Mueller? The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I know a number of individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so. We've been advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: We're looking at the fallout from those comments. And then Jim Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with his latest piece of artwork. The backlash ahead. And investors tuning into Spotify in its first week of trading. Now, the company is looking to keep up the success. The big plans for your listening habits. But first, are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered? Blake Burman joins us from the White House with a lot more. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Dagen, good morning to you. After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire Robert Mueller. The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: I know a number of individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p>REPORTER: But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire the special counsel.</p><p>SANDER: Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the power to make that decision. I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are calling for the special counsel to be protected. While the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere. Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt. We will have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p>NUNES: Absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rod Rosenstein?</p><p>NUNES: We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back. So now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information. Bad!\" Of course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the President's personal attorney. President Trump had described that earlier this week as a, quote, attack on our country. In a harsh rebuke yesterday on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote, disgrace. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always. Blake, at the White House for us. Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today. This, after testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS: Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: No.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DURBIN: If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the names of the people you've messaged?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG: Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly here.</p><p>DURBIN: I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p>KENNEDY: Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today. And I say this gently. Your user agreement sucks. You spot me 75 I.Q. points. If I can figure it out, you can figure it out. The purpose of the user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users about their rights.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google,\" Scott Galloway. Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance yesterday?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: It was remarkable on how unremarkable it was. He's -- you know, he's the winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up. There was a couple of good sound bites there. But it's nothing -- there was no real moment. And D.C. is the big looser. You think 55 adults would have gotten in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes each. Who knows technology, raise your hand? Three or four people would have raised their hand out of the 55. And they said, why don't we give each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down. It was the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p>MCSHANE: That's a really good point.</p><p>CAIN: And I agree with you, 200 percent. Absolutely. It was remarkably unremarkable. Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity to get five minutes on T.V. That's all it was about. And nothing's going to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative stuff. We will take that under advisement.</p><p>BELL: Yes, exactly. I think that's a great point, Herman. Scott, what does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p>GALLOWAY: He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook. The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE). Europe in the last week has made more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook than America has to date. France is talking about taxing them on their top line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes. They're talking about regulating Facebook and Twitter as media companies and Britain. Their GDRP is well ahead of anything we're doing. This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p>MCSHANE: See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out on t he --</p><p>MCDOWELL: The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p>MCSHANE: And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes, don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're already doing that. Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't supposed to come out and say that.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech. Information wants to be free, that was a lie. We not only comply with the tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws. That was Tim Cook. The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase them in low-tax domains. That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law. The most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure we shouldn't be regulated. I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're open to regulation. That is so ridiculous. They will fight tooth and nail any regulation.</p><p>CAIN: The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it. I agree with you. Leave them alone. Let the customers of Facebook decide Facebook's future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick frankly. You brought up taxes. I want to bring up this issue with you, Scott. 15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year. This is a report from the institute on taxes and economic policy. Amazon received $137 million rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a negative 2-1/2 percent. And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes. But again, this kind of goes to your point.</p><p>GALLOWAY: We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure. Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon has paid 1.4 billion. This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p>So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of the Hunger Games. If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life and you can avoid taxes. The tax system is so complex and so favors large multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their taxes in high-tax domains. We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively pay no tax.</p><p>So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes? And it's simple, less successful companies pay taxes. You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Absolutely. I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and its future. Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation. That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger with no control.</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the revolution is going to be consumer-led. I think consumers are lazy and talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free. I don't think this is going to be consumer-led. And when 280 million Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any choice. In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony. Advertisers have no choice but to be on Facebook. So, bottom line, this is a monopoly. I think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger, WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: You can take your mic off. Drop it. Great for you. That was a drop-the-mic moment. Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: Hey, good morning, Dagen. So, yesterday, we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping. So now, this is the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together. Last round of talks broke up at the end of November. They've now rekindled with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all the costs that they face. But now, it's who's going to have control. Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control. They obviously are the part of the T-Mobile. And then you have SoftBank Group that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint. So, this is what they're ironing out. But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get too excited.</p><p>And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might have to cut their costs. Let's look at Spotify. Spotify's an exciting story, right? We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132. But now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing great. Big product change, free music service that they're going to be pushing going forward. They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down about one percent today. And watch on April 24th, they may have a new speaker. They're going to have an announcement. Back to you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, Nicole. Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange. Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with Syria and of course Russia. In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever. Joining me now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys, because they're on their way virtually. I think we can expect a strike. I mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously. We can expect a strike in the relatively near future. My question is how does the Market react? Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place? Does the market fall some more or does it recover?</p><p>I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the Market goes up. It goes down as you wait for the fire. And then it goes up when they've been fired. I wonder if the same thing will happen this time. I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that they'll be followed up with more later? I think the market reaction depends on that. But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those missiles are launched.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is on Twitter so much. But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY: It's immediate, isn't it? I mean, it's flat-out immediate. He comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting for the tweet. They're not waiting for a statement from the State Department, they're looking for the tweet. And reliably, here it is. By the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway. I know what a socialist he is. I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of American military adventures overseas. I don't want to upset the guy in the middle of your show, OK? I just want that to be very clear.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. I love you, Stuart. You're on in nine minutes. We'll be right back.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This breaking news right here, right now. House Speaker Paul Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will retire at the end of the year. He plans to tell the GOP House members today that he will not seek re-election. Herman, your take on this.</p><p>CAIN: Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat. But they might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the Republicans in the House. And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad thing. Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there were a number of people vying for it. So, it's going to open up the competition for people who really want to be in that. And secondly, I happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough. You can't imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The thing about what happened just last year, in President Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what would have been a giant fix of Medicaid. What did the Senate do with it? Gave it a thumbs down. Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator John McCain. Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that he would be able to accomplish that. So, he has that huge win under his belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p>CAIN: He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right. So, it's going to be will be a horse race.</p><p>MCSHANE: There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that aren't big fans of Paul Ryan. That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base. So,now you have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already apparently going to announce that he's not running. That's your main fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop of everything else that's going on. You'll have a run for Republican leadership. I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the main question.</p><p>CAIN: It will be interesting. I think we'll have to wait and see. Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of politics for 2018.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I do want to point out that there was a report out that -- of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm at the base. Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p>CAIN: I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic about his leadership. So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the base.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John Boehner.</p><p>CAIN: Oh, no, no, no, no. Not in the least. But he got a big job done, the tax cuts and jobs plan.</p><p>MCSHANE: Do you think there's no marijuana company he wants to be on the board of? No, I don't think so.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's all over my head.</p><p>MCSHANE: Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Does Paul Ryan want to run for a higher office? We'll be right back, everybody.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thanks all, Herman Cain. Stuart Varney, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: I shall. Good morning, Dagen, and good morning, everyone. The President orders the Harry S. Truman carrier battle group to the Mideast.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018041103cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S33-WG31-DXH2-61B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 11, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria  Bartiromo.  It's Wednesday, April 11th.  Your top stories at 8:00 a.m.  Eastern.  Global tensions weighing on stocks.  Futures are showing losses  across the board, they're down about 200 points right now and we can report  that all 30 Dow stocks are down premarket.  The loss is accelerating in the  last hour after President Trump tweeted on Syria saying Russia vows to  shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because  they will be coming, nice and new and smart.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> You shouldn't be partnering with a gas killing animal who kills his own  people and enjoys it.  More on the rising tensions straight ahead.  This  comes one day after the Dow climbed more than 400 points, that was  following some soothing words from China's President, Xi Jinping, promising  an open market and to cut tariffs and auto imports.  And of course one of  the top winners yesterday, Facebook.  Shares seeing their biggest gain in  two years as CEO Mark Zuckerberg faced that grilling on ca Capitol Hill  over everything from the Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal to possible  Russian election interference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  When you add more rules that companies  need to follow, that's something that a larger company like ours inherently  just has the resources to go do and that might just be harder for a smaller  company getting started to be able to comply with.  There are real  challenges that we face around content and privacy.  </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: If we're counting on Facebook to  regulate itself, we're going to fail.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill this morning where he'll  testify before house lawmakers.  He kept his cool yesterday and didn't make  the face when asked stupid questions by those Senators that everybody at  home watching did.  Fox Business will bring you that live coverage starting  at 10:00 a.m. Eastern.  Tragedy in Algeria, the details after a military  plane crashes, killing at least 250 people.  Nunes fighting back, the  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee calls out Deputy Attorney  General Rod Rosenstein and FBI Director Christopher Wray over the  justification for the Russia probe.  The initial justification, where is  the full memo?  The latest on the tensions in the Capitol ahead and the  deadline which is today.</p><p> Investors tuning into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now the  company is looking to keep up that success.  The big plans for your  listening habits ahead.  And talk about a royal snub, both President Trump  and former President Barack Obama will not be invite ted to the upcoming  royal wedding.  Why Harry and Meghan left the leader of the free world and  the last leader of the free world off the exclusive invite list.  Here to  break it all down with me, CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell, Fox  Business Network's Connell McShane and former Republican presidential  candidate, Fox News Contributor Herman Cain.  </p><p> HERMAN CAIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy to be here.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Great to see you.  </p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN ANCHOR:  Didn't get invited either to the wedding?  </p><p> CAIN:  No.  I didn't get my invitation to the wedding.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have better things to do.  I think.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes, we do.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think we all have better things to do.  And I want to just  point out, we have the futures board up right now, we have more than 200  point loss in the Dow futures.  That's off its lows in the morning.  But  all 30 Dow stocks are in the red and it is markets.  We seem to shift from  day-to-day, from one worry to another.  So what is it?  Lindsey Bell is  going to weigh in on that because again it was interest rates and  inflation, inflation data out at the bottom of the hour on the consumer  price index.  Interest rates, inflation and the Federal Reserve and then it  was to trade war with China, tariffs and now it's about Syria.  So again,  those are the three -- those are the three risks to the market that the  Wall Street Journal pointed out at the very beginning of t this year, the  Federal Reserve and monetary policy, a trade war initiated by the White  House and then geopolitical problems.  </p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Right.  And then we also have  the tech regulation which goes with the Facebook theme as well.  But I  think the first issue that you mentioned it the Fed and that has been the  biggest concern.  I think not a lot of people have been talking about it,  is that the Fed is -- they are shrinking their balance sheet.  They are  selling.  We were talking about this -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I raised my hand because I talk about it nonstop.  I talk about  it to my parents and they're sick of it.  </p><p> BELL:  Yes.  And so, you know, I think that a lot if a lot of these issues  came up a year ago and the Fed is still in the market and still supporting  risk assets, you might not have seen these big reactions and snaps in the  stock market to these news points.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Because it's so headline-driven to your point -- I mean, that's a  good point because we sometimes have to take a step back and say what are  the broader trends, what are the things we should be walking over six  months or a year but now it's six minutes.  I mean, and now it's a  presidential tweet in the morning about Syria that moves the market,  tomorrow it might be something else. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And your folks in the Republican Party need to stop spending so  much (INAUDIBLE) on money.  </p><p> CAIN:  I'm a conservative.  I vote Republican.  Let's get that straight.   Here's the thing about the market.  Don't forget.  It's very complex and  there are a lot of moving parts.  So when one part moves you've got some  other parts that are going to react.  It's still trying to find its balance  this early in the administration.  It's only been a year.  Secondly, you've  got a lot of short-term investors that are reacting to everything in the  news.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And reaction we will get today to Mark Zuckerberg's testimony,  his second day on Capitol Hill, this after he faced questions from Senators  for about five hours yesterday.  Deirdre Bolton, I love watching her down  there.  She is still on Capitol Hill.  Hey, Deirdre.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, Dagen.  Well, you said it.  This is part  of the 48 hours that the founder, CEO, and chairman of Facebook Mark  Zuckerberg is facing.  He talked about those five hours of questioning  yesterday from Senators.  Today, more to come.  The House Energy and  Commerce Committee members are going to be questioning Mr. Zuckerberg.  So  yesterday there were a few intense exchanges, let's call them that.  Here's  one of the more colorful ones from Senator John Kennedy from Louisiana.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA:  Your user agreement sucks.  The purpose  of that user agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end.  It's not to inform  your users about their rights.  Now you know that and I know that.  I'm  going to suggest to you that you go back home and rewrite it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BOLTON:  All right, Dagen.  So that had a little comedic relief there,  especially for the crowd.  Some of the Senators were more on point about  business topics.  You had Senator Lindsey Graham saying is Facebook a  monopoly and he used an analogy with a car manufacturer saying, listen, if  a car doesn't work that well consumers have other choices for car models  and, therefore, can challenge if you're basically creating a substandard  product.  So Mark Zuckerberg squirmed a little on that one, one of the  other highlight was Senator Dick Durbin saying, oh, well, I care about  privacy, where did you stay?  Where are you staying this week?  What's your  hotel address?  Who have you message?  Just underlining this difference  between personal privacy and what is open to the public.  So more to come,  Dagen.  We'll be on it.  In the meantime, back to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I can't wait for that, Deirdre.  Deirdre Bolton down in  Washington.  Was that a bomb-sniffing dog that was barking? Could you hear  it? </p><p> BOLTON:  I think so.  We have a lot of things going on here, Dagen. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There was someone in a troll costume yesterday, right?  </p><p> BOLTON:  Yes, yes, that was classic.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So, Connell tweeted about it, he said that was the highlight of  the day.</p><p> BOLTON:  You know, she stood out, she stood out and were protester as well,  saying stop stealing corporate data, the colored pink ladies.  You know,  we've had a lot of fun here, Dagen.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Deirdre, thank you for that.  Deirdre Bolton in the D.C. for us.   And joining us now is Republican Texas Congressman, House Financial Service  Committee Chairman, Jeb Hensarling.  Your reaction to the testimony by Mark  Zuckerberg yesterday, what you would like to hear from him today?  </p><p> REP. JEB HENSARLING (R), TEXAS, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE FINANCIAL SERVICE  COMMITTEE:  Well, it won't be before my committee.  We have another hearing  with the acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.  But  again, I think people need to know exactly what privacy rights should they  be able to expect.  I listened to the exchange with Senator Kennedy which  besides being -- adding a little levity, my guess is greater clarity needs  to be provided.  </p><p> I mean, too many of these privacy agreements are written in legal ease,  they're voluminous and they need to be succinct and written in English and  people have to make decision about how much of their privacy do they want  to be shared -- have shared.  And so, I think the hearings will be good.  I  think it illuminate these issues going forward and again, we're going to be  kind of be busy doing our own thing in the Financial Services Committee but  I'll keep an extra ear open for what's going on down the hall.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Well, you mentioned the hearing with the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau director, -- acting director, Mick Mulvaney.  This  actually does dovetail with the Facebook hearing because we set up this  protection bureau after the financial crisis.  What the heck have they been  doing?  Because again, protecting data on Facebook not happening.   Protecting customers at Wells Fargo, well, that was uncovered by the L.A.  Times.  What do you want to hear from Mick Mulvaney today? </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, again, you well pointed out, you wonder what's been  going on at Wells Fargo.  I mean, clearly all kinds of problems.  I mean, I  know they have new management in place but it seems like every single day  another shoe is dropping from something happening under the old management.   And you wonder why didn't we create an entire new agency that supposedly  had employees embedded in the job and they still didn't figure it out.  </p><p> There's a couple different problems with the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau.  It's -- remains the most unaccountable, most powerful Federal  agency in the history of the Republic.  That was true under Richard  Cordray, an Obama appointee .  It's true under Mulvaney, a Republican- appointee.  They're just not accountable.  There's no checks and balances.   They take their money straight from the Fed.  They're not on the  appropriations process.  </p><p> The President can only fire the head of the CFPB for cause.  The courts and  there's something called the Chevron deference have to basically put their  thumb on the scale in favor of the CFPB.  And then finally, there's not  even a them at the CFPB, there's only a him, one person can basically wake  up on the wrong side of the morning and outlaw any credit card, checking  account or mortgage he wants to.  </p><p> That is fundamentally in opposition to the American foundational value of  checks and balances and frankly, a lot of people are being denied due  process.  They are Congress, prosecutor (INAUDIBLE) judge, jury, all rolled  into one which our founders in the Federalist papers, I think it was  Federalist 47, Madison, would have called the very definition of tyranny.   So number one, they're unaccountable.  Number two, they're hurting  consumers.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> HENSARLING:  Free checking has been cut in half at banks.  There are 15  percent fewer credit cards that cost 200 basis points more.  It's much  harder for middle income Americans to find mortgages.  And so these are the  problems we have to get to.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Herman Cain has a question.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Sure.  </p><p> CAIN:  One of the things that I have heard from small bankers is that the  initial roll-out of CFP --Consumer Protection Agency, a lot of small banks  were put out of business.  We have heard that the attempts now are to roll  back some of those regulations to make it easier for small banks to  survive.  Is that in the version you are working on?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, absolutely.  And this is not fake news, Herman.  A lot  of banks and credit unions have gone out of business and a lot of them  because of Dodd-Frank large and the CFPB in specific.  And so the CFPB sets  the standards and they roll downhill.  And the big banks they have the  resources to handle this regulatory load but not the smaller banks.  And so  small bank as you probably know lend to small businesses and without that  credit channel a lot of small businesses won't be formed.  We don't know  where the next godfather's pizza will come from, if we're losing our small  community banks.  So, there is legislation that has come out to of the  House, legislation that has come out of the Senate to really help kind of  our community banks.  I hope we're going to come together, negotiate a  package soon that we can support because the community banks are just dying  on the vine.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, I do want to get your reaction to these strong  words on Syria and Russia from President Trump this morning.  He's ramping  up the rhetoric as he mulls a possible missile strike, missile strikes  against Bashar al Assad after that suspected chemical attack.  Here is just  some of what he tweeted earlier.  Russia vows to shoot down any in all  missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming,  nice new and smart.  It shouldn't be partnered with a gas-killing animal,  he kills his own people and enjoys it.  It looks like the President has  made his decision.  What's your reaction to this and partners, any allies  who act alongside us in this effort?  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Well, it's absolutely outrageous that we still in the 21st  century are seeing the use of chemical weapons.  I mean, they cannot be  allowed to do this.  And we know that the President's predecessor,  President Obama infamously drew his red line in the sand and then he let  them cross it.  And so I think what we're hearing from this president is  you're not going to be allowed to cross that line.  We are not going to  introduce chemical weapons and allow them to be used on your own people.   They are absolutely horrific and atrocious.  And so, listen, I'm not  commander-in-chief.  He's commander-in-chief.  But Syria has to get the  word, Russia has to get the word.  I hope that, again, this will be  measured.  Steps have to be taken that are necessary to ensure this does  not happen again.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Congressman, Jeff Hensarling, thank you so much for being here.  </p><p> HENSARLING:  Thank you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Breaking news.  A plane crash killing more than 250 people in  Algeria.  Cheryl Casone has the details.  Cheryl?</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR:  That's right, Dagen.  An Algerian military jet  crashed near the country's capital killing at least 257 people.  The  transport plane filled with soldiers and their families came down near a  military base shortly after takeoff.  It's not clear what caused this crash  but it is the worst plane crash in Algeria since 2003 when an Air Algerie  jet went down.  That crash killed 102.</p><p> Well, Theranos is making some major job cuts.  Reports say the blood- testing firm is laying off almost everyone that works there in an effort to  keep the company afloat and avoid bankruptcy.  The layoff chopped company's  the workforce from 125 to about two dozen.  That is way down from 2015 when  they had about 800 people there.  Their founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  has announced the staffing changes near a month after settling civil fraud  charge was the FCC which forced her to give up voting control over her own  company and pay a $500,000 fine.</p><p> Well, John Boehner, remember him?  He is getting involved in the rapidly  expanding U.S. marijuana industry.  The former Speaker of the House has  joined the advisory board of Acreage Holdings.  The company  grows and  sells marijuana in 11 states.  Boehner, a Republican went on the record  nine years ago saying he was opposed to legalizing pot.  But now he says  that his attitude towards it has changed like that of many Americans out  there.  And at least two-thirds of Americans want pot legalized according  to Gallup survey.</p><p> And then there is this.  The royal wedding just over a month away and the  invitations have been sent out.  Notable names missing from the guest list  is former President Obama, who is friends with Prince Harry.  President  Trump will also be missing from the crowd when harry ties the knot with the  next member of the royal family, American actress Meghan Markle.   Kensington Palace recently announced that no politicians will be receiving  an invite to the event and that includes, yes, this lady, U.K. Prime  Minister, Theresa May.  Tough invites if you can get it.  All right. Back  to you.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Do you really want to go if Anna Wintour is going to be there  though.  I'm just saying.  I'm guessing that she's going to be invited  potentially, so, again, I don't want to belong to any club that would have  me as a member.  That's Groucho Marx.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  That's good.  I mean, John Boehner in the pot company?  I guess  let us let that go.</p><p> CAIN:  Was he getting paid  (INAUDIBLE) it makes a difference if he's  getting a little skin in the game from being an advisory board member.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  But there's so many jokes.</p><p> BELL:  He's getting older from marijuana.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  But he is still smoking.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Cigarettes.  He was a cigarette smoker.  </p><p> CAIN:  I know.  But now, you know, he may be making an upgrade to  marijuana, who knows?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's legal in some states.  </p><p> CAIN:  Check out the statistics in Colorado before people jump on the  bandwagon.  That's all I'm saying.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What statistics, about the -- </p><p> CAIN:  About the impact of legalizing marijuana in the state.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Workplace productivity.  </p><p> CAIN:  Workplace productivity, more homelessness, seriously.  They haven't  put out all the statistics, but that's what's happening in Colorado.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  There you go.</p><p> CAIN:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Herman, I love having you here.</p><p> CAIN:  Thank you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Amazon is under fire.  Still we're breaking down a shocking  report which outlines how the retail giant avoided paying millions of  dollars in taxes last year.  Plus the FTC weighing in on those warranty  void if removed stickers.  What the Consumer Protection Agency is telling  shoppers, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  We have breaking news this morning.  Axios is reporting that  Speaker of the House Paul Ryan is expected to announce that he will not run  for re-election in November.  Maria Bartiromo when she interviewed Paul  Ryan in mid-February 13th, asked him about him running for re-election.  I  believe his response was something to the effect I need to talk to my wife  about it.  This is something I'll discuss with my wife.  But again, Axio  reporting he will not run again.  That means Paul Ryan is leaving certainly  Congress, Herman Cain, your reaction.  </p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a double hit.  Because first, he won't be in Congress,  and secondly he won't be speaker.  That means the speaker position is going  to be a toss-up.  And personally I think that the frontrunners are McCarthy  and Scalise.  Scalise projects more leadership even though you have that  unfortunate accident of being shot.  It's going to be a scramble for the  speaker's position.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  I mean, McCarthy's similar -- I mean, in terms of make-up and in  terms of who his allies would be and where his critics would be to Paul  Ryan, isn't that fair?  </p><p> CAIN:  That's a fair statement.  That's why I say it's going to be a toss- up in terms of who's going to be scrambling to try to get that position.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just feel like from John Boehner to Paul Ryan and it might be  less of a point if the Democrats manage to take back the House, then it's - - the job is quite a bit smaller for the Republican leader in the house.  </p><p> CAIN:  Memo to Dagen, they are not going to take back the House.  That's  just their rhetoric, the Democrats.  I feel very strongly about that.  I  don't feel strongly about a lot of things.  They're not going to take back  control of the House.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're raising an awful lot of money, Herman.  </p><p> CAIN:  Yes.  They tried to buy an election in Georgia with $30 million  against $8 million and the Republican won.  Why?  Because we were able to  energize the Republican voters to get out.  Money couldn't buy that seat.   This is the --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You run a bad candidate who runs a bad campaign like what  happened in Pennsylvania and the Democrats win.</p><p> CAIN:  That's a different story.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Do you think Paul Ryan being out energizes the -- if this is  true, would energize Republican basis?  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> CAIN:  I don't think -- it would energize the members that are pretty sure  they're coming back but not necessarily the voters.  The voters have got to  be energized with a very strong, very clear Republican message, which they  don't have out there right now.  The results are on their side with this  President.  But they have not taken it and crystallized their message.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I agree, all over the place, what we say down south.  Switching  gears.  The FTC says it's OK to remove those pesky warranty stickers.   Lauren Simonetti has more.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FBN REPORTER: Hey there.  The Federal Trade Commission  says these warranty void if removed sticker are B.S.  They fired off a  letter to six manufacturers -- you've seen those -- of cars, phones and  video game consoles.  This is what they wrote, \"provisions that tie  warrantee coverage to the use of particular products or services harm both  consumers, who pay more for them, as well as the small businesses who offer  competing products.  We don't know which companies were warned but think --  Sony think Microsoft as they make many of the products in question.\" </p><p> The FTC says they're breaking the law because a manufacturer can't tell a  consumer they can't fix their own stuff or that they can't have a third  party fix it.  So here's an example.  You buy a new Honda.  It breaks.  You  take it to your local mechanic.  They can't fix it and you take it back to  Honda.  The FTC says Honda cannot deny you return because you went to the  repair shop first.  That thinks to the 1975 (INAUDIBLE) consumers don't  know about this.  We don't know our rights and many companies exploit that  with those no trespassing stamps that we just showed you.  So bottom line,  do your homework.  You can take your stuff back.  This applies to Apple  iPhones, by the way, if the screen is messed up.  Usually a third party is  allowed to fix it.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  You just sounded like Lindsey Graham at the hearing yesterday  with the whole car example for a second.  Which is actually a good example  yesterday.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Lindsey Graham was pulling -- you know, he was doing that whole  southern trick.  I'm going to sound stupid but I'm going to catch you,  right?  </p><p> CAIN:  It might not be a trick with him.  I'm just saying.  Wow.  I'm just  saying it might not be.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Coming in heavy.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Somebody on Twitter just called you gentleman.  Now not so much.  </p><p> CAIN:  Oh, wow.  I don't do political correctness.  You know that.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I love having Herman Cain here.  And the message from Lauren as  those companies can stick those stickers where the sun don't shine.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p> SIMONETTI:  You're welcome.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Coming up.  A major test for Mark Zuckerberg.  How the Facebook  CEO responded to lawmakers grilling him about his company's data scandal,  next.  Plus Jim Carrey slamming the President again, the backlash over his  latest insulting tweet ahead.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Welcome back.  I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo.  It's  Wednesday, April 11th, your top stories at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.  Markets are  under pressure, we just got the numbers for last month's CPI, the consumer  price index hitting the tape.  You haven't seen much movement in the Dow  Futures right here, right now.  The month-over-month top line CPI was down  one-tenth of a percent, that was a drop that was unexpected.  But if you  look at the year-over-year number which is critical, a 2.4 percent gain on  the overall number, core CPI excluding food and energy was up 2.1 percent,  which is still a pretty hot inflation number considering what we've seen in  the last 10 years.  </p><p> And then we have rising tensions with Syria also weighing on investors in  these Markets.  Futures extending their slide after President Trump tweeted  this earlier: \"Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at  Syria.  Get ready, Russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and  smart.  You shouldn't be partners with a gas-killing animal who kills his  own people and enjoys it.\"</p><p> Checking the global market action, in Europe, we have losses across the  board.  More than a one percent loss on the DAX in Germany.  And in Asia  overnight, those markets already closed for the day, we had some mixed  markets.</p><p>Facebook not the only tech giant under fire.  New questions over Amazon and  its tax practices.  We take a closer look ahead.  And Mark Zuckerberg, the  founder of Facebook, the CEO, facing questions over bias against  conservatives.  We have viral stars Diamond and Silk reacting to the  hearing later this hour.  </p><p> And then there's deadline day, the FBI and Justice Department have until  today to turn over the unredacted memo that led to the Russia  investigation.  The initial two-page electronic memo, House Intelligence  Committee Chairman Devin Nunes threatening legal action if law enforcement  does not comply.  And is this the end?  Is it coming for Robert Mueller?   The White House weighing in on the special counsel and his future.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  I know a number of  individuals in the legal community and including at the Department of  Justice that he has the power to do so.  We've been advised that the  President certainly has the power to make that decision.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We're looking at the fallout from those comments.  And then Jim  Carrey, the so-called artist, taking aim at President Trump and Putin with  his latest piece of artwork.  The backlash ahead.  And investors tuning  into Spotify in its first week of trading.  Now, the company is looking to  keep up the success.  The big plans for your listening habits.  But first,  are special counsel Robert Mueller's days numbered?  Blake Burman joins us  from the White House with a lot more.  Blake?</p><p> BLAKE BURMAN, FBN WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, there, Dagen, good morning  to you.  After President Trump openly mused here at the White House on  Monday that some people, he says, are telling him that he should fire  Robert Mueller.  The White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said  yesterday that they do believe the President have that power.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SANDERS:  I know a number of individuals in the legal community and  including at the Department of Justice that he has the power to do so, but  I don't have any further announcements on --</p><p> REPORTER:  But it is -- they told me (INAUDIBLE) they said it's Rod  Rosenstein who oversees the special counsel, only he has the power to fire  the special counsel.</p><p> SANDER:  Again, we've been advised that the President certainly has the  power to make that decision.  I can't go anything beyond that.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  Democrats and even several Republicans on Capitol Hill though are  calling for the special counsel to be protected.  While the top Republican  on the House Intelligence Committee has his sights set elsewhere.   Congressman Devin Nunes saying last night that if he does not get an  unredacted version of the document that he says started the Russia  investigation, then he wants the head of the FBI and the number two at the  DOJ to lose their jobs.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE:   I'll just tell you that we're not going to just hold in contempt.  We will  have a plan to hold in contempt and to impeach.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  To impeach Christopher Wray?</p><p> NUNES:  Absolutely.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Rod Rosenstein?</p><p> NUNES:  We're not -- we're not messing around here.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BURMAN:  In a tweet earlier this morning, President Trump said that there  was, \"no collusion or obstruction other than I fight back.  So now they do  the unthinkable and raid a lawyer's office for information.  Bad!\"  Of  course, though, Dagen, he is referring to the raid of Michael Cohen, the  President's personal attorney.  President Trump had described that earlier  this week as a, quote, attack on our country.  In a harsh rebuke yesterday  on the Senate floor, Chuck Schumer described that assertion as a, quote,  disgrace.  Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Blake Burman, thank you for the reporting, as always.  Blake, at  the White House for us.  Now, on the Capitol Hill, Facebook's CEO Mark  Zuckerberg set to be grilled by House lawmakers today.  This, after  testifying for roughly five hours before some skeptical Senators who  demanded answers about how the social media company allowed Cambridge  Analytica to misuse the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D), ILLINOIS:  Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable  sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  No.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> DURBIN:  If you've messaged anybody this week, would you share with us the  names of the people you've messaged?</p><p> ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, no, I would probably not choose to do that publicly  here.</p><p> DURBIN:  I think that may be what this is all about, your right to privacy,  the limits of your right to privacy, and how much you give away in modern  America in the name of, quote, connecting people around the world.</p><p> KENNEDY:  Here's what everybody's been trying to tell you today.  And I say  this gently.  Your user agreement sucks.  You spot me 75 I.Q. points.  If I  can figure it out, you can figure it out.  The purpose of the user  agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end, it's not to inform your users  about their rights.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Joining me now is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of  Business, author of \"The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook,  and Google,\" Scott Galloway.  Scott, your take on Zuckerberg's performance  yesterday?</p><p> SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS:  It  was remarkable on how unremarkable it was.  He's -- you know, he's the  winner here because the bottomline is he didn't screw up.  There was a  couple of good sound bites there.  But it's nothing -- there was no real  moment.  And D.C. is the big looser.  You think 55 adults would have gotten  in a room and said we can't really do anything in four or five minutes  each.  Who knows technology, raise your hand?  Three or four people would  have raised their hand out of the 55.  And they said, why don't we give  each of you more than five minutes so you can actually drill down.  It was  the format that made this literally a useless exercise.</p><p> MCSHANE:  That's a really good point.</p><p> CAIN:  And I agree with you, 200 percent.  Absolutely.  It was remarkably  unremarkable.  Most of them knew that going in but it was the opportunity  to get five minutes on T.V.  That's all it was about.  And nothing's going  to come out of this, other than Zuckerberg is going to say, well, I'm  highly concerned about this whole, you know, screening out conservative  stuff.  We will take that under advisement.</p><p> BELL:  Yes, exactly.  I think that's a great point, Herman.  Scott, what  does Mark do after two days of testimony in front of Congress?</p><p> GALLOWAY:  He goes back to work and he does nothing, and he hires more  lobbyists, there's a lot of job (INAUDIBLE) for lobbyists, for Facebook.   The bigger -- the folks that are about to go gangster on Facebook right now  are in Europe, specifically (INAUDIBLE).  Europe in the last week has made  more progress if you will or proposed more legislation against Facebook  than America has to date.  France is talking about taxing them on their top  line because Google figured out a way to do $7 billion in revenue in the  U.K. and paid $50,000 in taxes.  They're talking about regulating Facebook  and Twitter as media companies and Britain.  Their GDRP is well ahead of  anything we're doing.  This is a nothing burger here in D.C.</p><p> MCSHANE:  See, he was told specifically -- his notes, they didn't really  leak, they were -- pictures were taken of his notes as they were left out  on t he --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The A.P. -- right, A.P. took -- the A.P. photographer got a shot  of the notes, the prep work that his lawyers had done for him.</p><p> MCSHANE:  And to Scott's point, he was talking exactly what you were  saying, he was instructed if that came up to not really say anything about  it, to not come out and say -- which is interesting, well, what would your  take would be on this, he was told apparently according to those notes,  don't say we're already doing what they're regulating in Europe, that we're  already doing that.  Apparently, it said that in his notes that he wasn't  supposed to come out and say that.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, there's been a lot of serious lies in big tech.   Information wants to be free, that was a lie.  We not only comply with the  tax laws, we comply with the spirit of the tax laws.  That was Tim Cook.   The spirit of U.S. tax laws isn't that you issue your I.P. to the isle of  man so you can suppress taxes in the U.S., high-tax domain, and increase  them in low-tax domains.  That's not the spirit of the U.S. tax law.  The  most recent big lie from big tech was Mark Zuckerberg saying, I'm not sure  we shouldn't be regulated.  I'd really like to know if the lobbyists in  D.C. representing Facebook are running around saying, you know what, we're  open to regulation.  That is so ridiculous.  They will fight tooth and nail  any regulation.</p><p> CAIN:  The only thing that Mark Zuckerberg said that I agree with, if  Congress passes regulations, as you know they're going to be too big and  too many and it's going to keep any challengers out of the marketplace  because a new start-up is going to have a tough time dealing with it.  I  agree with you.  Leave them alone.  Let the customers of Facebook decide  Facebook's future.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It was pretty clear based on the questioning that the last tech  gadget some of these senators had bought was a Playskool View-Master, that  they don't -- they have no concept of how even cell phones work quick  frankly.  You brought up taxes.  I want to bring up this issue with you,  Scott.  15 U.S. corporations including Amazon found ways to avoid taxes on  nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year.  This is a report from  the institute on taxes and economic policy.  Amazon received $137 million  rebate on $5.4 billion in profits resulting in an effective tax rate of a  negative 2-1/2 percent.  And Trump -- of course, President Trump's been  attacking Amazon for not paying enough in taxes.  But again, this kind of  goes to your point.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  We've institutionalized a regressive corporate tax structure.   Since 2008, Wal-Mart has paid $64 billion in corporate income tax, Amazon  has paid 1.4 billion.  This is despite the fact that Amazon has added a  value of Wal-Mart to its Market cap in the last three months.</p><p> So what we've effectively we -- our tax system around big tech is sort of  the Hunger Games.  If you survive it and you win, you live a fabulous life  and you can avoid taxes.  The tax system is so complex and so favors large  multinationals that it's basically a transfer of wealth from small domestic  and medium-sized companies that only have domestic operations to large  multinationals who can afford large tax departments and then can do these  sort of -- these unnatural gymnastics to figure out a way to suppress their  taxes in high-tax domains.  We have -- Amazon is about to view us -- Amazon  is about to become the most valuable company in history, and effectively  pay no tax.</p><p> So, the question becomes when the most successful company in the world  doesn't pay taxes, who does pay taxes?  And it's simple, less successful  companies pay taxes.  You know, Alexa, is this a good thing?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Absolutely.  I want to ask you, though, about with Facebook and  its future.  Do you think that the problem was -- you look at -- I was  talking to a well-known investor yesterday and he said the government just  stood back and did nothing because they have no understanding of technology  and they don't want to, quote, get in the way of innovation.  That Amazon - - that Facebook should never have been allowed to buy Instagram, for  example, that they just let the company get bigger and bigger and bigger  with no control.</p><p> GALLOWAY:  Well, going back to Herman's comments, I don't think the  revolution is going to be consumer-led.  I think consumers are lazy and  talk of big game about supply chain ethics and then want that little black  dress for 9.99 and their espresso pods delivered within 48 hours for free.   I don't think this is going to be consumer-led.  And when 280 million  Americans, 213 million of them are on Facebook, you don't really have any  choice.  In addition, when you have 5 million advertisers and no one  advertiser can really hurt you, you're a monopsony.  Advertisers have no  choice but to be on Facebook.  So, bottom line, this is a monopoly.  I  think the answer is to break these guys up, Facebook, Instagram, messenger,  WhatsApp, healthier for the economy.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can take your mic off.  Drop it.  Great for you.  That was a  drop-the-mic moment.  Scott Galloway, thank you so much.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Merger talks between Sprint and T-Mobile, reportedly back on.   Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock Exchange with more.  Nicole?</p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR:  Hey, good morning, Dagen.  So, yesterday,  we saw Sprint soaring 17 percent, T-Mobile also jumping.  So now, this is  the third time in four years that these two companies are getting together.   Last round of talks broke up at the end of November.  They've now rekindled  with the talks because they want to share the burden of investing and all  the costs that they face.  But now, it's who's going to have control.   Because you have GermanDeutsche Telekom, they're seeking control.  They  obviously are the part of the T-Mobile.  And then you have SoftBank Group  that is -- has a majority stake for Sprint.  So, this is what they're  ironing out.  But again, they're still in the early stages, so don't get  too excited.  </p><p> And the other story that is sort of the back story is that the cell tower  stocks have been under pressure because they have concerns that they might  have to cut their costs.  Let's look at Spotify.  Spotify's an exciting  story, right?  We had a direct listing, the reference price is 132.  But  now they're saying -- and they soared at the open and it's been doing  great.  Big product change, free music service that they're going to be  pushing going forward.  They have their 9.99, but Spotify is looking down  about one percent today.  And watch on April 24th, they may have a new  speaker.  They're going to have an announcement.  Back to you.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Thank you, Nicole.  Nicole Petallides at the New York Stock  Exchange.  Markets under pressure this morning over rising tensions with  Syria and of course Russia.  In a pair of tweets earlier, President Trump  threatened the Kremlin over its defense of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad  and said their relations with Russia are worse than ever.  Joining me now  is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Stuart, your thoughts?</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Well, actually, Dagen, I think the President was  tweeting and saying very clearly, here come the missiles, watch out, boys,  because they're on their way virtually.  I think we can expect a strike.  I  mean, the President has teed this up quite obviously.  We can expect a  strike in the relatively near future.  My question is how does the Market  react?  Granted, you're down 200 on Dow Futures at the moment as you run up  to the in expected strike but what happens when the strike takes place?   Does the market fall some more or does it recover?  </p><p> I remember in times past when as soon as the missiles are fired off, the  Market goes up.  It goes down as you wait for the fire.  And then it goes  up when they've been fired.  I wonder if the same thing will happen this  time.  I think a lot depends on the extent of the missile hit, whether  Russian and/or Iranians get killed in the hit, and any possibility that  they'll be followed up with more later?  I think the market reaction  depends on that.  But I would not be surprised to see a move up when those  missiles are launched.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  This is President Trump using Twitter in the best way, to  communicate very forcefully and directly.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And people always wring their hands and nash about how Trump is  on Twitter so much.  But this, you can't get more direct and powerful than  the statements he made just out.</p><p>VARNEY:  It's immediate, isn't it?  I mean, it's flat-out immediate.  He  comes -- he tweets, and you know full well that the Russians are waiting  for the tweet.  They're not waiting for a statement from the State  Department, they're looking for the tweet.  And reliably, here it is.  By  the way, I hope I'm not offending my friend there, Scott Galloway.  I know  what a socialist he is.  I know how he obviously dislikes the whole idea of  American military adventures overseas.  I don't want to upset the guy in  the middle of your show, OK?  I just want that to be very clear.</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  OK.  I love you, Stuart.  You're on in nine minutes.  We'll be  right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  This breaking news right here, right now.  House Speaker Paul  Ryan will announce today that he will not run for re-election and he will  retire at the end of the year.  He plans to tell the GOP House members  today that he will not seek re-election.  Herman, your take on this.</p><p> CAIN:  Well, it's a loss for the Republicans to lose that seat.  But they  might hold the seat but secondly, it means a change in leadership for the  Republicans in the House.  And to be honest with you, that may not be a bad  thing.  Because when Ryan was running for the speaker's position, there  were a number of people vying for it.  So, it's going to open up the  competition for people who really want to be in that.  And secondly, I  happen to believe that Ryan may have just said I've had enough.  You can't  imagine the pressure that you are under to try to basically herd 245 cats  uphill and that's just the Republican side, in order to get something done.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  The thing about what happened just last year, in President  Trump's first year in office, the House got an Obamacare fix passed, what  would have been a giant fix of Medicaid.  What did the Senate do with it?   Gave it a thumbs down.  Paul Ryan, clearly, when Maria interviewed him in  mid-February, he was very clearly upset about that no-vote from Senator  John McCain.  Then they got the tax reform through, which I've been a  naysayer among many, I didn't think they would be able to get it done, that  he would be able to accomplish that.  So, he has that huge win under his  belt, time to hit the bricks.</p><p> CAIN:  He is leaving with a grand slam homerun under his belt and that is  the tax cuts and jobs plan, you're absolutely right.  So, it's going to be  will be a horse race.</p><p> MCSHANE:  There's a number of conservatives though -- no secret -- that  aren't big fans of Paul Ryan.  That said, he did -- he did raise a lot of  money for all the criticism that came in from him for the base.  So,now you  have a dynamic right in the midterm election where the speaker has already  apparently going to announce that he's not running.  That's your main  fundraiser, too, that's kind of out of the game, and kind of the backdrop  of everything else that's going on.  You'll have a run for Republican  leadership.  I wonder how it affects the dynamic, I guess is the -- is the  main question.</p><p> CAIN:  It will be interesting.  I think we'll have to wait and see.   Because that is a major, major change with respect to the dynamics of  politics for 2018.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I do want to point out that there was a report out that --  of the Republicans who were expected to have dinner with President Trump  tonight, House Speaker Paul Ryan being one of them, Kevin McCarthy, John  Cornyn, and Mitch McConnell will be -- we'll see if the dinner plan is  changed, but again, it -- I wonder if this actually helps bring enthusiasm  at the base.  Paul Ryan's not the most well-liked people --</p><p> CAIN:  I would agree, 50 percent of the base was not that enthusiastic  about his leadership.  So, it could possibly bring some enthusiasm to the  base.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I didn't -- think it's safe to say he wasn't as hated as John  Boehner.</p><p> CAIN:  Oh, no, no, no, no.

How hard? A sextet of well-known techs -- Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Facebook and Netflix -- have lost a collective $1.1 trillion from their all-time highs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These companies, which some have dubbed the Fab 6, bounced back a bit with the overall market Wednesday. But they are in a correction, down more than 10% from recent peaks. </p><p>In fact, several of them are even in bear market territory -- 20% or more below their highs.</p><p>Investors are clearly reevaluating whether the tech sector, which has led the market's surge for the past few years, deserves to remain a leader on Wall Street.</p><p>There are growing concerns that demand for high-priced gadgets like Apple's (AAPL) iPhones are beginning to slow. </p><p>Several iPhone suppliers have recently warned of weak sales and Bloomberg reported Wednesday that China's Foxconn Technology Group, which makes iPhones for Apple, is planning significant cost cuts next year. coo</p><p>Foxconn Technology Group would neither confirm nor deny the Bloomberg story, saying in a statement to CNN Business that it regularly reviews its global operations and that \"the review being carried out by our team this year is no different than similar exercises carried out in past years.\" </p><p>There's a growing possibility of more government regulations on tech -- particularly advertising based companies such as Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL). </p><p>Amazon's (AMZN) increased clout in retail, cloud computing and media has some wondering if the company could eventually find itself the target of antitrust investigations around the globe, similar to Microsoft (MSFT) back in the late 1990s. </p><p>Finally, there's the simple matter of whether or not the big tech companies deserve their lofty valuations. Amazon and Netflix (NFLX) each trade for about 60 times 2019 earnings forecasts -- a huge premium to the broader market.</p><p>Big slide leads to buying opportunities</p><p>So what's next for the tech sector? </p><p>Dave Smith, senior vice president of domestic equities with Bailard, said the recent slide has led to the proverbial case of babies being thrown out with the bathwater -- panic selling that has led to \"particularly stark punishment\" for some top tech stocks.</p><p>\"There are a lot of attractive growth stocks that are now trading at steep discounts,\" Smith said. \"These are the ones that we want to own.\"</p><p>Smith, who is also the subadviser for the Nationwide Bailard Technology and Science Fund, said that semiconductor stocks in particular are looking like good values. </p><p>According to Morningstar, that fund had chip leaders Texas Instruments (TXN), Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) among its top 25 holdings at the end of October. The fund's top five holdings were Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Alphabet and Cisco (CSCO).</p><p>Adam Phillips, director of portfolio strategy at EP Wealth Advisors, also said it might be time to go shopping in the tech sector. </p><p>Phillips said it's still \"too early to sound the all clear\" on volatility but he noted that he recently bought some Amazon shares because he thinks there was \"indiscriminate selling\" in the stock in the past few weeks.</p><p>There's another reason why tech may rebound too. More mergers could be on the horizon, especially if earnings growth and the economy start to slow.</p><p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities, said in a recent report that the sell-off in software stocks in particular may lead to more deals, especially in the lucrative cloud computing market. To that end, IBM (IBM) just plunked down $34 billion for Red Hat. </p><p>And Ives noted that Alphabet, which just hired away Oracle's (ORCL) cloud guru Thomas Kurian to lead Google Cloud, could now be \"on the war path\" for cloud deals in order to compete more effectively with Microsoft and Amazon. </p><p>So 2019 could be the year that big tech companies start to put even more of their gigantic cash hoards to use for acquisitions. </p><p>CNN's Jordan Valinsky contributed to this report.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Sign up here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Are we witnessing the end of a mania?</p><p>  Investors, always willing to believe in technology companies, spent the last three years piling into the shares of companies like <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon and Netflix with special abandon. Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.</p><p>  Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.</p><p>  Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we've seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company's data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>won't be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.</p><p>  Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.</p><p>Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla's ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla's bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.</p><p>  Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap's initial public offering.</p><p>  But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies. But after the Uber incident in Arizona, those companies may take a more realistic look at what they have to spend to create a technology that is efficient and safe, and conclude that they have to pull out of the race or pare back. Users of social media and regulators may prevent social media companies from sharing so much of their data with advertisers, and that could restrain revenue growth.</p><p>  And if the passion for two or three big tech companies wanes, the cooling may spread.</p><p>  -- Peter Eavis</p><p>Amazon has shed more than $50 billion in market value.</p><p>  The reason?</p><p>  Reports that President Trump wants to rein in the e-commerce giant.</p><p>  Jonathan Swan of Axios, citing anonymous sources, reported:</p><p>  ''Trump has talked about changing Amazon's tax treatment because he's worried about mom-and-pop retailers being put out of business.''</p><p>  Mr. Swan added:</p><p>  ''Trump's wealthy friends tell him Amazon is destroying their businesses. His real estate buddies tell him -- and he agrees -- that Amazon is killing shopping malls and brick-and-mortar retailers.''</p><p>  Shares of Amazon have tumbled more than 7 percent at one point Wednesday, but they pared those losses after a White House official told Reuters there were no specific policy changes related to Amazon being considered at the moment. But the official added that the administration is always looking at different options on a range of policy issues.</p><p>  How concerned should investors be?</p><p>  GBH Insights analyst Daniel Ives writes:</p><p>  ''While it's now a hand holding time for Amazon given this new regulatory potential threat, we believe the reality of these worries altering the company's business model and future tax structure are low and we would be buyers of the name on weakness.''</p><p>  Guess which companies are benefiting from Amazon's woes? Retailers, the FT points out.</p><p>  On a day when the stocks on Wall Street are flat, Macy's was up 3.5 percent, J.C. Penney has gained 5.5 percent, Walmart rose 1.7 percent, Target increased 1.8 percent, and Kohl's was up 2.4 percent.</p><p>  Are investors waking up to Tesla's real problem?</p><p>  The electric carmaker's shares are down 7 percent Wednesday, after plunging 8 percent on Tuesday.</p><p>  Tuesday's slide was driven, in part, by the National Transportation Safety Board's announcement that it was investigating a fatal crash last week involving a Tesla vehicle in California. News that JaguarLand Rover was teaming up with Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo unit probably didn't help either.</p><p>  But the continued decline in Tesla's stock -- its shares are down more than 20 percent since mid-March -- speaks to the bigger concern surrounding Tesla: How it funds itself.</p><p>  Investors have grown increasingly worried as Tesla burns through cash and struggles to meet its own production goals for the Model 3. Late Tuesday, Moody's downgraded Tesla's credit rating further into junk territory and said its outlook on the company is negative. The credit ratings agency cited production delays and said Tesla may soon need to raise more than $2 billion.</p><p>  Those concerns can be seen not just in Tesla's stock price but also in the trading of its debt. The FT points out that ''Tesla's eight-year bond maturing in 2025 traded on Wednesday at 87.6 cents to the dollar, the lowest since issuance. The yield has surged to 7.5 percent from 6.59 percent on Monday.''</p><p>  Liam Denning of Bloomberg Gadfly writes:</p><p>  ''Challenges on the factory floor and the balance sheet are converging. Drawing inexorably closer to a refinancing wall, Tesla needs a real shot of confidence, and capital, to keep its money machine turning over this year.</p><p>  ''Given Tuesday's bond blowout, that almost certainly means tapping the equity market again. Nothing like being a motivated seller to put a floor under a stock price, right?''</p><p>  Is Twitter vulnerable to privacy regulation?</p><p>  The fallout from <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>Cambridge Analytica scandal has spread to Twitter.</p><p>  The stock tumbled 12 percent Tuesday after Citron Research's Andrew Left said he was betting against the social media company because of its vulnerability to regulation around how it handles user data.</p><p>  But analysts at Barclays disagree. They argue in a recent note to clients that Twitter's data business likely won't be impacted much by any regulation on its use of user data. </p><p>  Meet Equifax's new C.E.O.</p><p>  The credit reporting company named Mark Begor, a private equity executive who once led General Electric's credit card business, as its new chief executive.</p><p>  Mr. Begor, 59, takes over for Paulino do Rego Barros Jr., who has filled the role on an interim basis since September, when Richard F. Smith stepped down after a data breach exposed sensitive personal information, including Social Security numbers, of 148 million people.</p><p>  Mr. Begor will start at Equifax on April 16.</p><p>  About Mr. Begor</p><p>   The 59-year-old is a managing director at the private equity firm Warburg Pincus. He is also a member of the board at the credit-scoring company FICO.</p><p>   Mr. Begor spent 35 years at General Electric, where his duties included leading the conglomerate's real-estate investment and energy management units. For nine years, he was president and chief executive of the company's consumer credit business, which was later spun off as Synchrony Financial.</p><p>  His pay package</p><p>  Equifax said it would give Mr. Begor stock and options valued at $17 million this year and an annual salary and bonus of up to $4.5 million.</p><p>  Why the first Trump trade deal may not lead to others</p><p>  President Trump has scored a significant trade deal with South Korea.</p><p>  But with Mr. Trump preparing to meet with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un -- who just took an armored train trip to Beijing -- and the North apparently pressing on with nuclear developments, an ''America first'' trade stance was far from the only thing pushing the South to sign. More from Michael D. Shear and Alan Rappeport:</p><p>  The political success of the trade agreement -- and its ability to be replicated in other negotiations -- is not guaranteed. Many countries have reacted coolly to Washington's pugilistic approach to trade, viewing the president's preference to punch first and negotiate later as counter to global interests.</p><p>  The Trump administration continues to ramp up its trade rhetoric with China. Unidentified sources told Bloomberg that it is considering invoking an emergency law to restrict Chinese investments in sensitive U.S. tech. A separate plan to enact tariffs on $60 billion of Chinese goods has left companies wondering which industries will be targeted. Other Asian countries increasingly fear being caught in the crossfire of a trade war, the WSJ reports.</p><p>  And nations are already reacting to Trump's trade moves, erecting  barriers to stop the steel and aluminum that faces tariffs in the U.S. being dumped in their markets.</p><p>  Against this background, NXP sold its 40 percent stake in a Chinese joint venture on chip design.</p><p>  A reality check for tech?</p><p>  Companies like <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Amazon and Alphabet have delivered some of the best returns to investors in recent years, powered by the achievements and the promise of social media and artificial intelligence.</p><p>  But that confidence is evaporating, as investors brace for intensified regulatory scrutiny across the industry. Tech stocks took a pummeling yesterday and in early European trading.</p><p>Twitter dropped 12 percent after Andrew Left's Citron Research said it was shorting the company.</p><p>  Critic's corner: The ''sector's growing clout over everyday life also raises the risks of what can go wrong,'' Dan Gallagher argues at WSJ's Heard on the Street.</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg will face the music</p><p>  The public outcry over <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>data and privacy settings has grown loud enough that Mark Zuckerberg now says he's willing to testify to Congress. The company is on a hiring spree for lobbyists, too, and unnamed sources say it's putting off the promotion of new home products.</p><p>  The man who started all this, the Cambridge Analytica whistle-blower Christopher Wylie, spoke to British lawmakers on Tuesday and revealed that an employee of Palantir Technologies had suggested that Cambridge Analytica build an app to gain access to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>networks. Palantir was co-founded by Peter Thiel, who sits on the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>board.</p><p>  Separately, New Zealand's privacy commissioner has accused <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>of breaking a law by refusing to give a man information about him held in other users' accounts. Fair housing groups are suing over ad targeting, saying <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>still lets advertisers discriminate.

Its shares dropped 7.8 percent.</p><p>  Here's Roger Lanctot, an automotive technology analyst with Strategy Analytics:</p><p>  Nvidia has no choice but to take steps in the context of the fear, uncertainty and outrage likely to be stimulated by a robot car killing a human being.

Now the intellectual underpinnings of the tech rally are being seriously tested.</p><p>Stocks in the best-known tech companies have plunged in recent days. The NYSE FANG+ index, which tracks the share price of 10 companies, including <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Apple and Amazon, has fallen nearly 14 percent from its recent high. Given that the index has soared 50 percent in just the past 12 months, the recent decline could just be the sort of sell-off that punctuates any long-term rally.</p><p>Still, several large tech companies suddenly face challenges that could undermine their ability to transform whole industries. And as we\u2019ve seen after previous fervors, investors can take a long time to regain their faith.</p><p><person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is down 20 percent from its recent high. Most of the slide came after news reports showing how the company\u2019s data was misused. Investors have to grapple with the possibility that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>won\u2019t be sharing as much data as it does, undermining its ability to generate ever-increasing amounts of advertising revenue.</p><p>Nvidia, a computer chip maker intent on being a leader in automated driving technology, is off 12 percent from its recent high. The company said on Tuesday that it would halt tests of its autonomous driving technology on public roads after an Uber self-driving car hit and killed a pedestrian in Arizona.</p><p>Tesla is not a tech stock, but it is included in the FANG+ index, and its supporters believe deeply in its power to revolutionize the auto industry. Growing fears about Tesla\u2019s ability to finance its expansion have helped drag its stock down 33 percent from its recent high. Ominously, the price of Tesla\u2019s bonds is also falling, signaling that the company is losing the confidence of creditors.</p><p>Of course, on their march higher, tech stocks overcame obstacles, like management problems at Uber and the poor performance of Snap\u2019s initial public offering.</p><p>But the latest problems have raised deeper, broader doubts, and that may keep the uncertainty around longer. Investors have viewed automated driving technology as a huge potential source of growth for some companies.

I`m Bianna Golodryga with John Dickerson, Gayle King and Norah O`Donnell.</p><p>Well, some victims of California`s worst-ever wildfire are asking why the state`s largest utility didn`t shut off power in areas that weren`t high risk. The death toll from the Camp Fire is now up to seventy-seven. Nearly one thousand other people are unaccounted for. In eleven days, the fire has destroyed more than ten thousand homes north of Sacramento.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: Pacific Gas and Electric now says two of its power lines failed in areas where the fire broke out a short time before the first flames were reported. It highlighted one failure the day the fire began, but then waited more than a week to report the second until more information was available. PG&amp;E says the fire forecast did not meet the criteria for a public safety power shutoff. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p><p>GAYLE KING: More than sixty-four hundred firefighters are battling California`s two largest wildfires right now. Fire crews have faced five of the ten most destructive fires in state history in the past thirteen months. DeMarco Morgan is in Paradise, California, with the personal toll for the men and the women on the front lines. DeMarco, good morning.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN (CBS News Correspondent): Gayle, good morning to you. We have seen the devastating pictures coming out of Paradise, but I want you to take a look at this right here. This was once the home that once belonged to Cal Fire Captain Joe Chavez. You can see it`s in complete ruins. You can barely even make out the layout out of the place. And after speaking with several firefighters on yesterday, many of them who have been fighting fires across the state for the past couple of months, this is proof that it`s taken more than just a physical toll on their bodies.</p><p>(Begin VT)</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: It`s dinner time at this Cal Fire command center in Chico, California, a chance for firefighters here to slow down.</p><p>CHAD FARRIS (Liberty Fire): Hi, baby.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: For Chad Farris, it`s a time to see his infant daughter`s face.</p><p>CHAD FARRIS: I got out of the military last June, started the next day with Liberty and been going on fires ever since.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: Farris is just one of the thousands of firefighters battling flames across the state during a year in which fires chewed through more than 1.5 million acres of land, an area larger than Rhode Island.</p><p>BEN HOLLIDAY (Cal Fire Butte Company): Fire seasons don`t seem to end these days.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: Ben Holliday and Joshua Wilkins have been moving from fire to fire since June.</p><p>JOSHUA WILKINS (Cal Fire Butte Company): And I hit all the major fires in California and then figured, you know, come November we`d be done. It`s a lot, you know. Family life is very difficult, personal life is difficult, and just, you know, our personal well-being is-- is stressed by the job we do.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: Both men are from Butte County where the Camp Fire has devastated their community.</p><p>BEN HOLLIDAY: This is our home. We both-- everyone on our task force that we`re on has family here, houses gone and what not. So, yeah, this one definitely hit home more than any fire I`ve ever been on. Hands down.</p><p>JOE CHAVEZ (Cal Fire Captain): I pulled into our driveway and our house was on fire.</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: Cal Fire Captain Joe Chavez helped his wife and two young daughters evacuate before watching his home in Paradise burn down.</p><p>JOE CHAVEZ: That`s-- that was definitely hard to watch, and-- and there`s still a lot of feelings I need to deal with-- with that. I`m just glad to have my-- my family whole because there`s a lot of families out there that are not whole right now. There`s a lot of people that still haven`t been found. Knowing that there are people out there that don`t have a family anymore, that hurts.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>DEMARCO MORGAN: We`re so grateful for all of the firefighters out there risking their lives to save and protect all of us out here. And it is worth noting that there are so many of them working around the clock, that there are reportedly fifteen hundred inmates, prison inmates, also working in the field. And they are reportedly being paid two dollars an hour, but we are grateful. Again, grateful for everyone`s job and sacrifice out here. Bianna.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA: In a moment of crises, people really coming together. It`s important that we did this piece to-- to honor these firefighters. DeMarco, thank you.</p><p>Well, in a rare move, President Trump says he made a mistake by not going to Arlington National Cemetery for Veterans Day. He passed up the traditional visit a week ago, the day the holiday was observed after returning from France just hours earlier.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP (Fox News): I should have done that. I was extremely busy on calls for the country. We did a lot of calling, as you know.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE (Fox News): But this is Veterans Day.</p><p>PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I probably, you know, in retrospect I should have and I did last year and I will virtually every year. But we had come in very late at night and I had just left, literally, the American Cemetery in Paris. And I really probably assumed that was fine and I was extremely busy because of affairs of state, doing other things.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Never too busy to take care of them.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA: No. Well, the President actually missed last year`s Veterans Day ceremony because he was on a trip to Asia. He has gone to Arlington on Memorial Day the last two years. The President also rejected criticism for not visiting an American military cemetery-- cemetery in France in the rain. He insists the Secret Service vetoed the trip because of the weather.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Apple CEO Tim Cook is defending his company`s partnership that makes Google the iPhone`s default search engine. Cook has publicly criticized companies that gather massive amounts of data on users like Google and Facebook. He calls privacy a, quote, \"Core value of Apple.\" Well, in an interview with Axios on HBO, Cook said the Google deal is about user experience.</p><p>TIM COOK (Axios on HBO): I think their search engine is the best and that`s-- that`s very important. But two: look at what we`ve done with the controls that we`ve built in. And so we have private web browsing, right? We have an intelligent tracker prevention. And so what we`ve tried to do is come up with ways to help our users through their course of the day. It-- it is not a perfect thing. I`d be the very first person to say that. But it goes a long way to helping.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Hmm. Cook also said that while he is not a fan of regulation, it is, quote, \"inevitable\" that the tech industry will face it in some capacity. And I think he`s right about that.</p><p>GAYLE KING: He`s one of the most thoughtful CEOs out there--</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: He-- I know.</p><p>GAYLE KING: --in terms of what he feels about his company and what he feels about his consumer and trying to do the right thing.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Look, this is the question facing those in Silicon Valley.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Do they have a moral obligation--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Yes.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: --as well? And-- and Tim Cook seems to understand that better--</p><p>GAYLE KING: Exactly.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: --than any of the leaders out there that they do have somewhat of a moral obligation in terms of the technology that they employ and that so many of us use.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Exactly right.</p><p>BIANNA GOLODRYGA: And there`s no doubt there`s growing tension between big tech giants, specifically Facebook and Apple.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm. And he seems to think your morals are not up for grabs here.</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Right.</p><p>GAYLE KING: I like that (INDISTINCT).</p><p>Fireworks shot into a crowd after a hot-air balloon accident. Ahead, the dramatic explosion that sent people really running from danger at a festival.</p><p>And our Doctor Tara Narula`s in the Toyota Greenroom, there she is, with what you need to know about a widespread recall of ground turkey and how to keep yourself safe from salmonella this Thanksgiving. It could be an issue.</p><p>But first, it`s eight-oh-nine, time to check your local weather.</p><p>(LOCAL WEATHER BREAK)</p><p>(ANNOUNCEMENTS)</p><p>NORAH O`DONNELL: Dramatic video shows the moment a hot-air balloon full of fireworks exploded over a crowd in Southeast Asia. At least nine people were hurt when the forty pounds of pyrotechnics unexpectedly detonated in midair. Blasting fireworks torched the crowd. It happened at a festival last week in Myanmar, also known as Burma. People launch unmanned balloons often made of bamboo and paper as part of a festival of lights. This event has a troubled history. Four people were reportedly killed in a similar incident in 2014. My goodness. That seems dangerous.</p><p>JOHN DICKERSON: Yeah.</p><p>GAYLE KING: Mm-Hm.
