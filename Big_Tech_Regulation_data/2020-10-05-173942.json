The lawsuit claims that the search giant suspended her ads for six hours after the first Democratic debate. The New York Times[1] notes that for a brief time following the debate, Gabbard was the most-searched candidate on Google. Her campaign, Tulsi Now Inc claims that had the ads not been pulled, her website might have wound up on the top of the search results. The lawsuit[2] also alleges that campaign emails were being filtered into people's spam folders more than other candidates. Google confirmed that it had pulled Gabbard's advertising for a short time. It explained that algorithms had automatically flagged an increase in spending. This spike constitutes \"unusual activity,\" and the ads were temporarily suspended to prevent fraud. TULSI2020: In the hours following the 1st debate, while millions of Americans searched for info about Tulsi, Google suspended her search ad account w/o explanation.

For instance, the filing claims that Gabbard's emails were getting filtered as spam more than other candidates but provides no explanation or proof on how it came to this conclusion. Additionally, buying a ton of ads because Gabbard was trending, thus triggering fraud algorithms seems like a misstep from the campaign rather than on Google's part.Image credit: Sheila Fitzgerald[8] via Shutterstock Related Reads  Share this article:        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/81150-democratic-dark-horse-tulsi-gabbard-files-censorship-lawsuit.html#Share;\">https://www.techspot.com/news/81150-democratic-dark-horse-tulsi-gabbard-files-censorship-lawsuit.html#Share;</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81150-democratic-dark-horse-tulsi-gabbard-files-censorship-lawsuit.html...le=Democratic%20dark%20horse%20Tulsi%20Gabbard%20files%20censorship%20lawsuit%20against%20Google\">https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/81150-democratic-dark-horse-tulsi-gabbard-files-censorship-lawsuit.html...le=Democratic%20dark%20horse%20Tulsi%20Gabbard%20files%20censorship%20lawsuit%20against%20Google</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/tulsi-gabbard-sues-google.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/technology/tulsi-gabbard-sues-google.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1510-complaint-tulsi-now-v-google/7394d92b6540191c57c5/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/1510-complaint-tulsi-now-v-google/7394d92b6540191c57c5/optimized/full.pdf#page=1</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9\">https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444505090629633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444505090629633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tulsi?src=hash..._src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tulsi?src=hash..._src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9\">https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444509733720064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">https://twitter.com/TulsiGabbard/status/1154444509733720064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/san-francisco-ca-june-01-2019-1414003730\">https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/san-francisco-ca-june-01-2019-1414003730</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881156408964251425176900146</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-J6S1-F03R-N4CR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"643\"/><timeReceived>9:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 25, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000DFJZ</classCode><className>NOW INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Additionally, buying a ton of ads because Gabbard was trending, thus triggering fraud algorithms seems like a misstep from the campaign rather than on Google's part.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-24779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WND-J321-DYDW-70JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 26, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000DFJZ</classCode><className>NOW INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

By the time it got to the imaginary friends question launching off the recently in the news relationship between Ellen DeGeneres and the once toxically unpopular George W. Bush, late night hosts must have been screaming at their writers for not thinking of that for their monologues.</p><p>Even small screen addict <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</url> must have zoned out and decided tonight to center his Twitter ire on House Intelligence Committee chair Adam Schiff instead of those out for his job.</p><p>In case you didn't know, appearing tonight at Ohio's Otterbein University were, in alphabetical order, ex-VP Biden, Senator Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind, ex-HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii; Senator Kamala Harris, Senator Amy Klobuchar, ex-Congressman and Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke, Vermont's Sanders, long time impeachment advocating businessman Tom Steyer, Sen. Warren and former tech executive Andrew Yang.</p><p>Following an anti-climactic Capitol Hill press conference from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and another fiery prologue by DNC boss Tom Perez, Elizabeth Warren came on stage to the largest applause of the 12 contenders. In a tightly run show on the Jeff Zucker-run outlet, only Mayor Pete garnered a similar roar, which may tell you a lot of how enthusiastic Democrats are about their own candidates.</p><p>Familiar domestic policy for Democrats like healthcare, taxing the rich, damning Amazon and Facebook, reproductive rights were on the agenda from CNN moderators <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/anderson-cooper/\">Anderson Cooper</url> and Erin Burnett and the NYT's National Editor Marc Lacey as was a dollop of foreign policy. Still, with a new face like the soon forgotten Steyer and the absence of hecklers for once, fundamentally this debate was like every other debate the Democrats have had this year. The wannabes tried to punch up and Warren, Sanders, and ex-Vice-President Biden held the top spots - which to quote Johnny Rotten was just boring.</p><p>It was also a truly kamikaze outcome in fast moving times and a failure of the format, once again.</p><p>On a stage stuffed with more candidates that any previous debate, the rules gave each participant 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for their responses and rebuttals and a swift 15 seconds for clarification - which is not a debate by any measure. It's a slug match of pitches looking for cracks to shine some policy or personality sunshine through or to paraphrase, Sen. Sanders, it is \"the same old same old.\"</p><p>The fact is America and the world right now are not the same old same old.</p><p>Since the last time the contenders to replace Trump gathered on September 24 the incumbent has been tangled in an impeachment inquiry after leaning on the Ukrainian leadership to dig up dirt on Biden and his family.</p><p>Add to the pedal to the speed metal of American politics in 2019, the blast radius from Trump's heavy handedness has permeated almost every aspect of the Executive branch, the Massachusetts Senator has taken the lead in the polls and in fundraising. Also, 78-year old Sen. Sanders had that health scare two week ago, the ex-Celebrity Apprentice host dropped the Kurds into the jaws of Erdogan's Turkey and upended the Middle East, and a trade deal with China may or may not be happening.</p><p>Even with Tuesday's debate dragging out, the volcanic nature of those occurrences received relatively short shrift. It is not hyperbole to say that America is in the cultural equivalent of Stranger Things' Upside Down. Yet, tonight's grouping skipped along like it was just another laugh track filled sitcom, if you know what I mean?</p><p>Here's a couple of suggestions - Three hours should be one so America will truly tune in and what candidates say will have urgency. Secondly, the leashes need to be removed so people who want to be the Commander-in-chief can show if they are truly leaders or if they are just looking for a promotion.</p><p>Yes, peppered with promos for the new season of Amazon's Jack Ryan and a pharmacy full of medical ads, many railing against Democrats' various healthcare plans, tonight's occasionally awkward event had a nice moment or two like when Bernie Sanders jokingly asking Joe Biden \"are you suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin?\" The two old warriors laughed and hugged it, but for the most part, this was tightly scripted knife fighting with what have become blunt blades.</p><p>Even the jousting competition that served as the takeaway from previous loyal opposition shindigs didn't really see anyone land a blow that mattered this time. Though he put his foot in his mouth telling Warren contemptuously she did \"a good job doing your job\" at the Obama Era's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Biden stayed out of trouble on his son Hunter's big board membership in Ukraine when his Dad was VP. In her own lane, Warren never really had to do any math for her many plans despite everyone trying to whip out their calculators.</p><p>Or as one veteran Presidential debate watcher noted:</p><p>It's a moment he knew was coming. Did Biden's answer to the question about his son strike you as defensive or strong?</p><p>- Dan Rather (@DanRather) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DanRather/status/1184263156169789440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2019</url></p><p>Additionally, Cory Booker reminded us he was a vegan, Kamala Harris reminded us she was a prosecutor and a lot of the gang took politically na\u00efve turns reminding us that Warren's clearly popular desire to enact medicare for all and hobble Wall Street won't work ... well, that didn't work.</p><p>In that vein, my colleague Ted Johnson notes that: O'Rourke had perhaps the sharpest criticism of Warren, calling her policies \"punitive.\" She said that she is \"really shocked by the idea that someone thinks I'm punitive.\" I'm wondering if she's suggesting that this is a form of sexism - she sounds scolding because she is a woman.</p><p>A big favorite with both Silicon Valley and Hollywood, California's junior Senator sought to cut her colleague Warren on \"holding big tech accountable\" and backing Twitter shutting down Trump's much used feed. It was a noble lunge for a breakout but shut down fairly fast by Warren, who recently pulled a fast one on Facebook and its policy of letting ads full of clear untruths go online by posting an ad of her own nakedly full of untruths</p><p>It's rare for a leading candidate to have a breakout moment but Warren got very close tonight in denying the single digit polling Harris the spotlight.</p><p>Without naming Harris or Biden directly, Senator Warren rhetorically proclaimed \"if people are taking money from the big tech executives, if we are going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. In full flight, Warren added: \"if we are going to talk about Wall Street and having serious regulations over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.\"</p><p>That was kind of it for Kamala Harris tonight, who is beyond waning in this race.</p><p>The next time the Democrats debate on November 20 at a MSNBC and Washington Post hosted event, the pack will be sliced down. Losing one or two faint hopers won't make the outcome any more unwieldy and increasingly unwatchable - AKA, more of the same old same old, which is what Donald Trump swarmed in 2016 and could again next year at this low voltage rate.</p><p>As for the rest of tonight, well Sen Warren is adding on to those 70,000 selfies that she says many be the new measure of democracy. Hopefully the pics will be better than that canned line:</p><p>I just got off the <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DemDebate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DemDebate</url> stage and I'm ready to celebrate with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/TeamWarren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TeamWarren</url>, taking selfies with the people building our grassroots movement.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/i22cdgJ1ko\">https://t.co/i22cdgJ1ko</url></p><p>- Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1184305726891712512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 16, 2019</url></p><p>More from Deadline</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/democratic-debate-facebook-elizabeth-warren-1202761256/\">Democratic Candidates Differ On Ways To Rein In Facebook, Other Big Tech Firms</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/the-daily-show-with-trevor-noah-breaks-down-the-democratic-debate-on-twitter-1202761174/\">'The Daily Show With Trevor Noah' Unpacks The Democratic Debate</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2019/10/pete-buttigieg-beto-orourke-gun-plan-1202761227/\">Pete Buttigieg, Beto O'Rourke Trade Jabs Over Gun Reform Plans At Democratic Debate</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DEDLNE-1202761143</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEDLNE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8W-3VV1-DYJW-X2HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434846</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1481\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deadline</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26325\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

By comparison, Hillary Clinton lost the traditional Republican strongholds of Arizona and Georgia by 3.5 percentage points and 5 percentage points respectively.</p><p>And last year, every Ohio Democrat running a statewide race lost, except for senator Sherrod Brown, who won re-election and nearly used that victory to run for president on the strength of his ability to win as a populist in the Rust Belt. That same year Democrats won governorships in Wisconsin and Michigan after losing the states to Trump in 2016. </p><p>Some Ohio Democrats insist the state is still in play for Democrats, noting Trump's unpopularity here.

A little too eager, if you ask some Senate Democrats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wednesday s Senate Commerce Committee hearing the first in a series of meetings to craft the first comprehensive federal legislation on data privacy saw executives from Google, Amazon, Apple, and three other major tech firms all express support for impending congressional action on privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But in the wake of onerous new rules out of Europe and California's recent passage of an aggressive new privacy law, several Senate Democrats displayed a clear distrust of Big Tech s motives. To them, Big Tech s newfound desire for federal privacy rules represents little more than a cynical ploy to preempt tougher rules in the states and overseas. And the lawmakers are warning tech executives to think twice before playing that game.</p><p> I understand that from the standpoint of some of these companies, the holy grail is preemption,  said Sen. Brian Schatz.  And I want you to understand that you re only going to get there if this is a meaningful bill. </p><p> You re not going to get 60 votes for anything, and replace a progressive California law however flawed that you think it is with a nonprogressive federal law,  Schatz added.</p><p>Lawmakers have introduced a slew of data-privacy bills over the past several years, to little effect. But virtually everyone concedes that things are different this time around. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, the rise of Europe s General Data Protection Regulation, and especially the June <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationaljournal.com/s/669859/new-california-law-paves-way-for-congressional-action-on-data-privacy?mref=search-result\"> passage </url> of the California Consumer Privacy Act have all combined to create a sudden clamor for congressional action. </p><p> The question is no longer whether we need a federal law to protect consumers  privacy,  Sen. John Thune, the committee s chairman, said as the hearing opened.  The question is what shape would that law take. </p><p>Industry agrees, with most major corporations now supporting broad privacy provisions such as transparency requirements, consumer control over personal information, and basic limitations on the collection and use of personal information. The sticking point, however, appears to be how companies should be punished when they run afoul of new federal rules.</p><p>Several Democrats drew a clear line in the sand over the need to expand the Federal Trade Commission s ability to crack down on privacy violations. Sen. Bill Nelson, the committee s ranking member, asked the assembled tech executives whether they would support a bill providing the FTC with increased legal authority and better tools to protect consumer privacy. </p><p> We don t support unfettered discretion in any agency,  responded Len Cali, the senior vice president for global public policy at AT&amp;T. Keith Enright, the chief privacy officer at Google, suggested that lawmakers should  first look at whether [the FTC s] existing authority is enabling them to exercise their mission effectively.  Nelson told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>after the hearing that he was dissatisfied with those answers.</p><p>The FTC currently has some limited powers to enforce consumer privacy agreements, but it is constrained in its ability to make privacy rules and unable to unilaterally levy fines against companies found to have violated consumer privacy protections. Schatz and other Democrats are seeking to change that, but they're worried the tech industry won t back the proposal.</p><p> They made positive sounds, but the litmus test is the FTC s authority to fine and to make rules,  Schatz told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">.</emphasis>  And if they start to waffle on that, then I will know they re not serious. </p><p>Other Democrats warned against preempting strict new privacy laws without first creating a federal framework with teeth. </p><p> Companies that are represented here today, and all across the country, are ultimately going to want the California law preempted,  said Sen. Ed Markey.  And they re going to want other states  laws preempted. They re going to ask this panel to do that. </p><p> So our role has to be to ensure that any law which we pass out of this committee is a strong law,  Markey continued.  We don t need to pass weak laws in Washington that override strong laws in California, Massachusetts, and other states. </p><p>Tech executives on Wednesday frequently bemoaned the onerous costs of compliance with new privacy rules, including those out of Europe. Enright estimated that Google lost at least tens of millions of dollars and  hundreds of years  of cumulative man-hours while gearing up for the implementation of the GDPR, and he urged Congress not to emulate those efforts.</p><p>But Sen. Richard Blumenthal sought to call the industry s bluff, asking if any of the companies were leaving Europe or planning to cease operations in California. None answered in the affirmative. </p><p> All their warnings and fears seem pretty much hyped,  Blumenthal told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">National Journal </emphasis>after the hearing.  They re not pulling out of anywhere. </p><p>Democratic skepticism of industry intentions further complicates what is sure to be a complex process, given the size of the industry and the number of stakeholders involved. Thune, whose office is now taking the lead in drafting the legislation, stressed the importance of a unified approach on an issue as convoluted as data privacy especially as the November election approaches and leadership shake-ups loom on the horizon.</p><p> Whoever s in charge after this election this issue s not going away,  Thune told reporters after Wednesday s hearing.  But I think it s going to have to be a bipartisan solution. </p><p>While Thune admitted he and his fellow Republicans would prefer a  light-touch approach  over the  heavy regulatory approach  favored by Democrats, he also suggested that tech companies are in no position to dictate terms to Congress.</p><p> They want preemption,  said Thune.  And they want a national approach to this, not a 50-state approach. So I think that provides us with some leverage, and I think it also suggests that they re going to have to be at the table and offering up good solutions for this. </p><p>Time is not on industry s side.  The pressure is the [January] 2020 implementation of [the California Consumer Privacy Act], so that s obviously looming,  said Will Rinehart, director of technology and innovation policy at the right-leaning American Action Forum.</p><p>And some Democrats warn that as the process drags on, a federal privacy bill may only get tougher on industry. </p><p> I think the longer the debate goes, the more [a federal bill] looks like the GDPR or California,  Blumenthal said.  Because the more people become aware of the privacy threat, the less tolerant they re going to be of the industry double-talk. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNGDLY-672947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNGDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-8NB1-JBNW-3163-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8371</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1113\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The National Journal Group, Inc.

And thanks to Sean for letting me sit in this chair. Thank you for joining me, and I will see you next time. I'm Tammy Bruce here for Sean Hannity. Have a great weekend, everyone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is a special edition of \"The Ingraham Angle\" from Washington tonight. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, he's come under huge fire for suing localities in his own state over mandating their own COVID-19 rules. He's here to respond to them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, tonight, Raymond Arroyo digs into Biden's latest mask ad. It's hilarious. Goya's ultimate revenge and Fauci on the catwalk. \"Friday Follies\" is a must-see, as always.</p><p>But first, there's no getting around it, according to most polls, President Trump is running behind Joe Biden. The current RCP average has him trailing the Former VP by nearly 9 points. But on the economy, the new \"NBC/Wall Street Journal\" poll gave Trump record high marks on the issue.</p><p>Well, the story of the moment, however, is COVID. It's dominating everywhere, and it's where voters favor Biden. Now, that shouldn't be the case. And I'm going to tell you why it is. The issues at hand are right in Trump's wheelhouse.</p><p>Number one, the virus came from China. Trump has been a greater hawk on China than any president in my lifetime, and his ban on travel, without a doubt, saved thousands of lives.</p><p>Number two. When PPE, ventilators, mobile hospitals, et cetera were needed, Trump answered the call. He mobilized all the right people. His administration marshaled both the government and private companies, and they delivered in rapid speed and historic fashion.</p><p>And number three, to get out of this mess, we're going to need an unprecedented economic revival, an issue, as we noted above, Trump dominates. All right. Continue to hold firm on all three and remind Americans, Mr. President, that you're going to put them first.</p><p>Joining me now is Sara Carter, Fox News Contributor, host of \"The Sara Carter Show\" podcast. Also, with me, Lara Logan, host of \"Lara Logan Has No Agenda\" on Fox Nation, and Tom Bevan, Co-Founder and President of RealClearPolitics.</p><p>Tom, let's start with you. Does President Trump have the potential to turn voters' opinions around on just that issue of handling COVID?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Well, that's a good question. I mean, when this initially started, his approval rating on COVID was very positive. He has over 50 percent approval in positive territory, but he's had a pretty steady and slow decline over the past few weeks to the point now where he's at his lowest point. I think it's about - under 40 percent in our RealClearPolitics average.</p><p>So I'm not sure how many - I mean - and really what he's lost are a little bit of Republicans, but mostly independents. Democrats were never with him in the first place. They've never approved of his handling of anything, let alone COVID. So he's really got to win back independents. And there's still time to do that. It's still possible. I don't think they've totally tuned him out yet on the issue of his handling of COVID.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, Sara, I was talking today to a couple of restauranteurs. I happened to know a lot of restauranteurs in the area. They're really having a hard time because they're getting mixed signals, open, close, 75 percent, 50 percent.</p><p>Virginia is doing pretty well on the COVID front right now, but they get a sense that any moment the rug is going to be pulled out from under them. When does that begin to turn a bit in the President's favor if he says we've got to move on with life and try to take sensible measures at the same time?</p><p>SARA CARTER, \"THE SARA CARTER SHOW\" PODCAST AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think you brought up such a great point, and I think that's the administration - that's up to the administration to make that message clear and to make sure that that narrative sticks that there isn't any back and forth.</p><p>I mean, think about what President Trump has already done, Laura. I mean, he has cut back over 25,000 pages - he even talked about that this week - of regulations that brought small businesses back booming in America.</p><p>When COVID finally comes down, when we've got to recover and we are in the recovery process at the very beginnings of this, we need a president that is going to reinvigorate the economy, bring back business. And that will include deregulations, that will include pushing the economy forward, especially in minority communities. We're not going to see that from Vice President Biden at all.</p><p>In fact, he's announced a $2 trillion climate policy plan that's going to initiate a bundle of regulations and really squeeze the small business owner and the workforce, and that's the restauranteurs that you're talking about. These are the people, the American workforce. And President Trump has this. He can move this forward.</p><p>I really believe that this is a glass-half-full situation, Laura, and I think that if the President sticks to the narrative, continues to deliver the message to the American people that he delivered in 2016, he will clench this. There is a lot of time--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: --between now and November.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. If you want to be locked in, vote for Biden, because it looks like they're beginning--</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --new lockdowns, especially in blue states.</p><p>All right. Lara, despite Biden's - you have to call it a decline, a clear decline, and no real campaign, the media are fawning all over him. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This afternoon, a blistering indictment of Trump from Joe Biden--</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, MSNBC HOST: The basement approach, which Trump makes fun of, actually focuses his message, focuses his empathy, focuses the fact that he knows what he is talking about--</p><p>JOHN HEILEMANN, MSNBC NATIONAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: The President is incredibly frustrated in that he cannot find an effective frame for Joe Biden. This is like the nightmare candidate for him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Lara, how big of a problem is it that we don't have any semblance of an objective press less than four months out of a Presidential election?</p><p>LARA LOGAN, INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST AND FOX NATION HOST: Well, these are all the same people who predicted that Trump would lose the election in 2016. And since then, it's only gotten worse because many people that I speak to say why wouldn't they just come out and admit that they really are not objective in any way and that they just hate this President, and they'll do anything to stop him being reelected because that's very obvious to most people.</p><p>And you always wonder with these polls, first of all, why anyone is listening to the polls because they were all wrong last time as well. And also, many people that I speak to pay absolutely no attention to them, because the one question they say that polls are not asking is how many people are - how many lives is it costing to save each person from this virus.</p><p>And that's the question that really resonates with people all over this country. Maybe it's because I live in (inaudible) country, but it's all the people are talking about here from morning to night. They don't trust the numbers. They don't trust the CDC. They take the virus very seriously indeed. It should not be mistaken for people being skeptics or doubters or doubting the severity of the illness that results from this virus. It's not that at all.</p><p>But what they see is that people are being geographically isolated, the response to the virus has become increasingly political, the impact that it's having on the election makes people nervous with mail-in ballots and the restrictions on gathering indoors and the social distancing, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>And people are increasingly concerned about the suicide rate, depressions, the cost to many children when you're told to stay safe, stay in the safety of your home and your home isn't safe at all. And so people are really - they're sort of rebelling against what they see as a form of control, political control, which goes - yes - which goes hand-in-hand with skepticism about it and a lack of trust in the numbers.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's a healthy skepticism, I think. And just so people understand, the polls, just we'll put them up for a moment. 2016, Clinton held a double-digit lead of 12 points over president - Donald Trump at that time.</p><p>I want to just go one step further with you, Tom, and go back to what we talked about really quickly. The lockdowns, how popular will they be when they start rolling back into effect and you sense it's coming in a number of states? There's is a crescendo building even in the media and among some politicos. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think a strong argument can be made for a significant mitigation efforts, even shutting down for a few weeks.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This continuing rising outbreak that is going to necessitate more lockdown--</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --where they need a statewide shutdown, a shelter-in- place--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: So, again, this is what they're egging on, Tom. Will this be popular October 1st when things begin to lock down right before an election?</p><p>BEVAN: Hard to say. Again, people are very concerned about the virus and they want to stay safe. But at the same time, there are economic trade- offs, as we've seen, with the explosion in the unemployment rate. I mean, what this really also plays into, Laura, is the whole issue of schools.</p><p>And there, that couldn't be a starker divide between Donald Trump and the Republicans wanting to reopen schools and really some of the Democrats and blue state mayors and governors who are basically saying, agreeing with the teachers union, saying we need to go online. There was a pull-out this week that says 74 percent of people say that that's the most important thing.</p><p>The top priority for the government should be reopening schools safely. It well outpaces anything else - business, churches, any of that stuff. And parents are really worried about this because it has an economic component. If they can't get the kids back in school, it puts a current vulnerability to work. So - and that's a pretty potent political issue. It's top of mind for voters. And that in combination with an economic lockdown, again, it will be pretty stark divide between President Trump and Joe Biden--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. I think it's going to be--</p><p>BEVAN: --leading up to the election.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I think it's going to be liberty versus lockdown. I think that's going to be the theme. Really quickly, Sara, Nancy Pelosi today was yearning for something. I want to show you what it is. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We're in a very critical place. I yearn for other Republican presidents. While we may have disagreed on many points, at least we had a shared commitment to the governance of our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: She yearns for other Republicans, Sara. She yearns for them.</p><p>CARTER: Right. Right. She yearned for the old establishment, Laura. That's what this is all about. The fight is not even so much with President Trump. It's a fight with the American people. They don't want the American people disrupting what they had. That stability, that establishment, that ability to do whatever they want without question. And now we're holding them accountable.</p><p>And that's what this Presidency was all about. It was about holding Washington accountable and cleaning out the swamp. And the American people still want that. They need that. But what they need is the administration to stand up, to deliver that message to stay strong on that message, and to let people know that, look, we haven't given up this fight, we're out here every single day and we're not going to let it happen.</p><p>And Tom brought up a great point, and so did you. We want to see our children back in school, and we want some normalcy back in our lives. And that's what's going to take this election all the way in November.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Real - and again, real quick, Lara. On the idea of yearning for the past, in 2008 - I'm sure you remember this - when George W. Bush gave a speech in Israel and was referencing basically - I'm summarizing - about aiding and abetting terrorists with the lingo of Barack Obama or - something like that. She said, well, \"the comments were beneath the dignity of the office.\" I mean, they were strafing George W. Bush in 2008, and now suddenly we're yearning for other Republican presidents. I don't know who she's talking about then.</p><p>LOGAN: Well, it's interesting, Laura, because Nancy Pelosi now has some strong allies on the right. And there's a vocal minority who are just as vicious about President Trump as the Democrats. And a lot of people that I've spoken say that's because when the President does something like, for example, Space Force, taking a program that was classified for years and putting it into the light, that's trillions of dollars in dark money that is now in the light.</p><p>And what you've done then is effectively draining the swamp financially in a massive way. And most people don't pay any attention to this. But it means that people on the left and the right, the establishment that Sara was talking about, those people have lost a lot of their advantage that they had.</p><p>And that's where the ordinary person here says that Donald Trump is a President of change. They never wanted him to be seen as a President of change. If you go back to the propaganda from the very moment that he won the election, it said, \"This presidency is not about change.\" Well, because that tells you that that's exactly what it's about.</p><p>And one of the disturbing things here that people have raised with me is all the talk about Trump is not going to leave office and Trump won't hand over the nuclear codes. What are they setting the conditions for, exactly? If there is any dispute over mail-in ballots or voter fraud or any of those states or giving all their votes to the popular vote winners nationwide and not given their Electoral College votes--</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right.</p><p>LOGAN: --as they traditionally have been given.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Got to go.</p><p>LOGAN: If there's any dispute over that, are they going to say, yes, you see there, we told you he wasn't going to leave office?</p><p>INGRAHAM: They're going to short-circuit it. They don't want anyone to question them, Lara. You're exactly right. It's going to be any irregularities, no, you're questioning the results of an election, you got to get out, and we hope the military will help--</p><p>LOGAN: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --throw him out of the White House. That's exactly what they're setting up. Fascinating conversation, panel. Thank you so much.</p><p>LOGAN: Exactly.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Great to see you all tonight.</p><p>Up next, we talked to the Governor trying to protect his citizens' lives and liberty by pushing back on oppressive lockdowns. That man, Governor Brian Kemp, joins us in moments.</p><p>INGRAHAM: While some governors are using the COVID crisis to grab more power and undermine their citizens' Constitutional rights, my next guest is among those actually trying to preserve liberty while also saving lives and he's taking on officials in his own state to do it. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is suing the City of Atlanta for mandating masks but mainly for going back into lockdown. This morning, Atlanta's Mayor responded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR KEISHA LANCE BOTTOMS, (D) ATLANTA: It is mind-boggling that this Governor wastes resources on suing me personally and our city council for mask mandate and advisory voluntary business recommendations and guidelines. It is very clear that he is putting politics over people. It is really a distraction from what the real enemy is here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Governor Kemp joins me now, exclusively.</p><p>Governor, it's great to see you. What's your response to the Mayor there?</p><p>GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): Laura, let me tell you what's really going on in Georgia. I'm working very hard every day and have been for a long time now to protect the lives as well as the livelihoods of my fellow citizens. However, we have people, local mayors that are playing politics. They want to go back to shelter-in-place, they want to stop in-person dining with no notice, just pulling the rug out from under people. And I'm just not going to allow that to happen.</p><p>We're fighting two battles here now, one to protect lives but also to protect livelihoods. And so I've filed a lawsuit to stop them because those orders are in conflict with the statewide order that I have executed for the public health state of emergency.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, Governor Kemp, there are those who would say, look, if the masks help in 10 percent of the cases, then why isn't that good enough to just say, look, you can save some lives, maybe they're not 100 percent, isn't that worth this ongoing mask mandate some of these mayors have in place. What would your response to that be?</p><p>KEMP: I think a little differently on that. Dr. Toomey, I'm still following the health advice that she's giving me. She's a 40-year epidemiologist, Harvard-educated, great person, lot of experience as much as anybody in the country. I don't feel like a mandate is needed for Georgians to do the right thing.</p><p>We have existing orders on the books, Laura. And this is what's so frustrating about the lot of the locals that are playing politics with this, as we have orders on the books that has worked in the past, that helped us flatten the curve, that helped us stop the spread.</p><p>They have the ability through my order to use their law enforcement to enforce those orders, and they're not doing that. And that's what I've been telling them. Instead of having a government mandate, enforce the orders that we have, make sure businesses are following the rules, people are socially distancing.</p><p>I've been talking about people wearing a mask as much as anybody. And I said today in my press conference, for those that do not want to wear a mask, if you have a health condition that prevents it or some sort of phobia or anything else, just socially distance yourself. If everybody does their part, we'll flatten the curve again, we'll stop the spread, and we can continue to reopen our economy. But it's so important that we do that.</p><p>I mean, we literally have people that are living paycheck-to-paycheck. They're barely getting by in this economic environment. Our business owners - the amount of mortgages aren't being paid on time is going up. And we're looking at large companies like Delta Air Lines and others that in the future if the economy doesn't rebound, they're going to be forced to start laying people off. So we've got to keep our economy open but also fight the virus and protect lives. And that's what we're doing.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Governor Kemp, this is kind of a controversial question. But do you think that there is something else going on here where there's some element within the Democrat Party who think a shutdown - yes, it probably would save lives, people would be at home - but that that would actually pull the brakes on a recovery, which is obviously underway before a Presidential election.</p><p>I'm asking that because that's what so many of my viewers are wondering, saying, wait a second, we know there are some hotspots that you're dealing with those, but you shut this economy down in a lot of states again and we're toast.</p><p>KEMP: Yes, people can't handle it. I wouldn't be able to speak to their politics. It certainly seems like they're trying to undermine our economic recovery. I'm as concerned about the virus as anybody. We're working with our local school leaders and our school superintendent to get schools open.</p><p>I got just accosted when I started opening businesses early on by the left because they were making fun of us opening barbershops and hair salons, and now they're saying that the guidance that we had, having people wear a mask and use PPE and having these rules in places, have kept the spread down in our salons and barbershops.</p><p>So I don't - I don't know - I mean, it's got to be pandemic politics. But I know this. Talking to our hospital CEOs, they cannot go through what we did before. They will not be financially viable. It will bankrupt our hospitals.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>KEMP: We've heard from restauranteurs out there that are like, if we have to shut down again, if we have to move away--</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, it's over.</p><p>KEMP: --from in-person dining, we're out for good.</p><p>INGRAHAM: No, it's over. Finally--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KEMP: --our state can't afford that.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Finally, sir, really quick. University of Georgia, are they going to be playing football in the fall?</p><p>KEMP: Well, I've told all the young people, including my daughters, who are doing a really good job of following guidance most of the time, that our young folks need to wear a mask if they're going out and they can't socially distance, and they've got to follow the guidance and the advice if they want college football this fall. That is like a religion here in the south.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Exactly.</p><p>KEMP: I want to see it happen. It's a huge economic impact, but we need it mentally as a society right now. So that's why I'm asking everybody, for the next four weeks, wear a mask, socially distance, wash your hands, and follow the existing guidance that we have. It will work--</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right.</p><p>KEMP: --and flatten the curve.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Governor, great to see you tonight. Thanks for fighting for small businesses and parents and people who want to go to school, and it's inspiring to see. I'm glad you're out there doing it. And best of luck to you, sir.</p><p>KEMP: God bless you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. In speaking of masks, they were the animating feature of Dr. Fauci's interview with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. But did Fauci hit the mark?</p><p>Here now is Dr. Ramin Oskoui, cardiologist, CEO of Foxhall Cardiology.</p><p>Dr. Oskoui, you just heard Governor Kemp. He said that, look, if young people wear masks and socially distance, they'll have a better chance of having a football season, going back to college. And that's fine. I think people are going to try to do what they can do. But we've already exposed that the science behind regular cloth mask wearing, not surgical mask or the N95, is a little dubious.</p><p>So, in this interview, we were talking about with Mark Zuckerberg, Fauci strongly recommended mandating masks, including ones that are not medical grade. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, WHITE HOUSE CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE MEMBER: The recommendation was not to wear a mask because of the shortage of it. Two things happened. One, it became clear that we had enough of equipment. So there was no shortage. It became clear that cloth coverings that you didn't have to buy in a store, that you can make yourself, were adequate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: OK. That's the rub there. Is it not, Dr. Oskoui?</p><p>DR. RAMIN OSKOUI, CEO, FOXHALL CARDIOLOGY: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Are cloth coverings making people safer and adequate?</p><p>OSKOUI: I think the short answer is no. There actually are studies that have shown that cloth masks are next to worthless. And there is some question whether by holding on to those particles, you may actually be making yourself sick.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Or certainly more susceptible to--</p><p>OSKOUI: Absolutely.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --to getting some of these viruses. Was that the Vietnamese study, I believe? Was that--</p><p>OSKOUI: Correct.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Am I getting that right? OK.</p><p>OSKOUI: It is. It is, yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Zuckerberg also asked Fauci this question.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: --breathing in more carbon dioxide. Are there any issues like that? And from all of the studies around this, has anything negative been found?</p><p>FAUCI: Not at all, Mark. There has not been any indication that putting a mask on and wearing a mask for a considerable period of time has any deleterious effects on oxygen exchange--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, that's maybe on oxygen. That is correct. Correct?</p><p>OSKOUI: That's correct for most patients. But there are some patients who are a bit fragile. Those with emphysema who are wearing a mask can - can possibly be problematic. Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And it looks like--</p><p>OSKOUI: That's not entirely true.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And it looks like the concerns we had on the show about the accuracy of COVID death counts, Dr. Oskoui, and you've been part of this conversation for months now--</p><p>OSKOUI: Sure.</p><p>INGRAHAM: --that were well placed. An investigation by Fox Orlando is now revealing that a victim of a motorcycle accident was actually labeled as a COVID death.</p><p>OSKOUI: Yes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're discussing and trying to argue with the state. Not because of the numbers. I mean, it's 100. It doesn't make any difference if it's 99.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But the validity that the fact that the individual didn't die from COVID-19, died in the crash.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: First of all, I can't hear what anyone is saying in a mask, number one. Number two, Dr. Oskoui, how pervasive do you think reporting errors like this are? It's just - is this just a one-off?</p><p>OSKOUI: I don't think it's a one-off. I think what HHS has to do is audit every COVID death and every COVID diagnosis of every hospital. Remember, we're paying bonus money to patients who are intubated for COVID and who are diagnosed as having COVID in the hospital. That's coming to hundreds of millions of dollars. I think - so the American people don't get cheated, these hospitals need to be audited, every single one of them, every single case.</p><p>INGRAHAM: The hydroxychloroquine study, Dr. Oskoui, that was touted by CNN as showing, see, we told you so, no benefit to hydroxychloroquine. 15 seconds. Why was that junk?</p><p>OSKOUI: Well, it's a small study, interestingly, underpowered by Bowers (ph) own admission. And as you see, with an intention to treat protocol, they had a 60 percent reduction in mortality. It's - there are much better studies, much bigger studies that clearly show efficacy in the same population.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. And actually talk to treating physicians, let them make their own decisions since the drug is very safe.</p><p>OSKOUI: Yes.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dr. Oskoui, as always, invaluable analysis. Thanks so much.</p><p>OSKOUI: My pleasure. Thank you.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And up ahead, we unmask Joe Biden's new ad and the media's embarrassing meltdown over Trump's and Goya Foods. It's \"Friday Follies\" next.</p><p>MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's news headquarters, I'm Marianne Rafferty.</p><p>The Pentagon rolled out a new policy that essentially bans Confederate flags on all military property, Defense Secretary Mark Esper's memo lists the types of flags that can be displayed. The rebel flag is absent from that list. Senior military leaders were aiming to avoid a dispute with President Trump. The president has defended the people's rights to display the controversial banner.</p><p>And Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is once again battling cancer. The 87-year-old revealing today that she is undergoing chemotherapy to treat liver cancer. Ginsburg says the treatment is yielding positive results and has no plans to retire. She was hospitalized earlier this week with an infection but says that was unrelated to the cancer. Ginsburg has previously recovered from pancreatic, lung, and colon cancer.</p><p>I Marianne Rafferty. Now back to \"The Ingraham Angle.\"</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and that means it's time for \"Friday Follies.\" Joining us with all the details, Raymond Arroyo, FOX News contributor. Raymond, Biden released an ad this week in Texas that was rather peculiar.</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: It's clear that his running mate so far, Laura, seems be COVID-19. But he's all in on wearing masks, mostly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This virus is tough, but we can stop the spread. Wear a mask.</p><p>We're all in this together. We'll fight this together.</p><p>I'm Joe Biden, and I approve this message.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ARROYO: I guess wear a mask except when you meet strangers at a rally, in which case you don't have to wear a mask at all, I guess.</p><p>Laura, I'm stunned that a PSA is now a campaign slogan. What's next? don't smoke? Wear your seatbelt? He seems to be running for surgeon general rather than president.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm just glad -- they need a bubble wrap between him and all those young women that he -- there needs to be a Plexiglas divider between Biden and any female person at a rally. You just know that arm is coming across. What else, Ray?</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, you had the Goya CEO on after Julian Castro and AOC and others attempted to boycott his company. This came in response to the CEO of Goya's appearance at a Trump event. This week, Ivanka Trump and the president posted their support for the company on social media, and the talking heads exploded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: On your dime, in the middle of a pandemic, they are selling beans. You tell me how a president in the middle of the pandemic has got time for this --? Are you kidding me? Hawking products?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: In the middle of the pandemic, Laura Ingraham. Chris Cuomo forgets to remind his viewers what he and his brother, the love gov, were doing during a pandemic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: In scale, this was the actual swab that was being used to fit up that double barrel shotgun that you had mounted on the front of your pretty face.</p><p>Do you think that you are an attractive person now because you're single and ready to mingle?</p><p>GOV. ANDREW CUOMO, (D) NEW YORK: I think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Don't you miss those? I miss those.</p><p>ARROYO: So that's perfectly acceptable during a pandemic.</p><p>INGRAHAM: I miss those, don't you?</p><p>ARROYO: I do, too. The Cuomo bro show was classic. And look, for the record, Laura, Michelle Obama in conjunction with her Let's Move initially, you remember this, she openly courted support and promoted a number of well-known American brands, Goya included, by the way.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, she was doing it to help everybody lose weight and get healthy. Did we ever do the review on how well the Let's Move program did? Did we reduce obesity in the United States? I must have missed that.</p><p>ARROYO: I don't think we did.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Overall reduction, we have more food deserts and we have more obesity post move on. But great idea.</p><p>And then Joy Behar, she was on \"The View,\" and she extolled the virtues of boycotts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOY BEHAR, CO-HOST, \"THE VIEW\": We would still have apartheid, for example, in South Africa now if other countries including the United States did not boycott South Africa. Boycotts are extremely, extremely effective.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: Laura, Goya is not enslaving people abroad unlike many of these -- unlike China and many of these companies that do business with them. The other thing the Biden folks and AOC and company have to be very careful of. We Hispanics are now 20 percent, almost 20 percent of this population, 60 million. They have to be careful when they boycott a brand like this that's Hispanic owned and operated. It has the risk of upsetting a whole lot of your voters out there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Look, if we had Behar out their lobbying to divest from China, then I'd actually take her a little bit more seriously. But she's going back to 1984 and the divestment from South Africa for the analogy. If you really want to take this to where it needs to go, don't focus on the U.S. police departments. Focus on what's happening in China where they are loading people on trains and taking them to lord knows where. But come on, this is ridiculous. Good for the Goya CEO.</p><p>ARROYO: This was a very strange week. While the president was being wrapped for posing with beans, Dr. Fauci was being hailed for posing next to his pool for an \"InStyle\" magazine cover. Look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Fauci told \"InStyle\" magazine \"I don't like conflict.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fauci conceded his straight talk has rankled White House officials, telling \"InStyle\" magazine, \"Well, you know, that really changes week to week and month to month.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's done a new interview, and people are kind oif going, you know, it's kind of great.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ARROYO: Kind of great. Norah O'Donnell conducted this probing interview for \"InStyle,\" Laura, where we learned his exercise habits and what Dr. Fauci eats in the morning. Melania Trump is still waiting for her \"InStyle\" cover, I'll just point that out.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We talked about this with Dr. Oskoui, but he did this live interview with Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>ARROYO: I saw it.</p><p>INGRAHAM: A lot of people on the livestream are like is Mark Zuckerberg trying out for a position on \"60 Minutes,\" because he was like, well, tell us about this? People don't want to stay in their lanes. They want to go in every lane.</p><p>If they ever do the movie, forget Brad Pitt. I was thinking they should try to find out wherever Lee Strasberg is. Remember, he was in \"Godfather II.\" He would be the perfect Anthony Fauci, just saying. Sadly, he's no longer with us.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That is genius, but that exhumation of the body would probably upset the family, Raymond. All right, Raymond, have a great weekend. We'll wait for your \"InStyle\" profile soon.</p><p>ARROYO: I will, too.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And worst in media, who are the biggest offenders of the week? We'll tell you. Plus Bill Barr's grave warning to American businesses on China, and the disturbing response he got. It was amazing speech, and you didn't see any of it. We'll bring it to you. Don't go away.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's easy to become numb to media bias these days, I get it, but \"The Ingraham Angle\" is keeping track of the worst offenders of the week for you.</p><p>Joining me now is Adam Guillette, president of \"Accuracy in Media.\" Adam, good to see you tonight. Let's begin with Katy Tur's mindless rant defending BLM protests.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATY TUR, MSNBC HOST: Mandate masks. I don't understand the pushback on it. It just doesn't make any sense when you think about it logically.</p><p>The protests were outdoors. All of the doctors and health experts say that that is a safer place to hold them. I attended a number of those rallies. Everybody was wearing a mask.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Later in the show Chuck Todd hit back against a guest who called out their own media bias.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Just a reminder, for what it's worth, there is no editorial point of view here on any of these newscasts on MSNBC in the daytime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>INGRAHAM: I'm going to -- that, I didn't even know he said that. That's -- Adam, he's got to be kidding me.</p><p>ADAM GUILLETTE, PRESIDENT, ACCURACY IN MEDIA: MSNBC denies being an opinion channel, pretends to be a news channel, but in reality, they're a comedy channel. You don't even need the volume. Just look at the chyrons. The headlines on the screen read like something that you would see on Facebook from your liberal nephew who is at Berkeley. Their stuff is out of control. And their coverage of Black Lives Matter is hysterically ridiculous. It's great just watching for the laughs.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Just the lower third, the scroll, Donald Trump wants kids to die from COVID. It is the most inflammatory stuff.</p><p>And up next, MSNBC's Jason Johnson, he is just one of the many commentators peddling this sick conspiracy theory.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Because so many of these ballots are going to be coming in by mail, we're not going to have a new president on election night. It's going to take weeks.</p><p>You're going to have militia showing up at vote counting locations threatening people.</p><p>We have a president who is a proto-dictator, and he will do anything in his power to stay, regardless of what the actual numbers say.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Adam, I fully expect they are going to perhaps not expect a win by Donald Trump on election night, because they will say we'll find ballots in the back of someone's car somewhere. But as far as the militia showing up, why has this become such a prevailing claim on the left?</p><p>GUILLETTE: Think about the history. They haven't accepted a defeat a presidential election in AOC's lifetime. They didn't accept the W. defeat. They didn't accept the Trump defeat. They're still skeptical about 1988 when they blame the Willie Horton ad for things. It's out of control.</p><p>And their talk about violence and militias, that is projection if I've ever seen it. These are people who don't believe in individualism, don't believe in liberty. They only believe in brute force to advance their means. That's why they're symbol is the fist. You see them on the ground in CHAD in Seattle. They are armed carrying weapons, yet they admonish anybody else who carries weapons and exercises Second Amendment rights.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, let's move on to this pathetic attempt to blame law-abiding gun owners for the recent crime wave. Here's the headline from \"The Washington Post,\" \"Spike in violent crime follows rise in gun buying amid social upheaval.\" And the very first line of the article actually says \"Americans purchased millions more guns than usual this spring, spurred in large part by racial animosity.\" Adam, I guess they've interviewed all these gun owners? How does \"The Washington Post\" actually get away with framing things like this?</p><p>GUILLETTE: It's ridiculous that they try to pretend that gun rights is a racial institution when in fact gun control is the most racist institution. One of our investigative journalists was on the ground in CHAD a few weeks ago, and he got a Marxist saying something I totally agree with. The Marxist reminded everyone that gun control laws were racist laws. They were created to take gun rights away from freed slaves. If you want to be upset about racist institutions, take down gun control laws and celebrate gun rights.</p><p>INGRAHAM: CHAZ, CHOP, whatever we're going to call it, Adam, great to see it tonight. Have a great weekend.</p><p>And in moments, A.G. Bill Barr's devastating takedown of Hollywood and big tech's cozy relationship with China. I've been waiting for someone to say this. It's one of the most consequential speeches on the subject in just a moment. Stay there.</p><p>INGRAHAM: This did not get nearly the attention it deserved, especially considering the importance of the topic. Yesterday Attorney General Bill Barr delivered a stark warning on the dangers of further economic and cultural entanglement with communist China. First, to the big business interests and globalists pushing for more trade with China, Barr had this to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: The ultimate ambition of China's rulers isn't to trade with the United States. It is to raid the United States. If you are an American business leader, appeasing the PRC may bring short-term rewards, but in the end, the PRC's goal is to replace you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: It was a tour de force. China isn't just looking to control our industries but our cultural institutions as well, from universities to the film industry. Barr called out these bad actors as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: Hollywood now regularly sensors its own movies to appease the Chinese Communist Party, the world's most powerful violator of human rights. Chinese government censors don't need to say a word because Hollywood is doing their work for them. This is a massive propaganda coup for the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: No wonder no one covered this, it was great. And finally, Barr took aim at the American industry perhaps most submissive to the whims of Beijing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: Hollywood is far from alone in kowtowing to the PRC. America's big tech companies have also allowed themselves to become pawns of Chinese influence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: And wittingly or unwittingly, they are aiding and abetting China's mass surveillance and censorship of its own citizens, not to mention the brutal oppression of the Uighur Muslims. Instead of viewing it as a need wake-up call, some shortsighted critics lashed out, even going so far as to call Barr's speech worse than McCarthyism. Be sure to remember the names of those critics.</p><p>With just over 100 days until the election, the Trump administration is clear eyed about the threat of China as the president has been for many decades. Don't for a second think the Biden presidency will offer anything different than Hollywood and big tech's complete submission to Xi and his communist cronies.</p><p>\"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results again. We're going to tell you, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: \"The Ingraham Angle\" gets results. Just look at this week. After our coverage of the African-American History Museum's website on race, well, they took it down. That's a victory. We also exposed the racist diversity training given to government employees.

It's coming from the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, also a House subcommittee on Capitol Hill. The central question - have companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Google become too big and powerful? Congressman David Cicilline of Rhode Island is a Democrat leading the House investigation into the tech industry. Welcome to the program.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAVID CICILLINE:                 Thank you - great to be with you.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 What's the potential harm to consumers here? Is it a privacy issue, a pricing issue or just a question of market share? What's the problem you hope to address?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Well, the problem we are hoping to address is the enormous dominance of large technology platforms in the digital marketplace. And that results often in anti-competitive behavior that sometimes results in platforms favoring their own products or services or not respecting the privacy interests of consumers.             </p><p>                So there are a number of reasons to suggest that the market is not working properly as a result of this lack of competition. There hasn't been a full investigation - an antitrust investigation like this in more than 50 years, and so this is an opportunity to really look at, what is the impact on innovation; what is the impact on entrepreneurship, on competition and goods and services that consumers are purchasing?             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Often antitrust cases, anti-competitive arguments are based on prices being high. And in the case of the tech giants, Facebook is free. Amazon offers low prices. Does that make it harder for you to build a convincing argument?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 No. I would say first of all, these services are not free. You are providing very valuable data to these platforms, and that data is being used, sometimes misused without your authority. And there are also consequences to your ability to access goods. For example, Amazon takes information. They then have begun their own label, and they are putting small businesses out of business by producing products after collecting data on Amazon that favor their own goods and services. So it has an impact on the ability of rivals to maintain themselves in the marketplace, and innovation is significantly reduced when there's no competition, when there's this kind of market dominance.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Europe has really led the way on regulating these tech companies - not gone so far as to break them up but certainly put restrictions on them. Why do you think the U.S. has lagged so far behind?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 I think, you know, there has been a sort of general approach to sort of let these big platforms flourish - this idea that was - they were providing a lot of value; they were companies that were growing fast. And I think we just didn't fully realize all of the implications on the kind of dominance that they have in the marketplace.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 But to be fair, Europeans realized it years ago. So why wasn't the U.S. aware of this?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 It's a great question. I mean, there hasn't been good antitrust enforcement at the federal level. I think one of the things we have to look at is - and this investigation will provide us with that opportunity. We really need to look at all our existing antitrust statutes. It's an opportunity to kind of look top to bottom and determine how they need to be modernized. They were written back during the railroad monopolies, but I think there was just a reluctance in sort of the sense that this was exciting and adding lots of value and a lack of appreciation of what the real damages could be.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 I'm sure tech lobbyists and lawyers are already making a lot of money off of this. How worried do you think the executives of these companies should be? How likely is the threat of the companies being broken up?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Well, I think, you know, large technology companies should recognize that it's in their interests that this market work properly and that people have confidence that their data is protected, that there's good innovation and good competition available. So...             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Sure, but it might not be in the long-term interests of Facebook to be forced to sell WhatsApp or Instagram. Is that the sort of thing you're talking about?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Well, I think one of the things we absolutely will look at are the acquisitions that is extinguishing rivals, whether it's WhatsApp or other companies that buy competitors or prevent them from being successful as Facebook did with Vine. But we'd have to look at also the statutes to determine whether or not the DOJ and their antitrust enforcement could prevent some of these transactions from occurring.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Some of your own party's biggest donors are from Silicon Valley. Do you think Democrats have the will to defy these companies and the wealthy donors who run them?             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Absolutely. Look; this is a very important issue. This relates to this tremendous concentration of economic power that has in part made the economy not work for everyone. You know, when you have tremendous concentrations of economic power, it's often followed by tremendous concentrations of political power, and that's why we have to also be working to reduce the influence of money in our political system. But we've got to fix this problem. The Internet is broken. We're living in a monopoly moment. Our constituents expect us to fix this and to get this marketplace working right.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Congressman David Cicilline, thank you very much.             </p><p>DAVID CICILLINE:                 Thanks for having me.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 He's the Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201906062112</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8X-S381-DY1J-T3TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 6, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Diane Feinstein (D-CA) introduced a Bill on Wednesday that would Limit the Use of Voter Data by Political Campaigns.The Legislation is being touted as the first Bill \"directly responding to Cambridge Analytica,\" the 2018 Scandal that saw a Right-Wing Political Consulting firm use Data on Millions of American to Target Pro-Trump Messaging at Swing Voters.Feinstein's Voter Privacy Act[1] seeks to give Voters More Control over the Data Collected on them by Political Campaigns and Organizations.Under the Legislation, Voters would be Allowed to Access that Data, ask Political Campaigns to Delete it and Instruct Social Media Platforms like Google and Facebook to Stop Sharing Personal Data with those Political Entities.The Legislation would Intervene in the Large and Growing Business around Voter Data, which Campaigns increasingly Use to Direct their Messaging. \"Political candidates and campaigns shouldn't be able to use private data to manipulate and mislead voters,\" Feinstein said in a Statement. </p><p>\"This bill would help put an end to such actions.\"\"Today, campaigns are legally able to conduct sophisticated online surveillance of everyone in our country in order to influence individuals based on their unique psychological characteristics,\" she noted. \"This targeted manipulation not only undermines our democracy, it's a threat to basic individual freedom.'Cambridge Analytica, whose former VP was Steve Bannon, a Firm that has since Closed, Improperly Obtained the Personal Information of around 87 Million Facebook Users during the 2016 Presidential Race, Employing that Information to Target Pro-Trump and Anti-Clinton Messaging at Voters who they Determined were Undecided.The Cambridge Analytica Controversy set off enormous Debate in Washington and Globally over the Need to Regulate and Rein in Big Tech's Collection of User Data.Feinstein's Bill would Not apply to Information Obtained from Voter Registration Databases, which are Publicly Available. But it would Apply to a swath of Sensitive Data including Social Security Numbers, Personal Property Records, Biometric Information like DNA, Browsing History, Geolocation Data, Health Information, Education Data, and more.The Legislation quotes a Number of Studies that have Tracked the Boom of Voter Data in Political Campaigns.A 2014 Study by Researcher Ira Rubenstein, which is cited in the Bill Text, found Political Campaigns and Organizations are now able to \"assemble a vast array of [personally identifiable information] into detailed dossiers on practically every American voter in order to target voters with individualized messages.\"The Voter Privacy Act primarily would put the onus on Voters to Reach Out to the Political campaigns or Social Media Companies to Request an End to the Collection of their Information.

And that's SPECIAL REPORT for tonight. I'm Chris Wallace in Washington. \"THE STORY\" with Martha MacCallum is up next. Martha, do you guys start with a dance party?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST: Absolutely. Every night. Chris, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight. So, we have some breaking news for you this evening on THE STORY. There are brand new text messages obtained exclusively by Fox News that reveal a questionable relationship between the top Democrat in the Senate's Russia investigation, and a lobbyist representing a Russian oligarch.</p><p>Good evening, everybody, I'm Martha MacCallum and this is the story for tonight. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, who held numerous press conferences over the past year, promising a fair and bipartisan investigation into President Trump's supposed ties to Russia was apparently trying to gain access through the Russians to Christopher Steele, the author of the infamous anti-Trump dossier. Writing in part in these text messages that are just being revealed for the first time: \"We have so much to discuss. You need to be careful, but we can help our country.\" Fox News Chief National Correspondent, Ed Henry, live with the exclusive details on this brand new breaking story this evening. Ed, what can you tell us?</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Martha, good to see you. These text messages obtained by Fox show that Senator Mark Warner a Democrat, as you say, who's been leading one of several probes of President Trump's ties to Russia had extensive contact last year with the lobbyist for a Russian oligarch who offered him access, yes, to Christopher Steele. Now, Warner texted he would \"rather not have a paper trail in case he could not seal an agreement with the former British spy. Steele has still not agreed to an interview with the panel.</p><p>Warner began texting with the lobbyist, Adam Waldman, in February 2017 about brokering a deal with Justice Department to get the WikiLeaks Founder, Julian Assange, to the U.S. to potentially face criminal charges. That went nowhere. The Warner's office tells me, he turned over whatever information he got to the FBI in that matter. Warner and Waldman also exchanged dozens of texts about possible testimony from Waldman's primary client, the Russian billionaire, Oleg Deripaska, who had his visa revoked by the State Department in 06, because of charges he has organized crime ties -- which he denies. Warner was intent on connecting directly with Christopher Steele without anyone else being in the loop, at least initially.</p><p>An aide to the Republican Chairman, Senator Richard Burr, now tells Fox he was aware of the contact that Warner made, but added, \"I don't believe he was aware,\" Burr, \"of the content of these text messages that Fox is getting.\" Quote: \"We have so much to discuss. You need to be careful,\" Warner texted, \"but we can help our country.\" He sent that to Waldman last March 22nd. \"I'm in\", texted Waldman, whose firm has ties, yes, to Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Now, secrecy seemed important to Warner on March 29th. When the lobbyist revealed that Christopher Steele wanted a bipartisan letter from Warner and Burr: \"Hey,\" Warner texted, \"can't we do brief off-the-record call today before the letter, so I can frame letter?\" That's what Warner texted about Steele, who of course, put together, as you said, the dossier. Warner added, \"OK, but I would like to do preliminary call, you, me and him,\" meaning Steele, \"no one else before the letter just so we have to trail to start. Want to discuss scope first before letter, no leaks.\"</p><p>Waldman noted repeatedly, Steele was concerned about leaks so Warner texted back March 30th, \"We want to do this right, private in London. Don't want to send letter yet, because if we can't get agreement, would rather not have paper trail.\" Now, the committee got the text from Waldman, I'm told, last September. And Warner aide acknowledged that Warner and Burr revealed these texts to their colleagues quietly last October because, \"they realized out of context, it doesn't look great.\" But aides to Warner and Burr stressed to me today that Chairman, Mr. Burr, was in the loop.</p><p>The senators just gave us this joint statement: \"From the beginning of our investigation, we've taken each step in a bipartisan way, and we intend to continue to do so. Leaks of incomplete information out of context by anyone inside or outside our committee are unacceptable. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been in possession of this material for several months. The full committee has that access to the material and been briefed on its content, and committee investigators are pursued all relevant investigative leads related to this material.\" We wanted to give that full statement.</p><p>Now, Waldman, who did not return calls today seeking comment runs endeavor group. He signed $40,000 a month retainer in 2009 and 2010 to petition the U.S. government on behalf of that Russian billionaire, Deripaska. There are reports that Deripaska, who sued Paul Manafort over a failed business deal has information to share with the U.S. Congress, but last may both the Senate and House Intel panels decided not to give Deripaska legal immunity. So, so far, he has not testified, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I mean, it's clearly of interest that this Oleg Deripaska has links to both Paul Manafort and then also to this lobbyist who has done work for the Clintons. And, you know, it's potentially at least a stream to follow up on, that the Russians, perhaps, were trying to lay groundwork on both sides of the fence here.</p><p>HENRY: No doubt about it. And look, The Washington Post reported last year that the Special Counsel Robert Mueller is interested in the fact that there are other e-mails from Paul Manafort promising this Russia oligarch inside access to the Trump campaign. I can give you information before anyone else has it. Nobody knows whether that ever really happened. Clearly, Manafort was trying to wield influence. The committee, you know, still wants to talk to Manafort more, they want to the oligarch, they haven't gotten that testimony. But the bottom line is Democrats have spent a lot of time talking about the president's ties to Russians, what kind of conversations he and his aides have had.</p><p>Now, these text messages that got from a Republican source close to the committee. It's clearly an attempt by Republicans to say hang on a second. The top Democrat on this committee also had some questionable conversations about trying to keep some of this secret. And again, I want to stress, Warner's office was very direct with me in saying they realize that this doesn't look good out of context, as they say. But they insist that the Republican chairman was in the loop and that there was no freelancing going on here to try to get dirt from Christopher Steele.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, and I mean, obviously, they would like to hear from Christopher Steele, and it's clear from these messages that Christopher Steele, who was probably sensitive about what was being said about him and his reputation at this point didn't want to have any involvement that he might have appear partisan, right?</p><p>HENRY: Right, and that's why it's curious that Senator Warner, as a Democrat, who again has seen in public to act in a bipartisan manner with the Republican Richard Burr. They've had joint news conferences, all of that, at why he was texting: \"Look, let's just keep this between us.\" I will say that last October, Warner's office stressed this to me, there was a news conference where Richard Burr, after seeing these text messages, said that me and Warner are on the same page. You know, we're trying to get Steele to testify. They haven't been able to do that. But this is a wrinkle in all of that tonight, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, it certainly is. And both sides have sort of pointed fingers at each other from the House and Senate side that the House Intel Committee has all this friction between the Republicans and the Democrats. And that on the Senate side, the gentlemen are working everything out with no problems. This sort of put a little bit of wrinkle in that.</p><p>HENRY: This raises a question what's going on in private. And you think about this extraordinary thing where have you this big investigation in the Senate and a top Democrat who's investigating the president, now has his own text messages put into the committee record. I have over 20 pages of them. And I'm told, you know, they're marked confidential; not classified, we should say -- confidential. They are now in the committee record for this investigation. The text messages of Mark Warner who is doing the investigating. His messages are now part of the record as well.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, and Waldman is also of interest in terms of what he was working on.</p><p>HENRY: We tried to get him all day and we'll still hope to talk to him, and we hope to bring them to you tomorrow night.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. Interesting stuff, Ed, thank you so much. Thanks for being here tonight. So, here to react to this and a few other things, Congressman Jim Jordan, a member of the House Oversight Committee. Congressman, you heard Ed's report. What's your reaction?</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R), OHIO: If the Senate Intelligence Committee is so bipartisan, why did Senator Warner say he just wanted to meet no one else in that meeting except him, the lobbyist, and Christopher Steele? Why did he say he didn't want a paper trail and why was he willing to travel to London privately just to meet with Christopher Steele? If it's bipartisan, it should be bipartisan. So, I understand the statement that came from the chairman but that's the first reaction I have is, really? If this is how bipartisan works, then I'm a little confused.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Well, it should be pointed out, and I think it was at some point in the report, but this is all happening post-inauguration. This is the first four months or so of 2017. So, this is while the investigation is beginning. They very much, of course, would like to hear Christopher Steele's side of the story, and perhaps Senator Warner felt that he would have, you know, a better rapport with him. I don't know what he thought, but perhaps that was what he was doing.</p><p>JORDAN: The text messages themselves refute that because Christopher Steele is saying I want to do it in a bipartisan way. And never forget this is also in the context when they're using Christopher Steele's work product, namely the dossier to get the renewal at the FISA court. So, I mean, you can say it's bipartisan. They can say it's bipartisan. Maybe it still is. I just -- that's the first thing that came to mind as I just saw these text messages and heard Ed's report.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. All right, I do want to ask you about the other pressing news on the Hill tonight and that's whether or not there's going to be a shutdown. What do you think?</p><p>JORDAN: Look, we'll see. Senator Paul is over there giving, I think, a good speech. He did earlier tonight on some important issues. What I know is we shouldn't spend this kind of money. I mean, this is close to a trillion dollars -- excuse me, a quarter of a trillion dollars in new discretionary spending, 230-some billion. And I would bet there is not one Republican candidate, one Republican member of Congress who ran and said I'm going to increase discretionary spending $230 billion if you give us control of the House, the Senate and the White House, and yet that's what's happening. So, this is a bad deal. I hope it fails in the Senate. But if it comes back to us, I hope we vote it down and send back to them the same bill we sent to him two days ago, which takes care of our military but doesn't grow government.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, did Nancy Pelosi kind of put you guys in a bit of a box yesterday by speaking so long about DACA and perhaps pulling some other Democrats along with her. She is making your numbers a little difficult if the House Freedom Caucus is not on board with this deal?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, we'll see. I actually hope the Democrats vote no, and if the Democrats all vote no, we got enough votes to stop it, and then we can do what we told the people what we're going to do, namely: take care of our national defense and security needs but not grow the rest of government, not continue to grow these social welfare programs, and actually do something that's consistent with Republican principles and consistent with the mandate of the 2016 election. So, I hope all the Democrats vote no. If that's the case, we will definitely stop this bill, because the Freedom Caucus is against it, and so are a bunch of other conservatives in the House Republican Conference.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Apparently, Steny Hoyer has called Kevin McCarthy and asked for a 24-hour C.R. What do you think of that.</p><p>JORDAN: I think that shows they may not have the votes, and I think that puts us in good position because it gives us a chance to still accomplish what the election was about in 2016.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, Jonah Goldberg made a very interesting point on \"SPECIAL REPORT\" a few moments ago. He said that because of the way the budget rules work, you can't get anything through on reconciliation if you pass these huge increases in spending. Because in order to do a reconciliation deal, you have to prove that you're not going to add to the deficit dramatically over the next 10 years. So, he's saying that the Tea Party agenda is busted with this deal. Do you agree?</p><p>JORDAN: Well, I mean, I think this is entirely inconsistent with what Republicans are about, Tea Party Conservatives are about, and frankly, so many Americans across this country with just good common sense understand. You can't keep piling up deficits that this year will approach a trillion- dollar deficit. You can't keep adding to the debt, which is already at $20 trillion. And here's the other thing that's so important, just three weeks ago, Chuck Schumer shut down the government because he thought amnesty was more important for illegals than funding our military. Here we are with the same exact position funding our troops now just for the full year and doing what needs to be doing, and we're in such a good position to win and, yet, what's our leadership say? Oh, we're going to hatch a deal where we just keep growing government and keep doing the same old, same old that this town is so known for but the American people so despise.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think you're right that this is not a deal that, you know, people who looked at the election and said, OK, well now Republicans are going to be in charge of the White House, the House, and the Senate ever thought that they would see with absolutely no spending cuts anywhere and a lot of growth in spending and growth in government.</p><p>JORDAN: Yep.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Congressman, thank you. Good to see you as always.</p><p>JORDAN: You bet. Thank you.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, here now, Lisa Boothe and Richard Fowler, a Nationally Syndicated Talk Show Host and Senior Fellow at the New Leader's Council, both are Fox News Contributors. Welcome to both of you. I guess, you know, I want to get your reflections on both of these stories, really. So, Lisa, let me start with you. Your reaction when you look at these text messages and with the understanding that this is all sort of, you know, new information. We're still kind of figuring out what was going on here.</p><p>LISA BOOTHE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I mean, personally, I think the whole Russia-Trump collusion narrative sort of blew up when we found out that Hillary Clinton and the DNC were behind the Russian dossier. Because I think the narrative really just combusted with that, considering the fact that the Democrats were doing the exact same thing that they're accusing the Trump administration of doing. And it seems like every single day now, we continue to have information come forward that really raises questions about the individuals who've been pointing their fingers at the Trump administration for so long.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Richard, what do you think?</p><p>RICHARD FOWLER, FOX NEWS CHANNEL AND NATIONALLY SYNDICATED TALK SHOW HOST: Well, I think you have to separate the memo from what we know in these text from the Mueller investigation. There are two different tracts here. You have what's happening in the house, you have this GOP memo, and then you have the Mueller investigation. And there's thin layers, but no clear connection between the three. I think it's very interesting that we've seen these text messages. That you've got to give mark Warner credit for the fact that he was very open to the committee about it, he was very honest about it.</p><p>And the idea behind it was that he was trying to get Steele to sit down and have a conversation with this committee, so they could find out what Steele knew, which means this investigation is actually bipartisan because Democrats and Republicans are working together to figure out what Steele knew, what Republicans knew, what Don Jr. knew, everybody who is involved in this case, they are trying to bring to the table. And I think that is a big deal.</p><p>MACCALLUM: I think what's becoming abundantly clear, though, is that Russians were clearly trying to influence, you know, whoever they could get their hands on.</p><p>FOWLER: Absolutely.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They didn't care if it was Republicans or Democrats, right?</p><p>FOWLER: Absolutely. And I think the most -- the biggest revelation that we also heard from Ed Henry's reporting there is the fact that Manafort was selling access to Trump if he became president of the United States, which would speak to the reason as why he was invited under Mueller.</p><p>BOOTHE: That kind of sounds like the Clinton foundation to me.</p><p>FOWLER: Pardon?</p><p>BOOTHE: I said, well, we also had -- we also had with Hillary Clinton the Clinton Foundation clearly selling of access with Hillary Clinton.</p><p>FOWLER: Listen, I think like Martha just said --</p><p>BOOTHE: And President Trump fired Paul Manafort, rightfully so. Fired him.</p><p>FOWLER: Yes, but he was also the campaign chairman and he was now we know --</p><p>BOOTHE: Briefly.</p><p>FOWLER: -- based on this evidence, this reporting, that he was trying to get access to the White House.</p><p>MACCALLUM: No, he was pushed out. And, in fact, you know, has been indicted.</p><p>FOLWER: Absolutely.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, I mean, you know, he has to deal with his own relationship with Russia and who he was trying to make money off of in his position. That's all going to come out. Quick thought on, potentially, another shut down for the government, Lisa? And then Richard.</p><p>BOOTHE: You know, look, it's frustrating for the American people, you know. It seems like a government just cannot function and you've got Nancy Pelosi sort of holding us hostage. Once again, I think it's more for self- preservation than actually caring about getting a DACA deal done. There's been a lot of questions surrounding her time as being the minority leader in the house, and potentially that coming to an end. So, I think it's self-preservation --</p><p>MACCALLUM: Rand Paul trying to hold the hostage, so as Jim Jordan -- to be fair.</p><p>BOOTH: Nancy Pelosi wasn't on the floor for them, though, you know.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Richard, go ahead.</p><p>FOWLER: I think that's biggest story today, is what you see Rand Paul doing in the United States House of Representatives. And let me tell you this, ideologically, I'm opposed to pretty much everything Rand Paul agrees with, but I actually agree with him on this. I was watching the speech before I came on -- before I was on air. And the point he made to me that was a salient argument. You can't be against deficits yesterday and now for deficits today on want to fact that we could fund all of these programs, as he said in his speech, if we ended the endless war in Afghanistan and bring our troops home. We can give all of our troops a raise if we ended the pointless war in Afghanistan, which I think we all agree on both sides of the aisle that there's no chance of winning.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. Thank you very much. Good to see you all tonight. Lots going on. So, coming up next, stunning new allegations on a scandal that seems to have fallen offer the radar. But Hillary Clinton and Uranium One, when an FBI informant told Congress today that will make you wonder about this whole deal whether the Clinton's relationship was a lot more- friendly than we thought. We'll talk about it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: We want to reset our relationship.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Let's do it together.</p><p>CLINTON: So, we will do it together, OK?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, there are new details tonight about the alleged ties between the Clintons, Moscow, and highly controversial Uranium One deal. An FBI source on the Hill today, telling members of Congress that Russia paid millions of dollars to a U.S. Lobbying firm in hopes of influencing then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Peter Doocy with that story live on Capitol Hill tonight. Hi, Peter.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Martha, an FBI informant is now talking to congressional investigators about a paper trail that he says shows at least $750,000. Three quarters of a million dollars of Russian influence over then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The informant's name is Douglas Campbell and he claims that the Kremlin hired a lobbying firm called APCO Worldwide to essentially make Russian uranium more attractive to regulators.</p><p>Here's what Mr. Campbell, the informant, and whistleblower say: \"the contract called for four payments of $750,000 over 12 months. APCO was expected to give assistance free of charge to the Clinton Global Initiative as part of their effort to create a favorable environment to ensure the Obama administration made affirmative decisions on everything from Uranium One to the U.S.-Russia Civilian Nuclear Cooperation Agreement. But that lobbying firm now claims that that time line does not add up. APCO worldwide says this, APCO worldwide under took client work on behalf of Tenex in 2010 and 2011.</p><p>It undertook work from the Clinton global initiative from 2008-2016. These projects were totally separate and uncorrected in any way. All APCO's actions on these two unconnected activities were publicly documented from outset legally proper and entirely ethical. Any assertion otherwise is false and unfounded. The informant's attorney, though, Victoria Toensing, said this morning that something does not add up and she points to a questionable decision by the committee on foreign investment in the United States.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTORIA TOENSING, ATTORNEY FOR URANIUM ONE INFORMANT: What people really ought to be looking at is why was this CFIUS decision made? On its face, it's not a good decision. But when you consider the fact that Bill Clinton got $500,000 four months before the decision was made, and the Clinton foundation got $145 million from the people who gained when their stock rose after the Uranium One purchase wept through. I think it takes some looking into.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: The informant says that he went undercover, met with key players with a video camera, and that the FBI had seen the footage, so it does seem like all this threat about a grand global corruption scheme is just scratching the surface. Martha?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Interesting. Peter, thank you very much. Joining me now, David Bossie, President of Citizens United and a Fox News Contributor; and Marie Harf, a Fox News Analyst and Former State Department Spokesperson. So, Marie, that, you know, the take on the Democratic side of this equation is that this is old news, it's been dealt with, the time line is wrong. But, you know, in this guy Campbell spoke to these different panels today and told his story. He was an informant. He was there. So, isn't it legitimate to hear him out and see if there is anything to it?</p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS ANALYST AND FORMER OBAMA STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: Well, Martha, the FBI also determined that this informant was not credible and that's why they stopped working with him. They did not think he was giving them good information.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Christopher Steele, right?</p><p>HARF: And the --</p><p>MACCALLUM: I mean, no, it's the same, right?</p><p>HARF: It's totally different. But look, on Uranium One, there is also zero evidence that any of us have seen that Hillary Clinton was involved in any way with the decision to approve that deal -- there were nine members of the committee; they voted unanimously. Believe me, having worked at the State Department these CFIUS decisions are taken way below the secretary's level. And there is no evidence that she was involved in it in any way, shape, or form. And you heard the statement from APCO who said -- this lobbying firm, who said this isn't true.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes, no, that's all laid out pretty clearly. There are still hundreds of millions of dollars, David Bossie, that the Clintons and the Clinton foundation received from Russia. When you think about how panicked everyone is now about Russia, it's interesting to look back to that time period and say, wow, this was the reset period when President Obama was saying, you know, the 80's called, they want your foreign policy back. How silly it is to be any concern at all about Russia? And maybe that's more the frame in which all of this happened.</p><p>DAVID BOSSIE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR AND PRESIDENT OF CITIZENS UNITED: I think, Martha, that this is a very good question. What this person, informant is talking about, definitely needs to be looked into. But it needs to be part of a much bigger investigation into the Clinton foundation, the pay-for-play schemes. This $500,000 that Bill Clinton was receiving four months before the decision whether it's any other ancillary issues and big ones like the Clinton e-mail server. So, I've been calling for many months. And you and I have talked about this that we need to have a special counsel to investigate this.</p><p>And I think that this person's claims. These charges that he brings will be, -- should be investigated by an independent arbiter of the facts and let the chips fall where they may. And I would -- I think that that is the only way to get the American people to understand that the Clinton investigation because now we see between Loretta Lynch and all of the rest that it was swept under the rug by James Comey and others and I think that we need to have American people understanding this is a fair investigation.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yes. I mean, Marie, just in terms of the effort to, you know, open up business relationships at that point, right? That was clearly on the table and the encouragement of that, I think you do have to, you know, given the concerns that are out there today, look back at all of this and say were we kind of being played with some of this, no?</p><p>HARF: Well, I've said repeatedly and I will say again tonight, if I were the Clintons, I would not have run the foundation the way they did, given she was secretary of state and given she was definitely running for president. So, I am not going to defend that. But I'm also not going to defend the leap then to some sort of, you know, conspiracy theory by some out there that, you know, every dollar they got for something then went into the State Department in terms of influencing policy. I think that it was clear by 2016 that for many reasons the Russians hated Hillary Clinton and there are a lot of reasons behind that. And so, while we should get answers on all these other questions, looking forward, which is the most important thing, Russia is still threatening our democracy. We should focus on that more than anything else and how to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>BOSSIE: And I think part of that is that we need to find out what collusion the Clinton campaign had with the Russians. So -- because they were obviously paying for and financing the Steele dossier and working with the Russians. And look, Adam Schiff just got played by the Howard Stern of Russia, OK? So, we are seeing they're still so desperate.</p><p>MACCALLUM: They're clearly coming at all sides to see where the vulnerabilities might exist. Thanks, you guys. Great to see you both tonight.</p><p>HARF: Thanks, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So, disturbing allegations tonight about a former White House aide accused of abusing two of his ex-wives. But his resignation did not end the controversy. Now, the heat is turning up on General John Kelly. Is that fair? Is that right? Next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He just decided that the White male employee working for him couldn't possibly beat his former wives because he said he didn't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, THE STORY HOST: The White House under fire tonight over the lead up to the resignation of a senior aide after allegations surfaced that he was abusive to two of his ex-wives and a girlfriend. White House staff secretary Rob Porter has lost his job following the explosive claims of this abuse that first started to come to light on Tuesday. But there have been some report that some Trump administration officials including chief of staff John Kelly may have known about this for months. We don't know the extent of what they knew. But they did not make a move to remove him at that point. So the White House is strongly pushing back today, saying that General Kelly only learned the full extent yesterday. But that has not stopped many out there from going after him. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: He just decided that the white male employee working for him couldn't possibly beat his former wives because he said he didn't.</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Isn't it John Kelly's job if he doesn't have all the details to get them?</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: John Kelly, as to everyone in this administration, beating up a woman is not a disqualification.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Joined now by Ben Shapiro, editor-in-chief at dailywire.com who wrote about this today, and Ari Fleischer, former White House press secretary and a Fox News contributor. Gentlemen, great to have both of you with us today. Ben, you know, obviously, the underlying story here is ugly. It does not look good. And the more we learned about it today and went through some of these blogs and information that's out there is a big fall for Rob Porter. No doubt. He helped write the state of the union just a few days ago, and now he's lost his job. Your thoughts.</p><p>BEN SHAPIRO, DAILYWIRE.COM EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: No question. It's a major fall from him. But it seems like a fall that is well deserved from the credibility of the allegations and, of course, got multiple allegations from multiple different women. You have a police action that was filed against -- a temporary restraining order. The real question here is what did John Kelly know? And even if he only knew some of the allegation, why would he allow Rob Porter to get so close to the president? That really is the question to me because it's clear to me that from what Kelly has said, what the administration has said, he didn't, for example, have access to the photo of the ex-wife who was hit in the face. And once that came out he changed his story. But, when you're in doubt, you've got to keep the president safe from the impact of having someone around him who is going to take a fall like this. And it just seems irresponsible to me if you know anything about these stories to allow anyone with those allegations floating around about them to be that close to the president. It puts the president in a vulnerable position.</p><p>MACCALLUM: You know, it's tricky. And, obviously, the way that Ben presents it, Ari, you know, is from the national security perspective, which is absolutely a valid question to ask here. You know, from the personal side, when you read the account of his first wife, she talks about the fact that everyone loved Rob. That everybody always told her how lucky she was. That she was married to him, that he was such a great guy. This is clearly somebody who had a pretty good Jekyll and Hyde routine going.</p><p>ARI FLEISCHER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yeah. And I think that's explains why people at the White House said what they said about him. Look, this is human nature. It has nothing to do with whether you work at the White House, or worked in a school, or wherever you are. If there is somebody that you know, you admire, you like, you say that and it's reflected in what you think because that's how they behave in the office. They may have a totally separate way of acting when they go home and perhaps that's what the case is here. In all fairness to Rob Porter he has denied this and that is important. We do have to have two sides. And I think that would explain it then when people could be so shocked that he's such a great guy at the office. We don't know what he's like at home. And then you have to be precise in your language. When you say was he aware of this? What exactly is this? Is it that there's a picture of him with a wife who has a black eye or is it there's allegations of difficulties in a marriage and we don't know all the facts yet? This is where you just have to let the investigators really tell what do you know? What was precisely conveyed and said?</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yeah. Let's play a little bit of the news conference today at the White House talking about how they handled it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: I think it's fair to say that, you know, we all could have done better over the last few hours or last few days in dealing with the situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So the White House accepting some blame there, Ben?</p><p>SHAPIRO: I mean, I think that's exactly the right move. And it's one of the rare times I've seen the White House actually say, listen, we may have made a mistake here. You're going to buy an awful lot of credibility from the press and from public when you say, listen, we didn't have all the information. As we got all the information it became clear that we jumped the gun on this. And that, obviously, should have been their first response, is we're gathering all the information, these allegations are obviously very disturbing. I think the reason that John Kelly is in some trouble here is because he made such a strong defense of Rob Porter and then had to go back on it, but acknowledging when you make mistakes, you know, a lot of people in politic see that as a weakness. I think that's actually a strength when it comes to the P.R. efforts of the Trump White House.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Ben, in terms of the media reaction, there has been a real pile-on on General Kelly from what he said about DACA recipients earlier this week, that if they hadn't signed up, you know, maybe they were too lazy to sign up for the program. It feels like there's some long knives out for him.</p><p>SHAPIRO: It does feel like that. It feels like there's a feeling that John Kelly, if he's the guy who protecting the president, and if he's the guy who is not holding the president back, I think the press wanted Kelly to be the guy who is sort of holding a leash on Trump and, of course, that's not Kelly's job. Kelly's job is to organize the White House in a better way. It feels like there's some vulnerability for Kelly now and the press is jumping on it because they'd like to see the White House return to something more chaotic as it was earlier before Kelly sort of took the reign there.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Ari, last thought.</p><p>FLEISCHER: Yeah. I mean, that's exactly right what Ben said. I've been around Washington long enough to know that anytime somebody goes after staff they're really going after the boss. That's what this is about. This is a way of taking another shot at Donald Trump. Staffs are interchangeable. It doesn't matter who they are. You pick up the staffer and you go after them because you really want to take down the president. In this case, too, I think there's a lot of Democrats and the media who don't like John Kelly any longer. They liked him when he came in and created order, when he was an improvement. But now that they see he's ideologically conservative, you know, let's throw him out too. There's a lot of that going on.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. Gentlemen, thank you very much. Ben, Ari, good to see you both.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Thanks so much.</p><p>MACCALLUM: So if the past is any indication, Democrats should expect to win more seats in the 2018 midterms. Generally that's what happens. So why are the poll numbers going down and Republicans are going up a bit here? What it might mean when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I think we're going to do well in '18. I think we're going to do very well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: So here is a headline that's getting some political attention tonight, quote, improving poll numbers give Republicans hope that the midterms might not be so bad. According to the Real Clear Politics average, Democrats lead in the generic congressional matchup have been shrinking a bit. But when it comes to individual races, the story is different with the Cook Political report shifting 21 house races towards the Democrats today. So here to help figure this out our friend, Tom Bevan, co-founder and publisher of Real Clear Politics. Tom, good to see you. Obviously, it's a long way out and a lot can happen. But the people who are doing fundraising and who are looking to recruit people for these races are watching these numbers very closely, right?</p><p>TOM BEVAN, REAL CLEAR POLITICS PUBLISHER: Absolutely. And, look, there are sort of the macro indicators. You mentioned the generic ballot Trump's approval rating, right track, wrong direction. Those are sort of the macro-numbers -- the indicators that you look at. But at the district level you're right. I mean, Democrats have had very strong recruiting efforts over the past few months and this last release of fundraising numbers they're in a very strong position. And so, I think on a district by district level basis, Democrats are in a pretty good position.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Yeah. I mean, you have to watch for that enthusiasm and the intensity. And as you point out, recruiting -- I think they have more -- I think far more female candidates than Republicans do. They have a lot of military candidates. So it looks like they're looking to, sort of, hone in on places where some people who voted for President Trump or the Republican candidate last time around might be convinced to be pulled across.</p><p>EBEVAN: exactly. There are, I think, 23 districts that Hillary Clinton won in 2016 where Republican incumbents are battling to hold on. So this is going to be certainly, historically speaking, Republicans are sort of up against it in the house. And they are facing an enthusiasm gap with Democrats right now. But, what they do have on their side, we've seen improving numbers on the economy, on the tax cut. I think that's what help contributed to the decrease in the generic ballot number. And they've also got redistricting in 2010 helped them shore up some of these marshal districts which puts them in a bit stronger position than they may otherwise have been.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Let's take a look. You have three races that you think are the top races to watch right now, California 39, Illinois 6, and Virginia 10. Why are those -- and Barbara Comstock who is at the end of that list, we saw her arguing in favor of not shutting down the government because most of her district works for the government, right?</p><p>BEVAN: Right. So I picked one in the west. Obviously, the road to a Democratic majority runs through California, Southern California, particularly. A lot of competitive races there. But Ed Royce's district - - this is a district Clinton won. He's retiring. It's an open seat. It's one of the Dem's best pickup opportunity. Peter Rostrum here in Illinois, he is a guy who in 2006, when all of the Republicans were getting wiped out, he won. So if Peter Rostrum is in trouble at any point in this cycle, the Republicans might be in for a really rough ride. And then, Barbara Comstock, you mention, she's been targeted, probably, the most vulnerable Republican incumbent right now. And again, this battle, Martha, is mostly going to be fought in the suburbs around the country and where Democrats have -- they found success in 2016 with well-educated suburbanites, and the question whether they're able to make inroads there in the districts where Hillary Clinton won. But -- or whether Republicans can sort of fend them off.</p><p>MACCALLUM: As you point out, the economy ticking up and the tax reform is what Republicans hope will save the day for them, so we'll see how close. Tom, thank you very much. Good to see you tonight.</p><p>BEVAN: You bet.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Up next, do you remember this moment?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Tobacco is a risky product which should be restricted to adults.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Big tobacco CEO's forced to admit the dangers of their products in the late 90's.

Welcome to both of you.</p><p>You know, I have long-said that cell phones and all of these apps and all of this communication is the smoking of our age. Even to the point where people use them the same way, right? An awkward moment used to be a time when somebody would light up a cigarette, right? But now, what do you do? You look at your phone on the elevator or at a restaurant. Now everybody picks up their phone because they're not smoking cigarettes anymore. It's bizarre the connection, Steve.</p><p>STEVE HILTON, NEXT REVOLUTION HOST: That's exactly right, Martha. And the thing that everyone has to understand is that addiction that you describe, that is part of the Silicon Valley business model, it's at the core of what they do. I run a tech company out here in Silicon Valley. And I remember when I was raising money for my start up, the venture capital folk that's you're pitching to they literally ask you the question how are you going to make it addictive? They use that exact word because that's how they generate the returns that they want to see. And the trouble is it's causing real disaster in our society and families and people's relationships, but especially amongst children where research has just shown us now the really damaging effect that all this addiction has particularly on young people. It's a social disaster in the making. We have to do something about this.</p><p>MACCALLUM: It's so destructive. And yet they talk about FOMO, fear of missing out. And it glues them literally to their phones, and they have to keep in touch with each other or they lose the chain from one person to another. And they think it's fun but they're kids. And they don't realize how much it's addicting them. Wendy, you know, in terms of regulation, what form will that take?</p><p>WENDY OSEFO, POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: You know, I think it has to take some sort of regulation because the kids are really the big issue here. We have an issue when it comes to this digital identity crisis within our nation, and for children they start to feel depressed when they see things on social media and believe that art is imitating life. And going beyond just them feeling depressed. It even transcends to suicide. We see that 48 percent of children who use social media more than five hours a day commit suicide compared to 28 percent who only use it one hour a day. So the policies that we set forth really have to change the ways in which these social media agents are allowing our children do use their phones. What I think is really important here is we have to underscore that social media has been good to small businesses, but it has completely disseminated the fabric of personal relationship and it can really just quell all the issues of our social fabric. So we have to keep that in mind.</p><p>MACCALLUM: There's also a political indoctrination which has come more to the forefront now as well, Steve. And they're changing the news feed and they had less view, right?</p><p>HILTON: That's exactly right. And also, you see the way that bringing those two points together, the addiction and the kind of biased information. You just today, we saw reporting in the Wall Street Journal about how YouTube are feeding people videos based on their algorithms. They actually take them further in the direction of extreme content and conspiracy theories, and it's really distorting our political debates. There's just one thing I'd like to say about the regulation. I've been arguing for many years that actually for children we should treat exactly like smoking and ban smart phones for children. I think all parents.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Amen to that.</p><p>HILTON: . would welcome that. It would actually help them enforce the rules.</p><p>MACCALLUM: All right. We've got to go. We could talk forever about this. Thank you, guys. Come back.</p><p>OSEFO: Thank you, Martha.</p><p>MACCALLUM: Quick break and we'll be right back with more on The Story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Would you give me one minute.</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED FEMALE: You know that I can't do that. That's not how.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE)</p><p>UNINDENTIFIED MALE: Stay down.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACCALLUM: Everybody in that room understood where that came from. That moment from Randy Margraves, dad to three of Larry Nassar's victims, clearly got everybody's attention. He was held by the authorities as you can see briefly, and almost instantly a Go Fund Me page popped up with people who were happy to help pay for any legal fees he might incur. He was released. He did not face any charges. They understood what this man was going through, but the page raised over $30,000. So tonight, he says he's giving the money to charities that help victims of sexual abuse. Writing this, at the time of the incident, I didn't know that the great brotherhood had done this and I was overcome with gratitude when I found out. I appreciate everyone stepping up to support me, but help is not needed for me. So he's helping others. That is The Story for tonight. Thanks for being here, everybody. We will see you back here tomorrow night at 7:00 PM. Tucker Carlson is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect's business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.''</p><p>  That is quite a different characterization than the one House Democrats gave. They wrote:</p><p>  ''G.S.A. assesses that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington, D.C., hotel. The deputy commissioner made clear that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well.''</p><p>  The problem is fairly straightforward. Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will soon be in charge of the agency that issued the lease for the Old Post Office Building, which the president-elect transformed unto a luxury hotel. He will also appoint the head of the G.S.A. To avoid such an obvious conflict, the lease that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>signed states: ''No ... elected official of the government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom[.]''</p><p>  No word yet from Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>about how he will proceed. Not even the G.S.A.'s deputy commissioner of public building services has heard a peep in response.</p><p>  ''In fact, the deputy commissioner informed our staffs that the G.S.A. has received no communications to date from Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>business organization about this issue. This raises serious questions about how Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>plans to proceed.''</p><p>  But the G.S.A. is not exactly saying all is fine with the hotel. More like, let's wait until Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>is actually sworn in.</p><p>  Could <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>national security adviser be denied a security clearance?</p><p>  Two Democratic senators are raising a new issue about Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.</p><p>  His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that ''creates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,'' the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>  The choice of Mr. Flynn, 57, a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to serve as national security adviser has already faced widespread criticism. The job does not require congressional confirmation, and Mr. Flynn's views on a range of subjects -- from the threat posed by radical Islam and Iran to his penchant for conspiracy theories and his belief that the Obama administration has politicized the Central Intelligence Agency -- tend to hew to the right-wing fringes of Republican Party.</p><p>  He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network's lavish anniversary party in Moscow.</p><p>  In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.</p><p>  But it is Mr. Flynn's business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators' letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.</p><p>  But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.</p><p>  ''Any share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,'' Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.</p><p>  Senate Democrats tell Betsy DeVos: Pay your election fines.</p><p>  Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.</p><p>  Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Wednesday called on Ms. DeVos to pay $5.3 million in fines and penalties owed by her All Children Matter political action committee for campaign finance violations dating to 2008.</p><p>  All Children Matter broke Ohio election law by illegally sending $870,000 from its national PAC to its Ohio affiliate. The state of Ohio levied a record fine against the group.</p><p>  But the debt remains unpaid, the senators said. And now a confirmation vote looms.</p><p>  Beefing up his billionaires.</p><p>  Two billionaire Silicon Valley executives, Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, and Travis Kalanick of Uber, joined Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>roster of major American business advisers.</p><p>  The addition of Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick to Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>Strategic and Policy Forum bring big technology names to the inner circle of Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>transition that has had little engagement so far with Silicon Valley, except for the vocal support of the tech investor Peter Thiel.</p><p>  Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick engaged closely with the Obama administration, and their companies have increased their lobbying presence in Washington in recent years. Mr. Musk's electric car company, Tesla, and his other firms, including Solar City and SpaceX, have been criticized by rivals for using federal and state subsidies. Uber, Mr. Kalanick's ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.</p><p>  The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman and co-founder of the investment firm the Blackstone Group, the <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>transition team announced Wednesday. The group is charged with providing Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>relationship with the tech sector has been tense. His election was greeted with dismay by many in Silicon Valley, who supported the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the internet policy of net neutrality, and an increase in the immigration of highly skilled workers. Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>has promised to unroll all of those efforts.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>singled out Apple for manufacturing parts of their devices abroad. He also criticized Amazon for its dominance, and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, for owning The Washington Post, which he said had been unfair in its campaign coverage of him.</p><p>  The announcement that Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick were joining his business policy group came ahead of a meeting with several tech leaders at <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>Tower on Wednesday, including Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer.</p><p>  A singular focus: jobs, jobs, jobs.</p><p>  To Mr. <person><nameText>Trump, </nameText></person>the job of the president is to focus on jobs. Virtually everything else is subservient to that: diplomacy, science, conservation.</p><p>  On Wednesday, he officially tapped former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas to lead the Department of Energy, an agency whose primary tasks are to maintain the safety and reliability of the nation's nuclear arsenal, counter nuclear proliferation, clean up Cold War radiation contamination and pursue basic science through the government's premier research laboratories.</p><p>  His announcement, language errors and all, mentioned none of those:</p><p>  ''As the governor of Texas, Rick Perry created created a business climate that produced millions of new jobs and lower energy prices in his state, and he will bring that same approach to our entire country as secretary of energy,'' said President-elect <person><nameText>Trump. </nameText></person>''My administration is going to make sure we take advantage of our huge natural resource deposits to make America energy independent and create vast new wealth for our nation.''</p><p>  After a rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday night, he thanked Wisconsin and reiterated his jobs message.</p><p>  Thank you Wisconsin! My Administration will be focused on three very important words: jobs, jobs, jobs!

Tillerson for secretary of state, the Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, and the fast-food executive Andrew F. Puzder for labor secretary should be seen.</p><p>  Speaking of jobs ...</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will meet on Wednesday with leaders of the technology industry, including Mr. Cook, Mr. Musk, Mr. Bezos and Ms. Sandberg. The agenda? Creating jobs.</p><p>  As Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>prepares to meet with Big Tech, 19 organizations from the music industry, including the Americana Music Association, sent him a letter expressing their concern about content theft over shared platforms.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>is familiar with musicians' concerns about using music without permission -- he was criticized during his campaign by artists who did not want their songs played at his rallies.</p><p><person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>eyes 'Bridgegate' figure for White House team.</p><p>  The monumental traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge may have made Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey lie low -- and thwarted his chances of getting a cabinet post for him. But it appears to have not affected the prospects of a former Christie aide, Bill Stepien, who mentored the central actors of the ''Bridgegate'' scandal.</p><p>  Mr. Stepien is now the leading contender to be the White House political director.</p><p>  Two people close to the transition said that Mr. Stepien, who was hired by Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, after the final campaign shake-up, has been repeatedly mentioned for the role, although the decision is not final.</p><p>  Bridgegate aside, Mr. Stepien is credited by some of Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>closest advisers with helping him improve his field organization in crucial states, and contributing to his victory.</p><p><person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>team picks singer for inauguration. You may not know her.</p><p>  Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>has chosen (who else?) a television star to sing the national anthem at his inauguration on Jan. 20.</p><p>  Honored to have @jackieevancho performing the National Anthem at the @TrumpInaugural Ceremony. She's an inspiration for all Americans! #MAGA -- Boris Epshteyn (@BorisEP) December 14, 2016</p><p>  Jackie Evancho, a 16-year-old singer who gained popularity as a contestant on ''America's Got Talent,'' said on Wednesday that it was ''a great honor'' to be asked to perform by Mr. <person><nameText>Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>  Hers is the first name released by the inaugural planning committee for a day that typically features high-wattage star power. President Obama had Beyonc\u00c3\u00a9 perform the anthem in 2013, and asked other high-profile artists like Aretha Franklin and James Taylor to deliver supplementary performances at his inaugurations. But there have been reports Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>is struggling to secure big-league talent after a bruising campaign in which the celebrity class largely turned out to support his opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p><p>  Ms. Evancho met Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>at Mar-a-Lago, his resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in 2011, after she had finished as the runner-up on ''America's Got Talent,'' NBC's hit series. She was 10 at the time.</p><p>  ''I'm so excited; it's going to be awesome,'' she said after making the announcement on NBC's ''Today'' show.</p><p>  Ms. Evancho, of course, is too young to vote.</p><p>  Nancy Pelosi calls for independent inquiry into Russian election interference.</p><p>  As evidence mounts of a wide-reaching effort by Russian intelligence agents to help elect not only Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>but also Republicans in Congress, Ms. Nancy Pelosi, of California, called for an independent investigation of foreign interference in the 2016 election.</p><p>  One day after top congressional Republicans said an investigation was necessary, Ms. Pelosi questioned their conviction. ''That's a statement of fact,'' she told reporters. ''That's not a statement of action.''</p><p>  She said a panel of outside investigators with subpoena power needed to be convened.</p><p>  ''The people have a right to know why Republicans are afraid of the truth,'' Ms. Pelosi said.</p><p>  Almost everyone thinks <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will help his businesses while in office.</p><p>  Whether or not that is a good thing depends on your political affiliation:</p><p>  ''A Morning Consult/Politico survey conducted Dec. 8-11 found that 81 percent of voters say it is likely <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will take actions to benefit his businesses when he becomes president next month. And while there is much agreement there, voters were split along partisan lines on whether it was good or bad for his business interests to affect his decision-making as president: 39 percent of voters said it was mainly a good thing, including 73 percent of Republicans, and 44 percent said it was mainly a bad thing, including 73 percent of Democrats.''</p><p>  Get politics and Washington news updates via Facebook, Twitter and in the Morning Briefing newsletter.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-211702161215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MD4-VJK1-JBG3-62V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2446\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>The New York Times on the Web</edition><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/14/us/politics/donald-trump-transition.html</url><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 15, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GENERAL SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Contracts Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY0RTZFMzE0RjkwNDdFQUI5M0U5N0ZFMjYyREMyQzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODY5MDQzNkRBODFFNEY1REE5Q0UyNDQxRkVCNzY4NTE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDcyMDg3OEYyNEFFNEYxMDgxREM4MUY1QkU3NEM5QzY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001996</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp;

We can make no definitive statement at this time about what would constitute a breach of the agreement, and to do so now would be premature. In fact, no determination regarding the Old Post Office can be completed until the full circumstances surrounding the President-elect's business arrangements have been finalized and he has assumed office.\"</p><p>That is quite a different characterization than the one House Democrats gave. They wrote:</p><p>\"G.S.A. assesses that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will be in breach of the lease agreement the moment he takes office on Jan. 20, 2017, unless he fully divests himself of all financial interests in the lease for the Washington, D.C., hotel. The deputy commissioner made clear that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>must divest himself not only of managerial control, but of all ownership interest as well.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.govexec.com/excellence/promising-practices/2016/11/gsas-trump-hotel-lease-debacle/133424/\">The problem is fairly straightforward.</url> Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>will soon be in charge of the agency that issued the lease for the Old Post Office Building, which the president-elect transformed unto a luxury hotel. He will also appoint the head of the G.S.A. To avoid such an obvious conflict, the lease that Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>signed states: \"No ... elected official of the government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom[.]\"</p><p>No word yet from Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>about how he will proceed. Not even the G.S.A.'s deputy commissioner of public building services has heard a peep in response.</p><p>\"In fact, the deputy commissioner informed our staffs that the G.S.A. has received no communications to date from Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>business organization about this issue. This raises serious questions about how Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>plans to proceed.\"</p><p>But the G.S.A. is not exactly saying all is fine with the hotel.

Gen. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>choice for national security adviser: They are questioning whether he should be allowed to hold a security clearance, citing past investigations into charges that Mr. Flynn leaked classified information and into potential conflicts presented by a private intelligence firm he owns.</p><p>His business, the Flynn Intel Group, has hazy ties to Middle Eastern countries and has appeared to lobby for the Turkish government, and that \"creates potential for pressure, coercion and exploitation by foreign agents,\" the two senators, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, said in a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Office of Personnel Management.</p><p>The choice of Mr. Flynn, 57, a <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/us/politics/in-national-security-adviser-michael-flynn-experience-meets-a-prickly-past.html\">former director</url>of the Defense Intelligence Agency, to serve as national security adviser has already       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/us/politics/michael-flynn-son-trump.html\">faced widespread criticism</url>. The job does not require congressional confirmation, and Mr. Flynn's views on a range of subjects - from the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/us/politics/michael-flynn-national-security-adviser-donald-trump.html\">threat posed by radical Islam</url> and Iran to his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/us/politics/-michael-flynn-trump-fake-news-clinton.html\">penchant for conspiracy theories</url> and his belief that the Obama administration has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/politics/donald-trump-cia-michael-flynn.html\">politicized the Central Intelligence Agency</url> - tend to hew to the right-wing fringes of Republican Party.</p><p>He also took a paid speaking engagement last year with Russia Today, a television network funded by the Kremlin, and sat next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at the network's lavish anniversary party in Moscow.</p><p>In addition, Mr. Flynn was investigated, but cleared of any wrongdoing, in 2010 for sharing sensitive data with Pakistan about the Haqqani network, a faction of the Taliban, and for providing highly classified intelligence to British and Australian forces fighting in Afghanistan.</p><p>But it is Mr. Flynn's business relationships that remain unresolved. He has said he plans to step back from the Flynn Intel Group and let his son, Michael G. Flynn, run it, according to the senators' letter, which was provided to The New York Times before its release on Wednesday.</p><p>But that still does not settle the issue, the senators said.</p><p>\"Any share of partnership profits he obtains from the Flynn Intel Group that are derived from its representation of a foreign government would appear to be a violation of his obligation as a retired general to abide by the emoluments clause of the constitution,\" Mr. Blumenthal and Ms. Shaheen wrote.</p><p>Senate Democrats tell Betsy DeVos: Pay your election fines.</p><p>Senate Democrats have found a new bit of leverage against Ms. DeVos, the Michigan Republican Party leader who will soon be considered for the cabinet post of education secretary: her unpaid fines for campaign finance violations.</p><p>Senators Tom Udall of New Mexico, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Edward J.

The state of Ohio levied a record fine against the group.</p><p>But the debt remains unpaid, the senators said. And now a confirmation vote looms.</p><p>Beefing up his billionaires.</p><p>Two billionaire Silicon Valley executives, Elon Musk of SpaceX and Tesla, and Travis Kalanick of Uber, joined Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>roster of major American business advisers.</p><p>The addition of Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick to Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>Strategic and Policy Forum bring big technology names to the inner circle of Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>transition that has had little engagement so far with Silicon Valley, except for the vocal support of the tech investor Peter Thiel.</p><p>Mr. Musk and Mr. Kalanick engaged closely with the Obama administration, and their companies have increased their lobbying presence in Washington in recent years.

Uber, Mr. Kalanick's ride-hailing business, has roiled the taxi industry and fought municipalities around the world for new regulations that allow it to operate.</p><p>The forum, which includes the heads of Walt Disney and General Motors, will be led by Stephen A.

The group is charged with providing Mr. <person><nameText>Trump </nameText></person>with their individual views on how regulations affect jobs and economic growth.</p><p>Mr. <person><nameText>Trump's </nameText></person>relationship with the tech sector has been tense. His election was greeted with dismay by many in Silicon Valley, who supported the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the internet policy of <url normalizedValue=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/net_neutrality/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">net neutrality</url>, and an increase in the immigration of highly skilled workers.

Massachusetts liberal Ed Markey has teamed up with Missouri conservative Josh Hawley to sponsor an online privacy bill. Even Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump have found a common target in tech, each jabbing the industry over a series of perceived misdeeds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From the most conservative free market Republicans to staunchly progressive Democrats, the desire to rein in the tech sector has created surprising new partnerships among political enemies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Democrats have long counted Silicon Valley as part of their political base, while Republicans have pushed for a hands-off approach to tech innovation. But in Washington, the distrust from both parties regarding how the tech industry has handled itself on everything from privacy to political discourse makes it clear that Congress is hungry to bring about a tougher era of government regulation.</p><p>\"I think we've reached a tipping point. I think it's a sign there's really no going back from here,\" said Michelle Richardson, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology's Privacy and Data Project. \"The interest here is deep and will be long-term and there's no way we're going to get out of having some federal regulation on some of these issues.\"</p><p>Specific issues that have already drawn cross-party buy-in run the gamut from antitrust enforcement to bolstering publishers' power against tech platforms to the protection of children's data. Nearly all, however boil down to a central concern over tech giants' market power as well as the outside command that power gives them over both the terms of online conversation and the handling of Americans' most private information.</p><p>That shared concern could seriously boost the prospects of not just the targeted bills that odd couples have produced so far, but also more sweeping legislation aimed at reining in tech titans like Facebook, Google and Amazon, particularly with respect to their vast scale and power and their data practices. And it lends heft to 2020 presidential aspirants' pledges to crack down on Silicon Valley, as Democratic candidates like Sens. Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) already find themselves developing common cause across the aisle on tech issues.</p><p>\"I think all of these issues relate to getting the economy to work for the American people, respond to these tremendous concentrations of economic power and the enormous dominance of certain technology platforms,\" Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), who's sought to work on tech policy with conservative Republicans including Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Doug Collins (Ga.), told POLITICO. \"It's not just one group, Republican or Democrat or independent; it's being felt by the American people.\"</p><p>The point of unity between Warren and Cruz (R-Texas) was more a one-off than a concerted legislative effort. But it still proved striking given the participants, as a leading figure of the Democratic left and a famously prickly, firmly conservative Republican found major rhetorical overlap in their views of social media. Warren last month took issue with a POLITICO report that Facebook briefly took down a few of her campaign ads calling for the breakup of the company, saying it showed the social network \"has too much power.\" Cruz found himself leaping to her defense.</p><p>\"First time I've ever retweeted @ewarren  But she's right-Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech,\" Cruz tweeted in response to the post, adding that the company posed \"a serious threat to our democracy.\" Weeks later the Texas Republican quoted Warren's tweet at a Senate Judiciary hearing on allegations of an anti-conservative bias in tech - another first for the pair of lawmakers. </p><p>The trend encompasses both houses of Congress, and the Senate in particular has seen a number of unexpected partnerships form as part of a push to craft new rules for how companies handle consumer data.</p><p>One such odd pairing: Markey (D-Mass.), a liberal privacy hawk who has embraced the Democratic Party's rising progressive flank, and Hawley (R-Mo.), a prominent GOP tech critic who fashions himself a libertarian-leaning conservative.</p><p>Despite their other policy differences, the lawmakers recently joined to unveil a broad-reaching bipartisan measure to expand children's privacy protections. In rolling out their bill, Markey framed the topic as a rare area of consensus for lawmakers on Capitol Hill. \"If we can agree on anything, it should be that children deserve strong and effective protections online,\" he said in a statement. </p><p>Meanwhile, a number of other cross-party Senate pairings - including Sens. Klobuchar and John Neely Kennedy (R-La.) and Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). - have teamed up to unveil their own bipartisan data privacy bills, as lawmakers in both houses talk up plans to address the issue.</p><p>The privacy concerns are emblematic of broader shared scrutiny over tech's unchecked power. Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Klobuchar recently sent a joint letter to the Federal Trade Commission voicing concern about \"potential privacy, data security, and antitrust violations\" by tech titans. </p><p>In the House, Cicilline has been one of the more vocal lawmakers in highlighting the opportunity for meaningful bipartisan cooperation on tech. He recently teamed up with Collins, the House Judiciary Committee's top Republican, to reintroduce a bill that would give news publishers greater leverage to negotiate how online platforms distribute their content. The measure would amend existing antitrust statutes to grant publishers safe harbor to negotiate collectively with large platforms like Facebook and Google. </p><p>And Cicilline has even found common ground with Gaetz, a Trump surrogate who's made his name on winding up liberals, despite the two lawmakers trading blows on Twitter over other issues on which they're diametrically opposed. Cicilline is primarily concerned about anti-competitive practices by Google and Facebook, while Gaetz has spearheaded allegations that the internet giants suppress conservative views. But they've quietly discussed working together on tech issues, including, Gaetz says, in a series of one-on-one huddles on the House floor.</p><p>\"Mr. Cicilline and I disagree on some issues. We agree on others. This is one where I think we will find agreement,\" Gaetz told POLITICO.</p><p>A Cicilline spokesperson confirmed the lawmaker has \"discussed tech-related issues with Gaetz directly,\" and Cicilline said he and his staff are in \"constant communication\" with House Judiciary Republicans and their teams, including Gaetz's, on tech issues. </p><p>The charge of anti-conservative bias in tech championed by Gaetz in recent years has risen from a fringe right-wing talking point to the highest levels of the Republican Party, with Trump emerging as a consistent critic.</p><p>The president on Tuesday again raised allegations that his favorite social media platform, Twitter, suppresses conservative viewpoints, accusing them of playing \"political games\" with their content moderation decisions.</p><p>\"They don't treat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory, hard for people to sign on. Constantly taking people off list,\" Trump said in a pair of tweets, adding: \"No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD!\"</p><p>To be sure, given the broader partisan division that's gripped Washington, some are cautious in considering whether the curious alliances will actually succeed in delivering meaningful regulation for the tech industry.</p><p>\"They're bedfellows, maybe, but it's like a king-sized bed. I think there's still a fair of room between them on a fair amount of issues,\" said Justin Brookman, director of consumer privacy and technology policy Consumer Reports. \"Certainly you're seeing the rhetoric align a little more, and that's important. But whether we'll see action? We'll see.\"</p><p>But Brookman added that \"common rhetoric and acknowledgment of the problem is a really important first step\" toward concrete legislation. \"The first step is a common understanding that there's a problem, and we're definitely seeing a lot more of that,\" he said.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-986305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYR-65V1-JDJ6-K1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><timeReceived>9:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 24, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Senator Amy Klobuchar claimed we were living through 'another gilded age.' 'In sector after sector' Bernie Sanders added, 'we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies.' </p><p>Last week's Democratic debate[2] showed a clear conventional wisdom in that party: America's economy is besieged by a monopoly problem. Markets are said to be dominated by ever smaller numbers of firms enjoying rising markups of price over cost. Consumers are supposedly suffering higher prices and less innovation while competitorsstruggle to stay afloat because of behemoth anticompetitive behavior. The explanation? Supposedly a turn away from anti-monopoly policies over recent decades. Warren buys into the idea that antitrust laws have not been rigorously enforced. And she and others want the federal government to break up or more tightly regulate massive companies. Yet, increasingly, new academic evidence shows meaningful choice has not fallen in most sectors. In fact, the economic trends we do see appear to arise not because of weakly enforced antitrust laws, but because of an ongoing 'industrial revolution in services' that is good for consumers. Back in 2016, President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors[3] started the narrative about rising 'concentration' of industries. Its work concluded that revenue shares of the top 50 firms in ten of 13 very broad sectors had risen between 1997 and 2012. This was not necessarily evidence of weakened competition or harm to consumers, they admitted, but such findings allowed the myth of rising monopoly power to take hold. Such broad industry categories were clearly absurd for thinking about meaningful competition, however. Groupings such as 'Real Estate' or 'Retail' meant assessing Walmart, IKEA, McDonald's, and Foot Locker as if they were in the same industry, even though these companies don't meaningfully compete. But the truth is, even narrower industrial classifications at a national level are not particularly helpful. Most real 'markets' are incredibly local. When buying toothpaste, you might purchase from a local CVS, Safeway, Walmart, independent pharmacies, or order online from Amazon or elsewhere. A national concentration of the top 4 pharmacies' market share says nothing about options in an individual city. Suppose Starbucks opened a new outlet in a rural town, reducing the strength of a local monopolistic caf. Meaningful choice will have risen for consumers if the caf remains open too, but Starbucks' new outlet would suggest rising national concentration in the sector. Observing national concentration measures, and presuming them a proxy for consumer welfare (which most economists would warn against anyway), would scream a problem. But locally, competition and choice would have improved. This is, in fact, what has happened across America. A report by economists[4] at Princeton and the Richmond Fed last year confirmed that national concentration has indeed increased across many industries. Yet in sectors accounting for 72 percent of employment and 66 percent of sales, concentration fell in narrower geographical market territories, such as urban areas, county, or ZIP code levels. When Walmart opens a new store, for example, they found local concentration tends to fall and the number of stores in the local discount department store sector rises, on average, despite the giant's national market share increasing. What's happening is that top firms are investing in new information technology, finding efficiencies to serve more local markets[5]. Investments in productive high fixed cost IT are delivering standardization, reducing the costs of serving more locations. National concentration trends are therefore arising for 'good reasons,' not anticompetitive behavior. Cheesecake Factory, for example, has invested in technologies that help in improving staffing management, food purchasing, and menu adaptation, allowing them to roll out menu items nationwide in just 7 weeks. Hospital chains, and other service, retail, and wholesale industries are seeing market leaders proliferate geographically too. Employment is rising in industries that are becoming more highly concentrated nationally, suggesting that this isn't a story about 'monopoly power' constraining output and raising prices. Instead, what we're seeing is the most productive firms serving more places. Economists who coined the term 'the industrial revolution in services' estimate that a full 93 percent of the growth in concentration across national industries comes from large firms serving more localities. Choice on the ground then is improving, and big tech is part of that story too. Facebook and Google are giving businesses a new outlet for their adverts, and in turntaking more national advertising market share themselves. But their entry is meaningful competition to local adverts on billboards, TV, and in newspapers. Amazon is providing huge efficiencies in retail too, competing with a range of local stores, and facilitating broader competition through hosting third-party sellers. Yes, national concentration has risen. And, yes, many markups have too. But it's the adoption of new technologies lowering top firms' costs of expansion that explains these trends, not underenforced antitrust, or firms raising prices. If correct, this new evidence suggests we don't need to give more power to regulators, nordo we need a revival of some broader antitrust. What we need, as Google's chief economist Hal Varian[6] has intimated, is time to allow these technologies to diffuse through the economy. It takes time for entry in relation to higher markups and for new technologies to become cost effective for other firms to adopt them. When they do, these technological changes will result in widespread efficiencies, and lower prices still.

Consumers are supposedly suffering higher prices and less innovation while competitors struggle to stay afloat because of behemoth anticompetitive behavior. The explanation? Supposedly a turn away from anti-monopoly policies over recent decades. Warren buys into the idea that antitrust laws have not been rigorously enforced. And she and others want the federal government to break up or more tightly regulate massive companies.</p><p>Yet, increasingly, new academic evidence shows meaningful choice has not fallen in most sectors. In fact, the economic trends we do see appear to arise not because of weakly enforced antitrust laws, but because of an ongoing \"industrial revolution in services\" that is good for consumers.</p><p>Back in 2016, President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors started the narrative about rising \"concentration\" of industries. Its work concluded that revenue shares of the top 50 firms in ten of 13 very broad sectors had risen between 1997 and 2012. This was not necessarily evidence of weakened competition or harm to consumers, they admitted, but such findings allowed the myth of rising monopoly power to take hold.</p><p>Such broad industry categories were clearly absurd for thinking about meaningful competition, however. Groupings such as \"Real Estate\" or \"Retail\" meant assessing Walmart, IKEA, McDonald's, and Foot Locker as if they were in the same industry, even though these companies don't meaningfully compete.</p><p>But the truth is, even narrower industrial classifications at a national level are not particularly helpful. Most real \"markets\" are incredibly local. When buying toothpaste, you might purchase from a local CVS, Safeway, Walmart, independent pharmacies, or order online from Amazon or elsewhere. A national concentration of the top 4 pharmacies' market share says nothing about options in an individual city.</p><p>Suppose Starbucks opened a new outlet in a rural town, reducing the strength of a local monopolistic cafe. Meaningful choice will have risen for consumers if the cafe remains open too, but Starbucks' new outlet would suggest rising national concentration in the sector. Observing national concentration measures, and presuming them a proxy for consumer welfare (which most economists would warn against anyway), would scream a problem. But locally, competition and choice would have improved.</p><p>This is, in fact, what has happened across America. A report by economists at Princeton and the Richmond Fed last year confirmed that national concentration has indeed increased across many industries. Yet in sectors accounting for 72 percent of employment and 66 percent of sales, concentration fell in narrower geographical market territories, such as urban areas, county, or ZIP code levels. When Walmart opens a new store, for example, they found local concentration tends to fall and the number of stores in the local discount department store sector rises, on average, despite the giant's national market share increasing.</p><p>What's happening is that top firms are investing in new information technology, finding efficiencies to serve more local markets. Investments in productive high fixed cost IT are delivering standardization, reducing the costs of serving more locations. National concentration trends are therefore arising for \"good reasons,\" not anticompetitive behavior. Cheesecake Factory, for example, has invested in technologies that help in improving staffing management, food purchasing, and menu adaptation, allowing them to roll out menu items nationwide in just 7 weeks.</p><p>Hospital chains, and other service, retail, and wholesale industries are seeing market leaders proliferate geographically too. Employment is rising in industries that are becoming more highly concentrated nationally, suggesting that this isn't a story about \"monopoly power\" constraining output and raising prices. Instead, what we're seeing is the most productive firms serving more places. Economists who coined the term \"the industrial revolution in services\" estimate that a full 93 percent of the growth in concentration across national industries comes from large firms serving more localities.</p><p>Choice on the ground then is improving, and big tech is part of that story too. Facebook and Google are giving businesses a new outlet for their adverts, and in turn taking more national advertising market share themselves. But their entry is meaningful competition to local adverts on billboards, TV, and in newspapers. Amazon is providing huge efficiencies in retail too, competing with a range of local stores, and facilitating broader competition through hosting third-party sellers.</p><p>Yes, national concentration has risen. And, yes, many markups have too. But it's the adoption of new technologies lowering top firms' costs of expansion that explains these trends, not underenforced antitrust, or firms raising prices.</p><p>If correct, this new evidence suggests we don't need to give more power to regulators, nor do we need a revival of some broader antitrust. What we need, as Google's chief economist Hal Varian has intimated, is time to allow these technologies to diffuse through the economy. It takes time for entry in relation to higher markups and for new technologies to become cost effective for other firms to adopt them. When they do, these technological changes will result in widespread efficiencies, and lower prices still.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123264371</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XB3-MW41-JCBF-S07J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1000\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 21, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It is 4:01 in the East.</p><p>Let's begin with some infighting here among Democrats. A Democratic source calls it the hardest Nancy Pelosi has had to work in his speakership. House Democrats emerging from a tense late night meeting about an emergency border funding measure, with Speaker Pelosi agreeing to review specific changes. Why? Democrats in the Progressive and Hispanic Caucuses argue the $4.6 billion proposal does not go far enough addressing humanitarian needs.</p><p>Pelosi called the meeting following reports of poor conditions at border protection centers, and President Trump's threat of mass deportations, the speaker addressed the border issue before the meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Families belong together in America. Everyone has rights. Immigrants have rights and we just have to beat that drum for the next couple of weeks. And as we do so, we must also pass legislation that meets the humanitarian needs at the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: The clock is ticking on several fronts. A vote on the Democratic proposal remains set for today. Lawmakers leave Washington for a week-long recess on Thursday and the president pushed back his time line, but said the deportations across the country will move ahead in 12 days. The chair of the House Democratic Caucus recently outlined leadership's border strategy.</p><p>Without some version of emergency immigration funding, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar says that the effect on HHS would be, quote, like a government shutdown.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Help is coming immediately for nearly 250 migrant children held at a Customs and Border Protections Agency in Clint, Texas. The Department of Health and Human Services will be shifted into its shelter system by today. This comes days after CNN reported on a team of lawyers, doctors and advocates warning of what they called major health and hygiene problems at that Clint facility.</p><p>Our Jake Tapper asked Vice President Mike Pence about those conditions on Sunday. Pence quickly pivoted to politics.</p><p>As of June 10th, more than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been transferred from DHS to HHS, a 60 percent increase over last year.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. We are counting down to the first Democratic debate. Round one is tomorrow night. It features Elizabeth Warren and Beto O'Rourke center stage. O'Rourke just announced a new proposal for a war tax. He wants non-military households to help cover the costs of health care for veterans of new wars.</p><p>Round two is Thursday night, featuring Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders on the stage. Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris will also be headlining. These first two debates offer the lower tiered candidates a chance to break out of the pack. Most of them have kept a light campaign schedule over the past few days to prepare for what could be their make or break moment. That preparation ranges from mock debates to reading up on policy differences.</p><p>ROMANS: A lot of pictures on that screen.</p><p>All right. President Trump doesn't think he needs congressional approval for a military strike against Iran.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I like the idea of keeping Congress abreast but I wouldn't want to have to do that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nancy Pelosi actually said you must have congressional approval. So, you disagree with her on that?</p><p>TRUMP: I disagree.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Members of Congress have debated the question of the president's authority, especially in the wake of the attack the president called off last week. He ordered that strike in retaliation for Iran's downing of an unmanned American spy plane.</p><p>Senate Democrats weighing whether to block the annual defense policy bill. The idea would be to force a vote on an amendment requiring congressional approval for any war with Iran.</p><p>[04:05:01] BRIGGS: Meantime, the president targeted Iran's supreme leader with new sanctions Monday, warning that U.S. restraint is limited. Overnight, the Iranian foreign ministry slapped back, saying the new sanctions mean the White House is, quote, closing the channel of diplomacy forever.</p><p>CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is standing by live in Tehran.</p><p>Fred, what's the latest there?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Dave. Well, the Iranians today are essentially trying to laugh off these new sanctions by the U.S. against part of Iranian senior leadership, while at the same time, as you said, they're also saying they close off any sort of chance for diplomacy between the two nations. You know, around this time is always a big time for news lines, for things to happen, for people to say things. Here in Iran, that's exactly what's happening right now.</p><p>So, I do have breaking news for you guys, because Iran's President Hassan Rouhani just came out and he gave a speech and press conference here in Tehran, where he once again said these tariffs are not going to have any sort of effect on the supreme leader. He says supreme leader has no assets around the world, saying he's not like other leaders. He also called the sanctions abnormal and said he believes the White House and the U.S. is in a state of confusion right now.</p><p>He said, this is a quote, actually: The Pentagon is confused, CentCom is confused, the White House is confused as well. Among this confusion, they have begun to take illogical moves and lie.</p><p>Now, all of this comes, guys, as the Iranians are trying to downplay this. If you look at the Iranian media, which we have been all day today, the items of the supreme leader getting sanctioned are pretty low down in the newscast, really down in newspapers as well. And the same time, you do have the spokesman for the foreign ministry coming out and saying the fact that the supreme leader is being sanctioned, and that later in the week, the U.S. says it will also sanction the top diplomat, the foreign minister makes diplomacy between these two nations all but impossible.</p><p>And then just a couple of minutes ago an advisor to Hassan Rouhani, the president, came out and said because the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, is getting sanctioned by the United States, he is making more and more a Nelson Mandela of Iran, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Quite an analogy there. These sanctions look largely symbolic, seems to be the sense of it over there as well.</p><p>Fred Pleitgen, live for us in Tehran -- thank you, sir.</p><p>A warning that some commonly prescribed drugs are tied to a 5 percent higher risk of dementia in older people. A new study published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine suggests the link is strongest for certain types of antidepressants, antipsychotics and epilepsy drugs. The researchers say the increased risk is associated with an adult taking a strong dose of one of these drugs daily for at least three years. It's unclear whether the drugs caused the dementia, or if something else is at work. The researchers say it's important not to stop taking the drugs without consulting your doctor.</p><p>ROMANS: Certainly a study getting a lot of attention this morning.</p><p>All right. Authorities in the Bahamas say five people were injured when a Carnival Cruise tour excursion bus was involved in a rollover accident. Four of them suffered injuries, two severe to be treated in the Bahamas. They were airlifted by a U.S. military plane to a hospital in Ft. Lauderdale.</p><p>There were 32 people on that tour bus. They were part of a Carnival ecstasy five-day cruise that departed Jacksonville three days ago. The cause of the accident under investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: Bill Gates is calling on the United States government to step up its regulation of big tech. The founder of Microsoft says companies like the one he created have so much influence on culture, business, life that they must be constantly monitored.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GATES: Well, technology's become so central that government has to think, OK, what does that mean about elections? What does it mean about bullying? Things like privacy, I'm sure they will, and there should be at this point, better regulation that relates to that. The fact that now this is the way people consume media has really brought an end to a realm that, you know, we need to shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: Gates' remarks coming on the same day Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that could force companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook to reveal how much they make off of your data. The bill would compels commercial data operators with more than 100 million users to provide public updates.</p><p>All signs point to regulating big tech. They think they will continue down that line.</p><p>ROMANS: Well, yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: The money coming in from --</p><p>ROMANS: One of the big concerns is that, frankly, Washington Congress doesn't have the expertise to be able to regulate big tech well, but big tech lost the ability for self-regulations. They had right there in their hands and the quest for profit and the -- you know, privacy concerns --</p><p>BRIGGS: They'll pump a lot of money, though, into this 2020 cycle. You'll wonder if that will pump the brakes a bit.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Ten minutes past the hour.</p><p>[04:10:01] A missing student mystery in Utah. A 23-year-old is dropped off at a park and hasn't been seen from since.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. More now on that remarkable attack from the president against the Federal Reserve. The president bashing the fed for bashing them on not helping a strong economy and yet in the same breath, the president taking credit for a strong economy.</p><p>President Trump said the central bank is acting like a, quote, stubborn child for refusing to pursues even easier money policies.</p><p>[04:15:06] You'll recall last week, the Fed kept interest rates steady but hinted it could lower interest rates, partly because of rising tensions over the president's trade war with China. The Fed on alert but stocks are near record highs and the president, again, with no evidence claimed that stocks would be even higher, a lot higher were it not for the Fed.</p><p>The president is right now, that June has been great for investors. You could argue it would be better if not for his trade war, not the Fed, by his own trade policy. The Dow was up more than 8 percent, S&amp;P 500 more than 7 percent. Look at the Nasdaq in June, a very strong month on Wall Street. The Nasdaq up 9 percent.</p><p>Unemployment also is at the lowest level in half a century, but Trump still wants lowest rates. And after last week's meeting, Goldman Sachs said the Fed delivered a clear rate cut signal adding the central bank would have to drop the rates next month because of its fear of disappointing the market, and the economists have back Jerome Powell's wait and see approach to interest rates in order to keep inflation and employment levels near their targets.</p><p>BRIGGS: Police in Salt Lake City say University of Utah student missing for more than a week was last seen at a park before she vanished. Twenty-three-year-old Mackenzie Lueck arrived at the Salt Lake City International Airport in the early morning hours last Monday after visiting family members in California. She then took a Lyft ride to a park in north South Lake, miles from where she lived and has not been seen since.</p><p>Lyft and the driver are cooperating with police. The driver confirmed the route she took, telling police Mackenzie met someone after being dropped off.</p><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers plan to extend the protective netting past the far ends of each dugout at Dodgers Stadium. It comes after a fan was hit in the head by a foul ball Sunday.</p><p>Kaitlyn Salazar spoke about the incident.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAITLYN SALAZAR, HIT BY FOUL BALL: You know those movies where a bomb goes off and you hear an eerie sound and then like the scene starts to get fady and then everyone sounds like mumble? Yes, like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: There has been greater scrutiny on fan safety after a woman died last year when she was hit by a line drive foul ball at Dodgers Stadium. Just last month, a 4-year-old was struck by a line drive during a game in Houston. The Washington Nationals will also make the changes with the netting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The host is Milan and Cortina.</p><p>(CHEERS)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: The Italian delegation erupting in cheers after the International Olympic Committee announced the 2026 Winter Games would be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.</p><p>The IOC selecting Milan and Cortina over the other finalist, Stockholm. Italy has hosted the Winter Olympics twice before. Cortina in 1956 and Turin in 2006, but this will be the first time for the city of Milan.</p><p>BRIGGS: The U.S. women's national team is onto the quarterfinals to the 2019 women's World Cup. They defeated Spain Monday but barely, 2- 1 behind two Megan Rapinoe penalty kicks, one on a controversial call. Team USA, the defending World Cup champs, will now meet France, the host nation on Friday. U.S. and France are considered by many to be the top two teams in the tournament.</p><p>ROAMSN: All right. Shipping companies connect the world. So, what should they do when goods are banned from another? FedEx is now suing to make the point.</p><p>ROMANS: FedEx sits at the global intersection between commerce and trade, and now, the shipping giant is suing the U.S. Commerce Department pushing back against new restrictions aimed at the embattled Chinese tech firm Huawei.</p><p>CNN business reporter Sherisse Pham joins us now live from Hong Kong.</p><p>And this is just a remarkable fight that FedEx finds itself right in the middle of between the Commerce Department trying to basically black list Huawei and the company concerned to be more law enforcement than package delivery company?</p><p>SHERISSE PHAM, CNN MONEY REPORTER: You're absolutely right, Christine. This lawsuit against the Commerce Department comes as FedEx is under fire in China for mishandling a couple of deliveries to Huawei and essentially watching another one involving a Huawei smartphone. So, FedEx is saying, looks, we cannot be the police. We can't enforce these U.S. restrictions that have been placed on Huawei and other companies.</p><p>Of course, the Trump administration added Huawei to a trade blast list last month, essentially barring U.S. companies from selling and supply tech and components to the Chinese companies and this has left a lot of American and global companies scrambling to figure out what they can and cannot sell to Huawei. FedEx is just the latest company to be caught in the crosshairs.</p><p>And FedEx CEO Craig Smith gave an interview to Fox News saying, look, we don't have the wherewithal and the capacity to enforce these U.S. trade restrictions.</p><p>[04:25:05] Have a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VDIEO CLIP)</p><p>CRAIG SMITH, FEDEX CEO: The increasing use of restrictions on exports and imports by the Commerce Department in various geopolitical and trade disputes creates just an impossible burden. We are expected to be policemen for these export-and-import controls.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PHAM: The FedEx CEO there essentially calling out the Trump administration for using these Commerce Department restrictions against Huawei. The Commerce Department saying we have not reviewed the FedEx lawsuit but we look forward to defending the Commerce Department's position in protecting national security, Christine.</p><p>ROMANS: But, certainly, politically inside China, there's been such a backlash against FedEx. For FedEx to come out against the Commerce Department might play well in mainland China.</p><p>PHAM: Absolutely. And that is definitely -- you have to think that is factoring into FedEx's decision here. And this is a huge moment, too, because investors look at that as a bellwether for global and economic activity. And FedEx is saying, look, this is a burden on our company.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Sherisse, thank you so much for that. Nice to see you this morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right. Coming up, billions of emergency funding at the border on the line, but the liberal wing of House Democrats wants more to address humanitarian needs. Could infighting sink the plan before lawmakers go on recess?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019062501CNV34</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-70G1-DXH2-60MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>E.

His wife's story is amazing, but you see it on his show, you see him every day. Right now, \"THE FIVE.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: Hello, everyone. I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, and this is THE FIVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After losing to President Trump in 2016 and failing to block Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation, Democrats are now looking to change the rules. Their proposals would alter the constitution and upend hundreds of years of precedent. A growing number of 2020 candidates are now revolting against the current makeup of the Supreme Court and want major changes. Much more on that in a moment.</p><p>But first, Elizabeth Warren now making the idea of abolishing the Electoral College part of her campaign.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: My view is that every vote matters. And the way we can make that happen --</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: -- is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right. So we've -- I won't say that. I've been talking about this for about a year, Jesse, that this is coming because Hillary Clinton when she lost to Donald Trump, she said we have to take a look at the Electoral College. And now it's almost become a litmus test among the Democrats that they're all saying, yeah, I think we have to take a look at this Electoral College thing. Get rid of it. Because it's the only way they think they can win in the future.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. They know they can't beat him under those rules, so they're trying to rig the system. If I were a Democrat, I would just say I can beat Trump with the rules. I don't need to change it.</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>WATTERS: I'll get past 270. I'll re-rack the map. I will rebuild the blue wall. And I think that looks much stronger than these people right now who look extremely weak. Right now I don't want the cities running this country. I mean, San Francisco is a homeless paradise. L.A. is not much better, and Chicago is like a corrupt shooting gallery. And look what New York did to Amazon. I don't think we need to give them any more power than they already have.</p><p>What they're trying to do is they're trying to disenfranchise flyover country. They're only their four time a year anyway, but they don't want to have them have any more power. And Liz Warren thinks she knows more than Ben Franklin? We designed a constitutional republic to prevent mob rule. And that's the point. And what they're trying to do is short- circuit all of these systems in place because they know they can't beat Trump.</p><p>They want to lower the voting age to 16. They want to impeach. They want to stack the court. They want to kick conservatives off television. All of these things they're doing because they know they can't win right now.</p><p>PERINO: The Founding Fathers, you know, the constitution.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yes, I read of them in high school.</p><p>PERINO: What's called the United States of America. If you go to a national popular vote, it would be the united people of America, except maybe not so united.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Talk about voter suppression, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: Yeah.</p><p>GUTFELD: Liz Warren, she's either cheating to get into college or cheating to get out of college. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This is a contest among the candidates of who can go further. Let's get rid of the Electoral College. Oh, yeah. Let's make the Supreme Court have term limits.</p><p>Oh, yeah. Let's have an Electoral College replaced with a poetry slam contest and the losing side has to give all their salaries to reparations. They're doing this, to your point, because it's hard to challenge Trump on his record right now because the economy is booming.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: What's your alternative to that? Not booming? I mean, that's -- what do you got? What's interesting -- some of these guys and girls, coming up with these so-called revolutionary ideas, they're just throwing stuff up there to see what sticks. Oddly enough, they've got to admit, Trump has -- is more likely to come up with new ideas that have challenge the Republican orthodoxy, and the parties orthodoxy, and any ideology's orthodoxy.</p><p>When you think about North Korea, trade, prison reform, and Syria, the Democrats have been chasing collusion for two years. That's why they're devoid of any kind of strategy because they've been so lazy. They're just hoping for impeachment and they've got nothing. They should try to challenge him on ideas. That would be interesting. The problem is his ideas are sometimes similar to theirs.</p><p>PERINO: Right. And also, what do you make of that, Juan -- like Jesse's point of -- if you're a Democrat and you're running -- the Electoral College is not going to change for the 2020 election. Maybe they want to do it in the future, but it's not going to change. So, somebody --if on the Democratic side should say I can win in the current system.</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think people acknowledge that, Dana. I don't think anybody is saying they want to change for 2020, right?</p><p>PERINO: No, I'm just saying why waste all this energy --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, no, because it's a good idea. Because I think --</p><p>PERINO: Why?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I mean, for example, when you vote for a governor, you vote one man, one vote. And in the current Electoral College system, it's not one man, one vote --</p><p>PERINO: But that's --</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- a vote coming from Wyoming is worth more than a vote coming from California. That's not fair on the face of it.</p><p>PERINO: That's not true in the House. That's why it's proportional in the House.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. We're not talking about the House. We're talking about the presidency. The vote for the presidency -- the Electoral College applies only to the presidency.</p><p>PERINO: I know.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So it doesn't matter. What I'm saying to you is this is not about Democrats being sore losers. This is about Democrats coming up with ideas in keeping with the Founding Fathers. The Founding Fathers engaged - -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, it's exactly wrong. The Founding Fathers created a constitution that is able to evolve with a changing nation. And so what you get is things like doing away with the 3/5 compromise, Jesse, saying, hey, you know what, we made a mistake about this. We did it in order to establish the country because we needed the slave states, but we know it's wrong and so we undid it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: But you think -- constitutional amended for abolishing the college?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hang on. Let me finish once.</p><p>WATTERS: Go ahead.</p><p>WILLIAMS: How about women voting? The constitution didn't allow it when it was created. But guess what? It does now. So when you put forward ideas like this, it's healthy. It says Jesse and Juan should have a debate. We could argue it. Nobody is saying we're going to break the rules. We're saying let's put forward ideas that, in fact, might be more representative of the country we are today.</p><p>WATTERS: And they can have a debate and then they can amend the constitution, but you know that's not going to happen.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Of course that's what they're proposing.</p><p>WATTERS: That's never going to happen, Juan.</p><p>PERINO: So Elizabeth Warren made this comment in Mississippi, right? It's a small state. So there are more voters in San Diego County than there are in all of Mississippi. So if you're a candidate and you actually -- it's a race to get to the popular vote rather than the Electoral College, why would you go campaign in a small state?</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: Exactly. And that's why if you like the arguments are antithetical to the whole approach anyway. Because no matter what, the counter is that the same thing is going to happen. It's just -- you're going to continue to ignore the flyover country which is exactly why President Trump was elected because people felt ignored on policy.</p><p>And so now they're going to be ignored for thwarting the vote. I think -- and also, I think, it goes against even the arguments for the citizenship question, for example. If vote delusion is the basis on which all of these arguments lay, then there's a hypocrisy on so many levels. And that's how, to me, it gets interpreted poorly in that way.</p><p>And I think it also wastes everyone's time. If there's that national popular vote interstate compact none of it is every going to get anywhere. And yet this is just rhetoric that's wasting everyone's time trying to get there when 270 is not going to be achieved for those states.</p><p>PERINO: There was one other topic we wanted to get to because the Electoral College is one thing the Democrats are talking about, but also 2020 candidates are calling for a major shake-up of the Supreme Court. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What if there were five justices selected by Democrats, five justices selected by Republicans, and those ten didn't pick five more justices independent to those who choose the first ten.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One idea that I think is interesting is you have 15 members but only ten of them are appointed in the political fashion. Five of them can only be seated by unanimous agreement of the other ten.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think they stole a Supreme Court seat.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can we keep it in nine? Should we keep it nine?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I think I would like to start exploring a lot of option and we should have a national conversation. Term limits for Supreme Court justices might be one thing, to give every president the ability to choose three. People holding on those seats in ways that I don't think is necessarily healthy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: President Trump responding to those ideas earlier.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I wouldn't entertain that. The only reason is that they're doing that is that they want to try to catch up. So if they can't catch up through the ballot box by winning an election, they want to try doing it in a different way. Now, we won't have no interest in that whatsoever. It'll never happen. It won't happen. I guarantee you it won't happen for six years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right, no court packing.</p><p>GUTFELD: Well, I mean, is it a coincidence they lose because the Electoral College, they want to change that. And now there's an edge for the Republicans in the Supreme Court, so they want to change that. That's just purely a coincidence. They've got to remember, you change the rules, you change the rules for everybody. Ask Harry Reid how that worked out for his own party. It's very shortsighted to decide when you lose that you're going to change the rules, because if the other side is smarter than you, they'll just catch up. They'll figure it out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That sounds like an argument against the national emergency. I'm glad you brought it up. But I think the bigger problem -- the bigger problem here is the Republicans broke the rules in terms of denying Merrick Garland a Supreme Court seat a year into a properly elected, twice elected president, Barack Obama. They said, no, we're not going to let you appoint --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: You know what I would do, Juan? Instead, I would try adding seats in the Senate instead of adding seats to the Supreme Court.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, my God, this guy on my show today wants to abolish the Senate, too.</p><p>WATTERS: I mean, where do you go from there? Where do you go from there? But you know what? The conservatives in the exit polls, Juan, they've said the most important issue in 2016 when they're coming out if the vote was the Supreme Court. And if the Democrats are going to run on messing around with the Supreme Court, that is going to activate conservatives so much in 2020 you're not going to see --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think Chief Justice Roberts who is a Republican is concerned about the credibility of this court. That is seen as simply a rubber-stamp for whoever has the political majority, because it's mostly Republicans --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WATTERS: If it is so much of a rubber-stamp, Juan, why do you want then to water it down? Because if you guys -- if you take the Senate and you take the White House, that means there's going to be a watered-down Supreme Court that's basically going to rubber-stamp socialism.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You're missing the point which is restore the credit -- so that you and I could trust that it's not just a political institution.</p><p>WATTERS: Who attacks the integrity of the court more?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WATTERS: Republicans or Democrats?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>PERINO: But if Hillary Clinton -- Emily, if Hillary Clinton had won and she had put two Supreme Court justices on, I don't think that the Democrats would say that the credibility of the court was in question.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Of course not. We wouldn't have candidates saying they have a confidence crisis which is what Kamala Harris has said in SCOTUS. I think this is absolutely ridiculous. And I think -- you know, we saw this in the 30s. This is what Roosevelt went through. It was a complete waste of taxpayer dollars and it fractured the party and it didn't work because it - - for 80 years, the justices -- seats were messed around with in the 1800's and then it ended.</p><p>Term limits which candidates are also throwing around needs a constitutional amendment to achieve that. That's in the constitution. These judges serve for good behavior. They can be impeached and that's it. So I also think it kind of blazon ignorance with all of them talking about it. But I personally want my lawmakers to focus on making laws and not monkeying around with the amount of seats that they're going to put on when that's not what we're here to do at all.</p><p>And that's not going to change anything. And in terms -- if there is some type of crisis in confidence, then to me that rhetoric is just stirring the pot anyway. For example, a cover today said if they invented -- those court invented the individual right to bear arms, the court didn't invent that. That's in the constitution, so --</p><p>PERINO: All right. Well, obviously, we've got lots of issues to talk about with 2020 --</p><p>GUTFELD: Abolish the Senate, replace with puppies.</p><p>PERINO: Not a bad idea. Not a bad idea. I'm still going to stick up for Wyoming and say keep the Senate. All right, what a veteran news anchor is saying about the media's coverage of President Trump. See that next.</p><p>COMPAGNO: It's no secret that President Trump can't stand what he calls fake news. Now the president is getting a big boost from legendary news anchor Ted Koppel about biased media coverage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TED KOPPEL, BROADCAST JOURNALIST: I'm terribly concerned that when you talk about the New York Times these days, when you talk about the Washington Post these days, we're not talking about the New York Times of 50 years ago. We're not talking about the Washington Post of 50 years ago. We're talking about organizations that I believe have, in fact, decided as organizations that Donald J. Trump is bad for the United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right, Juan, would you be willing to acknowledge that as Koppel says that the mainstream media has dropped all pretense of neutrality in their coverage of the president?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. In fact -- I mean, I worked for the Washington Post, you know. I mean, it's a legendary organization that did the most amazing investigative reporting in history in terms of Watergate. Look at the New York Times' Pentagon papers. Dana Perino is sitting at this table. I bet if you ask her, was the Washington Post tough on George W. Bush? She'll say yeah --</p><p>PERINO: Yeah.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. So, I mean --</p><p>PERINO: Still mad about it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Right. So what you have is news organizations are supposed to be adversarial to people in power.</p><p>WATTERS: Except they weren't during the Obama years.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Of course they were.</p><p>WATTERS: No, they weren't.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You go asked the Obama people, they'll tell you.</p><p>WATTERS: They didn't give him enough love?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. And I'm going to tell you something else. They have lots of complaints about Fox News than me. So, I mean, I don't get it. The complaints go across the board. But I will say this, covering Donald Trump is so different. If you consider that you wake up and Kellyanne Conway's husband is saying that the president has mental issues. Man, if Ronald Reagan -- if somebody was doing that about Ronald Reagan when I was covering the White House, we would have been on that story for weeks. This hardly gets covered today.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Quick follow up, though, Ted Koppel made that point. He said, you know, this is -- unrelated great journalism versus they're not neutral whatsoever. That there is a bias on every front page and that's true -- to un-related because --</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's so different covering this president. He is unique. I think everybody can agree he is different. The way he uses twitter. The way he goes after people. The way he bullies people. It's -- the way that he has transformed the Republican Party, the way that he uses media as an echo chamber. It's just different. And if you're a newspaper reporter, you better get -- Bob Woodward, widely respected. What did Woodward say? He pushes the fear button at every opportunity.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Wait, can I just respond?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Sure.</p><p>GUTFELD: There're two things going on right now. OK, yes, the consensus media is after Trump, but they -- I remember, I'm young enough -- I'm old enough to remember how Ronald Reagan was treated and how George -- they were demonized too. But this is different because it's no longer right versus left. It's the resistance versus anyone else. They have demonized.</p><p>They've expanded the target of demonization so it's not just Trump. It's a voter, all right? It's people who don't join the resistance. They have damned an entire population because that is the profit model right now. CNN, the Washington Post, social platforms see division as a way to make money and they -- by the way, CNN, this is their second go around. They did this with law enforcement for five or six years. Now they're doing the Trump voter, right?</p><p>This is a way to make money. The consensus media has decided to demonize half the population. It's unhealthy. So, yeah, you're right. They've always been liberally biased. They hated Reagan. They hated Bush. They hated Nixon, right? But this is different because now they hate everybody associated with them. That's the danger.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, Trump has -- President Trump has this rhetoric, right? It's the enemy of the people, et cetera. But the Obama administration employed a lot more, one could argue, actions that stymied the free press, right? They were the ones that banned Fox News from a lot of different things and a lot of important conference calls and whatnot --</p><p>PERINO: Yeah, they've tried.</p><p>COMPAGNO: -- literally persecuted journalist. So how do you feel like that's even reconciled in this larger conversation?</p><p>PERINO: Well, it's not, right? If you look back to Bernie Goldberg who in 2004, I think, maybe it was earlier than that, he was a veteran CBS reporter. He wrote a best-selling book called Biased. And it was his realization over time that, you know, there was a bias against conservatives. But the thing I always feel like -- that's why conservatives -- you just have to work harder and be smarter and utilize new technologies, like President Trump does.</p><p>I really think that when the history books are written -- stay with me here, folks. I'm going to praise twitter and the president's tweets. Looking back, so what happen? We had the printing press. That was a huge technological development for how you disseminate information. Then you get to the radio and then you have fireside chats and people say what is he doing on the radio? He should be focused on -- but you know what? That was the best thing that he could have done.</p><p>Ronald Reagan uses television to his advantage. Now you have President Obama who actually zoomed past Hillary Clinton because he understood social media better than she did. And now President Trump has figured out a way to talk directly to the American people. The thing is he's not the only one that has the tools and access to it. Before, if you are Reagan, you could do the TV stuff -- not everybody could have a radio show. Now everyone has a voice.</p><p>One thing I would point out about the media coverage, Facebook has tried to do this thing where they are trying to find local newspapers and news organizations that they can give money to, that they can support because local news is dying. Well, guess what? They're so dead they can't find anyone to help. It's all gone. You have to like -- almost recreate it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Jesse, do you feel like the rise in opinion journalism is actually a good thing? And so, readers can figure out -- and viewers can figure out for themselves which is more persuasive?</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah, I think the viewers are smart and that's why CNN is dead last in the ratings. But Brokaw said it himself, and this is a direct quote, Juan. He said, we're at war, quote, with Donald Trump. Bill Maher said he's rooting for a recession because he wants Trump out of the White House. Greg's right, it's a profit motive. These people are crusading against the president. They want to protect the country against Donald Trump, and they're making a fortune doing it.</p><p>Bezos owns the Washington Post. Carlos Slim owns the Times. They hate this president. And they have reporters up Trump's you know what 24/7. The two cable companies, Phil Griffin, Jeff Zucker, the president, hate this president. And they're going on a 24-hour news cycle against him. If you look at the networks, 93 percent negative coverage against this president.</p><p>The social media networks all donating to Democrats' de-flat-forming conservatives. If you objectively look at this president, he has the same exact approval rating as Obama did at the same time --</p><p>WILLIAMS: No.</p><p>WATTERS: -- 90 percent approval rating among Republicans. We're at 3 percent growth now with the economy. We have peace and prosperity. Historic upset against Hillary, and probably on the way to winning a second term. Yet, the media calls this guy a lying mentally ill racist who needs to be imprisoned or impeached. It is so unfair and disgusting what is happening right now. He has every right to say that fake news is the enemy of the American people.</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right. President Trump weighs in also on Devin Nunes' massive lawsuit against twitter, hear from him next.</p><p>WATTERS: Devin Nunes is blasting twitter in a whopping $250 million lawsuit. He's accusing the tech giant of massive bias, censoring conservatives, and unfairly targeting him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DEVIN NUNES (R), CALIFORNIA: This was an orchestrated effort. So people were targeting me. There were anonymous accounts that were developed. And look, they're not supposed to be -- these accounts aren't supposed to exist. How is it that every day there's conservatives that are being banned? They should come clean. Give us all your algorithms. This is more than just conservatives. Every American should care about this if they care about the first amendment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: OK. Emily, Judge Napolitano on our air says that -- oh, actually President Trump, before we react to that, also talked about the big tech bias. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We have to do something. Things are happening. Names are taken off. People aren't getting through. You've heard the same complaints. And it seems to be, if they're conservative, if they're Republicans, if they're in a certain group, there's discrimination and big discrimination. I see it absolutely on twitter. And Facebook which I have also and others I see, but I really focus more on the one platform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: All right. So, as I was saying, Judge Napolitano said on our air that it's not illegal for twitter to, you know, shadow ban people or take action because it's a private entity. Do you agree?</p><p>COMPAGNO: I definitely agree. And what's tricky too is that courts have held two things that helped twitter in this regard, primarily that they can do what they want. They can ban people. They can demote users, whatever. And then secondly, that they aren't responsible for the content that they post. And there was a case upheld through the United States Supreme Court that basically yelp, didn't have to take down a defamatory post, right?</p><p>And I want to point out the fact that we have lawmakers that are arguing about things when we have in the communications decency act, that's what set out that these platforms are not responsible for the content unless they put something novel on it, right? And I know there's an argument in the courts whether that novelty has to do with add (ph) as well, whatever.</p><p>But - so it would be up to lawmakers to change the laws if they wanted, because right now the courts are favoring the platforms. That being said, these tech companies are on the hot seat in Congress, obviously, and so it would probably behoove them to have a warmer relationship between the two.</p><p>Twitter is tricky too and that it sets its own rules. And so it can say, \"Oh, we didn't need to shadow ban you. And we didn't shadow ban, because it was an exception and it was this algorithm or whatever, and so they can always kind of get out of it in a court setting, which they do.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. But it's not just Twitter, Juan, who makes \"Mistakes\" and bans people, Facebook had to apologize because they shadow banned Trump's own Social Media Director, Dan Scavino. It just seems like a lot of mistakes that the social media platforms are making always end up damaging conservatives.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I don't think they were shadow ban. From what I understand, they thought he was a bot.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, they knock him out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, that wasn't a matter of any kind of - look, they just thought this guy is repeating something in such a fashion that we don't think he's a real person, so you can understand that.</p><p>I think the larger point here is that this is a nuisance lawsuit. I mean, I think he just wants attention. He's a guy who said President Obama was somehow wiretapping down - there's no truth to it.</p><p>But he now says they're making fun of. Were they making fun of his mom or something like that, and he didn't like it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: It's a parody account. She it took her--</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, leave moms out of it.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. But I think that Emily is on target here. There's a - they're private company. But they are on the hot seat with regard to hate speech and a lot of the conspiracy theories that then foment violence and anger. And people have a right to say, \"Hey, why don't you regulate that? \"But I don't think this is what Devin Nunes is talking.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, just to be clear, Juan, that Obama officials were wiretapping--</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, stop. Get out of here.</p><p>WATTERS: --and that's been reported even in The New York Times.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, my gosh.</p><p>WATTERS: Dana is this a frivolous lawsuit, as Juan says, or not?</p><p>PERINO: It's kind of interesting, because for those of us who have been the target of bots - OK like Russian bots.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe if it a nuisance, may be,but also he may be at least the first to say, \"Look,I'm going to file this lawsuit\". Maybe he doesn't think it's actually going to go anywhere, but will make people think, prompt for the tech companies is that they have no natural political allies.</p><p>The Left thinks that the social media companies helped elect Donald Trump, right?They're mad at Facebook and all that. Then you have the Right things that the social media companies are only supportive of the Left. And you have the media companies who are mad, because social media is taken away ad dollars and clicks.</p><p>And so you have a situation where big tech is now like pharma and big oil and tobacco all rolled into one.</p><p>WATTERS: You know what? They need better lobbyists.</p><p>PERINO: Maybe.</p><p>WATTERS: That's probably would do the trick. All right, Greg, finish it up for.</p><p>GUTFELD: I've - I don't know where to start. Twitter benefits from the fact that it doesn't know what it is. It's writing the neither line between utility and publishing, so it can constantly move around and say, \"Well ,we're not this and we're not that\". We have to put them in a box, because it's time.</p><p>You know what you know what Twitter is?</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I'm so shocked you said that.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'll tell you what because, I - Twitter is America's bathroom wall, I've said this over and over again. When Web sites started up, OK, when The Huffington Post started up, I was there at the beginning, blogging. When Breitbart started up, I was there at the beginning. The worst part about those Web sites were the comments section. So everybody said don't read the comment section, just read the articles, the articles are fine, ignore the comment sections.</p><p>What is Twitter?</p><p>COMPAGNO: It's a comment--</p><p>GUTFELD: It's the comments section without the articles. It is why it's an engine of unhappiness, and bitterness, and loneliness. It doesn't have any substance. And the company, is like a lot of corporations, in that it's made up of cowards who are terrified of the social media mob.</p><p>The Left has mastered the weaponry of the mob. It takes three people to frighten a company and to drop their advertising, if you know what I mean. But Twitter is OK. If Christians or Pro-Lifers are pissed off, because they know advertisers don't care. But they know if the Left gets mad they're going to freak out.</p><p>So they - so the Right has to has to learn from the Left and go after the people who are bent to the mob. Go after the advertisers who bent to the mob.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I thought you were on target in saying finally, we got to put these guys in a bus, because they say they have no responsibility for the most vicious, awful things and they should be held responsible, because they spread it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: And Greg still wants you to follow him on Twitter. OK?</p><p>GUTFELD: No. You know what, you don't have to. It doesn't - you know --</p><p>PERINO: Because, it's not reality.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's not.</p><p>GUTFELD: So, I got this piece of information from a company that said when half the - I guess their staff stopped promoting their products on Twitter, no effects, right? No effects.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Zip - zilch.</p><p>GUTFELD: Why are we tweeting?</p><p>PERINO: Yes. Let's just self-de-platform.</p><p>WATTERS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: Why can't we?</p><p>WATTERS: All right. We're going to do in the commercial break. But up next the ridiculous reasons why Millennials say they are very, very stressed out.</p><p>GUTFELD: Dick Dale, RIP. All right. A new study of 2,000 Millennials finds that a third believe their lives are more stressful than the average person's. And 60 percent feel that life is more stressful than ever before.</p><p>OK. To hold those opinions, you cannot have been alive or cognizant during World Wars, terror attacks, crime waves, killer diseases, when Jimmy Carter was President, the Cuban missile crisis or when dinosaurs walked the earth.</p><p>How else can you believe that living in the most prosperous, peaceful, time in existence, the Trump era is stressful. You want stressful, look up 1942 or Don Knotts. But I think your life is more stressed - thinking your life is more stressful is simply human nature. We all find our own hangnail more urgent than a distant outbreak of malaria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: But there are worse stressors. Here are three, this guy might be President. This could be your boss. This could be you. And thank god you don't wake up to this every morning or looking like this, or laughing like this.</p><p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: (Laughter)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Now top daily stresses included a damaged phone screen and ignored social media posts. So life is good. That's not a gas crisis or stagflation. No one remembers that I'm old.But also the real stressors never changed, losing a wallet came in first, second was an argument with your partner.</p><p>So even in this new world, no matter how great your day is, it all goes to hell when who isn't speaking to you. So we have some in common with our parents, their parents and their parents. A cold shoulder still hurts more so than zero likes and hooray for that.</p><p>That made me happy, Dana that people still get upset about human interaction?</p><p>PERINO: Yes. That happened to Peter - I mean, a couple weeks ago.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: He woke up on the wrong side of the bed.</p><p>GUTFELD: I hate that.</p><p>PERINO: Had bad mood and he yelled at Jasper. Yelled like - well, like he said, he made - he told me get out of the way, like, in the bed. And I was like, \"How can you do that?\" And then he said, basically - I'm sorry Peter, I'm telling this story. But then I said - and then he started mocking me, right?</p><p>He was like, \"Oh, Jasper, why did you move across the bed?\" I was like, \"Ah\", and I didn't speak to him for four hours.</p><p>WATTERS: Wow, I thought the Conways had a problem.</p><p>GUTFELD: You know the equivalent of the Conways would be Peter going to some other network trashing Jasper.</p><p>PERINO: Like on Animal Planet.</p><p>GUTFELD: Is that animal - Jasper is the greatest, Peter's on Animal Planet going that darn steaks.</p><p>PERINO: Yes. We made up though.</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily, I guess technically you're a Millennial.</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, I'm not.</p><p>GUTFELD: What are you?</p><p>COMPAGNO: My time - I was born in the 70s.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, well, OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: You know, I'm not--</p><p>PERINO: That's why she is--</p><p>GUTFELD: You're 50 - you're going to be 50, this March?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Close to it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes. OK. Here is my issue. I feel like, of course, the #1 thing they're afraid of is disconnection, because they don't have real connections on the outside.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And also, I went to this party and there are a bunch of influencers there and I was like, \"Oh, interesting whatever\". And they were all children, none of them knew how to speak, none of them knew how to have a conversation. I was horrified.</p><p>I left early and also I had a good idea for reality show. I think we should have - it should be Millennials versus everyone else. And then you have to like navigate a city or navigate life and they can't use their devices. They have to - they have to like ask for directions. Like, \"Excuse me, sir\" or be like \"Excuse me, can you take a picture of me?\" like and see how they succeed, which they won't. They'll obviously shrivel - it's a good idea.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. It's a very good idea, Emily.</p><p>PERINO: You want to keep talking.</p><p>WATTERS: I like what she says, and also--</p><p>COMPAGNO: --there is two points.</p><p>WATTERS: It's very good.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, you are divorced from technology, so--</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm not divorced. I have two cellphones and I live on an iPad when I'm - I even read books now. It took me a long time to get used to that, because I like hard covers. But anyway --</p><p>GUTFELD: What's your daily stressor then, us?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No. But I can name it. But no. But,I think, that when young people talk about this, I think it ties into loneliness, I think it ties into a sense of being separate, jealous of other people --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: --because other people have things are on some great trip and the like, right?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, Instagram.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes. So the alienation to me is a big factor.And I see it, by the way, in suicide numbers among young people that it's an often cited as because they were being bullied, and guess what, it's coming through that kind of media.</p><p>But to me they're - we're living through changing times, and they're the tip of the spear in terms of having been influenced and growing up with this. Everything from pornography to music is different for these people.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. And we've said this before, technology is way ahead of humanity, we're catching up. Jesse, are the stressors? Was engine light goes on in car I was so happy that they know what a car was or engine light.</p><p>WATTERS: That is stressful. It happened to me the other day. It was not a pretty picture. Greg, a 100 years ago they didn't have a word for stress. It was just called life. You woke up, you went to work, you went to war. You came home, you had a drink and you went to bed. That was it.</p><p>I mean, last century there was a draft. People had their heads cracked open protesting civil rights. They literally had kids dying because they didn't have the right medicine. And now kids are upset because they're got not getting \"likes\"?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: I was reading the New York Times Magazine the other and there's a great quote I'd like to share, because I blame the parents for these Millennials.</p><p>PERINO: OK.</p><p>WATTERS: It says,\" Parents should prepare their kid for the road, not the road for the kid\".</p><p>COMPAGNO: Beautiful.</p><p>WATTERS: And that's because you've modeled these kids so they're never uncomfortable and whenever they face adversity, they melt down. That's why my parents sent me to these outdoor wilderness survival schools to make me so uncomfortable--</p><p>GUTFELD: They were trying to kill you --</p><p>WATTERS: Just wanted me to suffer. I think that's what it was.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, you told me you hated it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: You did those?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, every summer.</p><p>PERINO: He did those. And he also - like, I love this story, like, when - with the - when you got blisters on your feet--</p><p>WATTERS: On my face Dana. I had zinc oxide all over my face because my face peeled off.</p><p>COMPAGNO: From the sun?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, from the sun.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now, what is he asking?</p><p>COMPAGNO: No, I didn't know.</p><p>PERINO: So it's just a sun burn.</p><p>GUTFELD: --just hearing more about what happened to Jesse. We all take pleasure in your suffering.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. No. You should come over for Thanksgiving.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. Up next, the one thing that makes many of us furious when flying.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Welcome back. If you fly often and we on THE FIVE, we're flying all the time, then you probably can't stand it when the person in front of you puts their seat back. One writer has had enough and she's calling out those passengers.</p><p>Here's the quote, \"Reclining is perfectly acceptable on flights longer than say four or five hours, especially if it's an overnighter. But if you're reclining your seat on a two-hour midday puddle jump, I hope you miss your connection and get stuck at LaGuardia Airport without even an $8 coffee to comfort\". Jesse do you agree?</p><p>WATTERS: I do. I'm more sensitive than I appear on television.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Is that right?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, because I'm tall and I don't like when people recline into my lap. So when I recline, and I don't do it often, I'm very compassionate about the person behind me, because I'm a compassionate conservative. And so, I will like - I will only recline it halfway. I'll almost apologize as reclining it, because I feel bad for people.</p><p>WILLIAMS: So Dana, there there's an innovation called a blocker. That you can buy this blocker and stick it in --</p><p>PERINO: Better not that do that to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Don't do it to you?</p><p>PERINO: Better not do that to me.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why is that Dana?</p><p>PERINO: Because - OK, when you're really short, one of the things that happens with the seat design is that the back of the seat pushes your head forward so you have to sit like this, which is why you need to recline about an inch or so on a two hour puddle jumper, because it's so uncomfortable. And I paid for a seat too.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: And it comes with the ability to recline it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now they have, Greg, something called preclined (ph) seats on some planes.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, ridiculous!</p><p>GUTFELD: What a bunch -- OK, air travel is safer every year but it's becoming gloomier--</p><p>PERINO: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: --because of whiny little jerks. They don't fly enough. That's your problem. Oh, I can't believe. Oh, they reclining. Your seat can recline too. So when I recline, you recline.</p><p>PERINO: You recline, exactly.</p><p>GUTFELD: But you know what, what's getting me really angry is the boarding process and the TSA's inconsistent guidelines. Ninety-nine percent of TSA is great. I love those guys. But if there's that one person that abuses their power and it sickens me. You know you have to move the bins.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: The bins are coming, you stack the bins. I'm seeing they're stacking the bins, stacking the bins, stacking the bins, I get my stuff. I go. As I walk away, this lady goes,\" Excuse me. You have to stack that bin\". And then I go, \"I've just stack bins there for like 5 damn minutes. I'm doing your job.</p><p>So I have a question for the TSA. One of your people is abusing their power, what if we say no? What can be done? I want to know. Because - she demanded that I come back over there and put a bin bag--</p><p>WATTERS: And you listened to her, didn't you?</p><p>GUTFELD: Because, I didn't know. But what would happen - I want to know what would happen.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You don't want to get hooked up and delayed.</p><p>GUTFELD: You want somebody should do - somebody should say, just don't abuse your power.</p><p>WILLIAMS: And you know what - hey, they would call the cops, that's what happens.</p><p>GUTFELD: We are not moving a bin!</p><p>WATTERS: You are on a watchlist.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think somebody is having a moment. But I don't like it when people put their seat back in front of me, because I - then I'm cramped. Especially, if I'm eating something suddenly they're - like, right in my food.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Look, it is a feature on the plane.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And therefore, I will avail myself of that feature. I totally recline. And especially being small - my legs barely touch the ground, so it's so - like I have to lean back, whatever. I think, if someone behind me is pushing back, I would - that would not be OK.</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>COMPAGNO: And if there is some movement to change it, then change the plane dynamics. And also I feel like that - the girl that wrote that, she's obviously a Millennial. She's complaining about that and citing an $8 coffee? My coffee is $1.35.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But I'm going to tell you. It's not just Millennials. I think people have started fist fights over this on airplanes. All right, \"One More Thing\" up next.</p><p>PERINO: Time now for \"One More Thing\" Today, March Madness starts and it's also National Let's Laugh Day, so here is this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>\"Dana's Corny Jokes\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: That's right. \"Dana's Corny Jokes\".</p><p>GUTFELD: I thought it said it's Let's Laugh Day.</p><p>PERINO: Ha, ha, ha, get ready. All right. What did the March say to all madness?</p><p>COMPAGNO: What?</p><p>PERINO: What do the - you're supposed to answer.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Answer the question.</p><p>PERINO: What did the March say to all the madness?</p><p>WATTERS: I don't know.</p><p>GUTFELD: What's all that bracket?</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's a good one.</p><p>PERINO: Where do basketball players get their uniforms?</p><p>COMPAGNO: That's big and tall.</p><p>PERINO: New Jersey.</p><p>WATTERS: New Jersey.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Hey, let it go.</p><p>PERINO: What does a hunter do with the basketball?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Shoot it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Puts it towards the (inaudible).</p><p>PERINO: OK. Where do basketball players get their coffee?</p><p>GUTFELD: Dunkin' Donuts!</p><p>PERINO: Yes. And the last one, what does a basketball player do when he loses his eyesight?</p><p>COMPAGNO: --it's something.</p><p>PERINO: Becomes a referee! All right, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. You guys remember \"The Flintstones\" if you are as old as I am.</p><p>WATTERS: Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FRED FLINTSTONE: Yabba Dabba Doo!</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: As you know, Fred lived in Bedrock in a stone cartoon house, well, a real-life version of \"The Flintstones\" cave dwelling was built in the 70s.</p><p>GUTFELD: I used to go.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Two years ago Florence Fang, once the owner of \"The San Francisco Examiner\" bought the house. The site now includes the statues of dinosaurs, as well as recreations of Fred and Wilma. There's also a big Yabba Dabba Doo! sign.</p><p>But some people are upset. Hillsborough County filed a suit claiming the house is a public nuisance. The suit also claims the owner never got work permit. So local government is saying \"Yabba Dabba Don't, we'll see if the 21st Century bedrock house is allowed to live, and that's near him, by the way.</p><p>PERINO: We're down to a minute and I'm sorry about that. Jesse go.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, Liz Warren says that The Flintstones show is sexist.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Is that right? Oh, thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, and then she apologize. All right. Remember last year, I brought you guys the Russian man slapping tournament?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Well, the championships are back. Here we go. You line up at the podium. You take turns slapping each other. You can't block it. This guy knocked the other guy out. Here it comes. One, two, three and he's out.</p><p>PERINO: Wow.</p><p>WATTERS: Vasily Kamotsky, he won 1,0000 Russian Rubles.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wow, that's a rough skill.</p><p>WATTERS: And I'm on \"Hannity\".</p><p>PERINO: OK. Now Emily's time. You need 10 seconds.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes, I love this story. So this sergeant father was deployed for 10 months. He came home and surprised his son in Tennessee, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>U.S. ARMY STAFF SGT. ROB CESTERNINO: You were such a big boy while I was gone. I'm so proud of you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: That is so sweet indeed. All right. Set your DVRs never miss an episode of THE FIVE.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019031901cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP2-RHX1-DXH2-62N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm Dana Perino, along with Kennedy, Bob Beckel, Eric Bolling, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City. And this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee facing new pressure to recuse himself from the probe into Russia's election meddling, as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>attempts to shift the focus to the Clintons. More on that in just a moment. Democrats are calling for <person><nameText>Devin Nunes </nameText></person>to remove himself from the Russian investigation following news that he reviewed intelligence material on the Trump team on White House grounds, and then went back to speak about it to the president. Fellow committee member, <person><nameText>Jackie Speier, </nameText></person>goes even further. She thinks that he should step down as chairman.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>REP SPEIER, </nameText></person>CALIFORNIA: If you become a White House whisperer, you are not being independent. I think he has tainted the committee. I'm asking for him to step down. In the interest of what we all care about, which is the integrity of our intelligence community.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Meanwhile, Nunes maintains that he has done nothing wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Why not recuse yourself in this investigation?</p><p><person><nameText>DEVIN NUNES, </nameText></person>HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN: I still don't know why. You guys give me a reason to recuse myself, I might consider it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Your critics say you are just too close to the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>to lead this investigation.</p><p>NUNES: I don't know that they've actually said that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And will you share your sources?</p><p>NUNES: We will never reveal sources.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You feel you can credibly lead the investigation?</p><p>NUNES: Yeah, this is politics. I understand that. People have to play different sides that they want to play. It's OK. I'm used to it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: The chairman says he won't recuse himself from the Russia probe and Speaker Ryan doesn't think he should either. Here's the White House reaction today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>SEAN SPICER, </nameText></person>U.S. WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's not up to me. He's a member of the House. He's appointed by the speaker. I do think that he's running in the investigation which we asked for. There is somewhat of a double standard when it comes to classified information. You all report on stuff with sources that are leaking, illegally leaking classified information. That's appropriate and fine. No one questions that, the substance and the material. When two individuals or however many are engaged in the process, have a discussion that is 100 percent legal and appropriate and clear, suddenly the obsession becomes about the process and not the substance.</p><p>PERINO: All right. So, Kennedy, I was away for one day and this story grew more legs. I don't know what to do here. It keeps going. And I feel like the White House -- they want to get away from it and then the president tweets about it. And we actually have his tweet here where he said about the Clinton's and why isn't there an investigation into Clinton and any money they would've taken from Russia. So he is trying to do a what-about- them?</p><p>LISA KENNEDY, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: OK. You're absolutely right because a spider has only supposed to have eight legs. And this one has turned into a centipede. But the thing is just because you sprout some new limbs doesn't give reason to amputate all the others. There may be reason to look at the Clintons, absolutely. And I think the present is right when he talks about those curious Bill Clinton speaking fees from the Russian bank that had very interesting timing with the Iranian deal that Hillary Clinton rubber- stamped when she was Secretary of State.</p><p>But having said that, <person><nameText>Devin Nunes </nameText></person>has, I think, done a really bad job of explaining himself, and he has allowed the story to consume him. And as you know, having been in a post where you really have to control a large part of the message, he has let the message get away from him. And that allows for more suspicion. And I think you know there are some important questions that are not being asked by either party. And that is, were civil liberties violated, was the law violated in the gathering of intelligence that was either untoward or illegal? And I think that's the question we deserve an answer to and we are looking in the wrong place.</p><p>PERINO: So there's really three pieces to the investigation, Eric. There is the meddling from Russia into the U.S. election, there is the allegations of collusion in the investigation about the Trump campaign and people from Russia, and then there's the unmasking and leaking. So there are actually three issues. Where do you think this goes from here because there was going to be a hearing, then there wasn't going to be a hearing? Then there are questions about whether the former deputy attorney general who was fired by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>was going to be allowed to testify. The White House disputes, the Washington reports. I am just trying to figure out, where do we go tomorrow?</p><p>ERIC BOLLING, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: It has been a flurry of news going back and forth. But again, here, we are talking about whether or not <person><nameText>Devin Nunes </nameText></person>is capable of presiding over a committee investigation. And I think he is. You may not like him, you may not like the fact that he met his source at the White House, but the bottom line is we're going to see most of that. We're going to see the testimony by most of these people. Some of it happens behind closed doors, but it's not just Nunes deposing various people. There is bipartisan representation in these things, I think he's capable of doing it, but the more controversy, the more questions surrounding why did he get out of a cab, I think you're right. You're pushing the Democrats to give you a reason to say hey, independent counsel, when you really don't need it. It's going to come out when we watch all the testimony. Yates claims or someone claimed that she wasn't allowed to testify and then they produced, or I think our John Roberts produced a letter that was sent to Yates and the lawyer responding back saying she was in fact notified of this testimony. And I think also there were supposed to be some testimony yesterday that got pushed off so that Comey and Rogers could testify. They said they weren't going to show up, so that all got delayed. In the confusion, you are right. It's time, let's just have this hearing. Let's get these people up.</p><p>PERINO: Right. And the other question is if Representative Nunes needed to go to the White House to meet somebody, why doesn't that somebody working in the White House call the White House counsel's office or the president and say I have something I really feel I need to show you. Because then the next day, Nunes goes back to the White House and then after he tells the press about it, not telling his colleagues on the committee, and briefs the president on what he heard.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: I kind of lost what you are saying there for a minute.</p><p>PERINO: I followed it perfectly well.</p><p>GUTFELD: It stinks to high heaven, Dana. This conspiracy stinks to high heaven. Who supplied Nunes with the intelligence? Ted Cruz' dad. As a way to deflect the media from Pizza Gate which is actually harboring President Obama's long form birth certificate, it all comes around. Here is the deal, Nunes is guilty of premature accusation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: He should have waited -- he should have waited a while before he actually had the information. If he held back, we wouldn't have this problem. And now, everyone is running around and we don't know a lot of the answers.</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: So we are spending all this time speculating. Meanwhile, to me, I go back to watching the media. It's amazing how they are tearing into the story like a pit-bull. You know, they are salivating because there is chum in the water. But where were they? Again, where were they when you talk about the IRS or the DOJ or Benghazi? This is why people hate the media because they are selectively investigating. They are selectively being Woodward and Bernstein. They are now hot on the story because they don't like the president. There are a lot of great stories over the last eight years that weren't covered. I want to point out that both sides are guilty, I think of this. When the Democrats say Russian collusion, the Republican say where's the evidence. When the Republicans deep-state mutiny and illegal leaks, the Libs say where is the evidence. It is like when you play rock, paper, scissors, and everybody keeps going this. It just keeps going. So just have the investigation.</p><p>BOLLING: Right.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: Paper covers rock. Bob, do you think that the Democrats really want this go to an independent counsel or special prosecutor? Because, as you know, as soon as that happens, everything goes very quiet, and then, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>would be able to drive more on his agenda and have to worry about it.</p><p>BOB BECKEL, THE FIVE SHOW CO-HOST: We don't have to worry about that. By the way, I think we should go back and investigate why there were not more Secret Service in Lincoln's assassination. It is very important.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BECKEL: Look, the fact of the matter is, Nunes was way out of line. Nobody but nobody would not at least tell their co-chairmen what is going on. The other thing that Spicer said in his way of screwing everything up, he said it was cleared. He said it was cleared. The last thing he said, it was legal and it was cleared. But when somebody cleared this guy in, called.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: But you can't get into the White House without clearance.</p><p>BECKEL: Yeah, but somebody cleared him at that hour of the night when he was coming out of a cab, coming in there and then going into some secret room, and then going behind his master, and telling them what he's got.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: You are right about the first part, but then you make this leap that no one knows and will only come out in testimony under oath. You're right. He needs to be cleared to get in. That doesn't mean he met with the person who cleared him.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: Oh, really?</p><p>BOLLING: Yeah.</p><p>BECKEL: Can I finish?</p><p>BOLLING: Please.</p><p>BECKEL: Thank you very much. Now, I forgot what I was going to say.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BECKEL: The fact of the matter is, as everybody can agree on, this is a result of the taping or intercepts of two foreign nationals, and people got caught up in that. Anybody within a half-mile range of an intercept is going to get caught up in it. Thousands of people get caught up in it. Now, the only question is, why are they named? Now, that I think is a legitimate question that ought to be answered. But Nunes not only should drop out of the committee member, he should get out of Congress and get himself a good criminal lawyer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: What you do is you take someone chatty, you know, someone like Sergey Kislyak.</p><p>BECKEL: Who?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: . like a young cool guy trying to get in. He is the Russian ambassador.</p><p>BECKEL: He got killed in Studio 54, you know.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: Yeah. Anyhow.</p><p>BOLLING: And you can't say oh, by the way, they may have named those guys. The unmasking, illegally unmasking Americans names could be a very, very serious crime.</p><p>BECKEL: It could be.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Up to 10 years imprisonment for doing that, if they do it illegally.</p><p>BECKEL: Yeah. Exactly right, but the question is, is it illegal if you do it as a sidebar investigation on Russia.</p><p>BOLLING: No.</p><p>BECKEL: . that the name comes up that you could turn it over.</p><p>BOLLING: Once you unmask them, that's the illegal act right there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: One of the things the chairman said is that some of the names weren't unmasked, but he could tell who it was because he worked on the transition.</p><p>BECKEL: He's a puppy dog.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: It might be sloppy in terms of the hiding of the names.</p><p>KENNEDY: It is like someone who is in Angela Lansbury fan watching Murder She Wrote and figuring out the ending of the show in the first seven minutes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, you, too.</p><p>KENNEDY: Does that annoy you?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: I say this once a week and I wills ay it again. The big winner is always going to be Putin. The longer the circus goes on, the harder the shirtless man on a lion laughs. He is a global stink bomb. And right now, he is in his underwater fortress rubbing his hands.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: You mentioned the IRS investigation, something along this line.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>BECKEL: This allegation, if it's true, that Putin and the Russians somehow got WikiLeaks to get this stuff out, it is they were single atrocious thing a country could do to another.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: Unmask Putin for what he is. He's a thug, he's an autocrat, and he ought to be gone, too.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: I can't believe you are agreeing with Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney said this is an act of war.</p><p>BECKEL: It certainly is. It certainly is.</p><p>PERINO: It technically is.</p><p>KENNEDY: Again, you have factions within the Republican Party.</p><p>BECKEL: If you have people around Putin who contacted the WikiLeaks and said leak that stuff, it it's an act of war. It also will ruin Trump, and it should.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. A, it could be, as Trump said, a hoax designed as paybacks for the Democrats' lost or it could be a massive scandal, an act of war by Russia to destroy a republic, or it could be a bit of both, which is the answer. C, it is a bit of both. It's never one extreme or the other. It is somewhere in the middle.</p><p>BOLLING: And can we also point out it's been going on for decades?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: The Russians are trying to influence and hack into.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: However, per the intel community saying yes they have tried, but they've been doing it for decades. And no, it had no effect on the outcome of the election.</p><p>BECKEL: They said that yes, it's true, we have intercepted them, but they have never tried to use a third party to discourage people from voting for another person.</p><p>KENNEDY: How did they do that? With fake news?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: No, with WikiLeaks and the emails.</p><p>KENNEDY: What about the emails we got from the State Department?</p><p>BECKEL: Which ones?</p><p>KENNEDY: Because of the Hillary Clinton investigation.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: Her server investigation. I mean, are you saying that the Podesta emails were somehow more damning?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: Oh, absolutely.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: It was awful. I tried to make it. The mushrooms, do not hold up with cream. My new rule is that anyone who works in news should say whoa, it is true. Don't do it ever again.</p><p>All right. Ahead, should social companies like Facebook do more to help fight terror when they have the capability to do so? Greg makes a very strong case when The Five returns.</p><p>GUTFELD: Back in the days of world wars, American companies didn't think twice about pitching in to help fight the enemy. Car companies help bolster tanks, food companies created rations, sometimes they had to do it, but no one had to twist her arm. Unlike today, consider the internet firm WhatsApp owned by Facebook. It was the communication tool used by the terrorist in last week's attack in London. So what if your product during a time of war happened to help out the enemy? It's not your fault. But why must we pressure you to help?</p><p>British home secretary Amber Rudd is calling WhatsApp out for giving the enemy a place to hide after security services failed to access the terrorist last message, which was sent minutes before he killed those innocent people. Something tells me he wasn't texting emojis to his pet goat. WhatsApp lets users send end-to-end encrypted messages, which are sealed off so Scotland Yard can't access what could be a key clue. Now, in California, it may be hard for a CEO to imagine his family being victims on that bridge last week, but why not try? If one clue prevents the deaths of loved ones, those loved ones could one day be yours.</p><p>Here is a fact. If Facebook were a religion, it will be the third largest behind Islam and Christianity. Its success is rooted and capitalizing on the human desire to bond. So if you make billions of dollars of connecting them, may be the least you can do is help keep them from being blown apart.</p><p>The thing that drives me nuts, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: Yes?</p><p>GUTFELD: I know it's not Google's fault or Facebook's fault or Twitter's fault. They are all probably wonderful people. But why do you have to these days pressure people to cooperate?</p><p>PERINO: I don't know. We go through this over and over again. And I don't know why there can't be some sort of revolution or memorandum of understanding between the companies and law enforcement, because this really is, at this point, you'd have to say are you standing with the terrorists? So, remember, you are either with us or against us.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: But I was thinking also about video cameras. Let's say that he has gone in and bought something beforehand. We have seen many convenience store cameras footage that lead us to close to figure out what happened in a crime.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: They turn it over.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yeah.</p><p>PERINO: I don't understand why then WhatsApp thinks that's any different? What benefits them? I understand privacy. I get the privacy part. But at some point, my right for privacy should be possibly superseded possibly by my right to be protected against somebody who is planning an attack.</p><p>GUTFELD: I think you can have both. And, Eric, you know, I don't understand why the war on terrorism is different from fighting the Nazis, like because it is global and it is harder to grab, I don't know what it is.</p><p>BOLLING: I would agree at that part of it. And again, this is going to be one of those philosophical discussions that we have that may be -- a lot of people don't like my stance on it. But if you ask WhatsApp to turn over, to break their encryption, you've basically told them you are going out of business. Then you talk about all the other encrypted websites to go out of business. Now, yes, I understand this whole security versus safety issue. The constitution does say until you are a target or you know, there's a court that says you are a target, you are supposed to be able to keep your privacy. Here's the sliding line. Yes, terrorism, everyone would agree, if it is a terrorist, open this out, find out who did it, and why, and how. Does murder fall in the same category? OK, fine, maybe it does? Does rape, does kidnapping, what about car theft, what about cheating on your spouse? Someone has to draw that line.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PERINO: All those are all crimes until you got to cheating on your spouse.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: Because it's a gray area, which crimes, which things do you want to break open your right to privacy?</p><p>GUTFELD: I mean, I think if there's a murder on the loose, it's enough. Kenny, what do you think?</p><p>KENNEDY: I think actually WhatsApp is showing how good their technology really is and they are doing a service to their customers because they realized this is a company like Apple in the San Bernardino case. They are not going to fall to pressure. Now, what we saw from Facebook is a statement saying no, we absolutely are doing whatever we can to work with Scotland Yard and we feel for the victims of this tragedy, and of course, of all acts of terrorism.</p><p>And by the way, these companies, these big tech companies, regularly work with law enforcement. And they honor warrants. So it's not as though they built a terrorist loving wall in Silicon Valley.</p><p>GUTFELD: I say.</p><p>KENNEDY: What they have built is technology that is so good that their customers want real encryption. That they can't break, they have no desire to break, and their customers see they are true to their word. A lot of companies would go out of business rather than kowtow to government demands. The reason people want this kind of privacy, the reason people want this kind of security is because they don't trust the government in the first place, and they don't buy into the false notion that somehow the world is safer when you have less privacy.</p><p>GUTFELD: OK. I get your point. It's almost like electricity. People use electricity for good, they use it for bad. But in this case, if you know that there are people doing evil things and you have their device, what's wrong with not cooperating and figuring out how to get into it?</p><p>BECKEL: Well, I agree. But first, I would like to say this is The Five at 5 o'clock and this is the 15th time in a row I've been asked the fifth question. OK, let me look at it this way. If you can water board terrorist, you can water board the people who run that company and find out. I have no sympathy for them whatsoever. I understand what Eric is saying. There's got to be a way for them to set up a monitoring device in their own company to look at certain messages that may or may not, let's say they are in countries like England, which has been subjected to a lot of terrorist attacks, why not have something they can put together, that filters out those countries and then informs people like Scotland Yard. I don't understand it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: You can subpoena actual texts and information. But what they're asking for is the back door. Kennedy points out the iPhone case where Apple said we are not going to give the FBI the back door into this iPhone, this terrorist's iPhone, because once you do that, you've ruined the product.</p><p>PERINO: Yeah.</p><p>BOLLING: You have basically deemed our product unnecessary. Then it becomes like any other phone. So, look, terror may be your line in the sand. Stealing from the corner bodega might be someone else's line. That's why it's a very slippery slope. Until you violate -- you have to protect innocent people's privacy.</p><p>GUTFELD: The interesting thing is you need a free society in order to create and invent great products. If you have an X-essential terrorist group that wants to end your civilization, you will not have your freedom that allows you to make these devices.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: That's the thing. There are other ways of using intelligence to capture these people and figure out what they are doing aside from encrypted chat services, including you know a lot of sites that there are conservatives and liberals want to shut them down. They want to shutdown Twitter and even Pinterest.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BOLLING: If a terrorist is hiding in a neighborhood, you don't know which house. The easiest thing to do is kick down every signal door in the neighborhood. You can't do that either because there are innocent people who don't deserve to have their door kicked down.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: That's why you can look at the phone of the other terrorist, he lives on 13 Elm Street.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Got to go. I will do it. I will decide. I got the free time, Kennedy. I do it when I get home after The Five.</p><p>All right, ahead, sanctuary city mayors fire back at the <person><nameText>Trump administration, </nameText></person>vowing to continue to find our nation's immigration, that's next.</p><p>BOLLING: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>met with a group of law enforcement officials today at the White House and pledged to work alongside them to make America safe again.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT: My highest duty as president is the security of our people, the security of our nation. That's why I've already taken numerous actions to enhance domestic security, including the creation of task force on reducing violent crime, an interagency task force to dismantle criminal cartels along with historic actions to secure our borders and remove criminals from our country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLLING: Removing illegals who have committed crime is a top priority for the president. And any local governments that won't turn them over to the feds will have their funding -- face their funding to be cut off. His attorney general issued another direct warning to sanctuary states and cities yesterday, but mayors like Chicago's Rahm Emanuel remain defiant.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR RAHM EMANUEL (D), CHICAGO: You're looking at a person who's a grandson of immigrants to the city of Chicago 100 years ago, in 1917. My grandfather came to Chicago, 13 years old, because it was a welcoming city. And we're still going to be and always will be a welcoming city, whether you're an immigrant from Poland or Pakistan, Ireland or India or Mexico or Moldovia, where my grandfather came. If you believe in the American dream, we welcome you to the city of Chicago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BOLLING: OK, Bobby, do you want to go first on this one?</p><p>BECKEL: Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. The -- first of all, what Trump said about the task force, for the last 15 years, it's become a safer and safer country. That's one thing. He's got to go to history classes. I mean, it's unbelievable.</p><p>And secondly, what we need -- what we need is not to have his attorney general say yesterday, \"We're going to cut off funding, federal funding for law enforcement.\" Exactly the kind of people you need to take care of the people who are criminals, who are illegals.</p><p>Now, I happen to be for doing all that. I am not for ripping a woman who has got cancer out of a hospital, even if she wasn't that sick, and then her kids waiting for her back in New York. That is sick, and it's a thug. And you ought to be...</p><p>GUTFELD: OK, that...</p><p>BOLLING: Can we put that to rest?</p><p>GUTFELD: That story -- we've been taking care of that woman for quite some time, and we're still taking care of her.</p><p>BECKEL: Good.</p><p>GUTFELD: Twenty-four-hour, around-the-clock.</p><p>BECKEL: Good.</p><p>GUTFELD: By the way, since I'm already yakking...</p><p>BOLLING: Can I just point one more thing about Bob pointing out that, by the way, this started under President Obama, who wanted to earmark education funding for deportation.</p><p>BECKEL: You said that yesterday, and I agree with you. Right? Bolling against sanctuary cities but in favor of a sanctuary app in the last block.</p><p>GUTFELD: What?</p><p>BOLLING: Meaning a tweet (ph).</p><p>Greg, go ahead; I'm sorry.</p><p>GUTFELD: I love the disconnect. You have a mayor of a city where the primary aerobic exercise is ducking bullets. Announcing that it's a welcoming city, that's like the captain of the Titanic asking people in the lifeboats to come back in for a drink.</p><p>This -- and also, the one argument that always comes up is that sanctuary cities are there to allow illegal aliens out of the shadows to report crimes. This is reiterated by everybody. I can't find the statistics. I looked. I haven't seen a statistic that says illegal aliens as a group are dependable sources of information for police. If somebody gives me that -- and I have a feeling Kennedy might. I don't know -- then I will say yes. But I haven't been able to find it.</p><p>PERINO: No, that...</p><p>BOLLING: Can I just bring Dana in on Rahm Emanuel? I mean, is he the guy that should be pitching this idea?</p><p>PERINO: Well, what he said was that he's proud to stand with 34 other cities and states. And so there is a caucus, so to speak. So it's not -- it's not the biggest one.</p><p>The government, the federal government uses funding as a carrot and stick approach. Right? So taking away the law enforcement would be the severe stick, whereas education funding might not have quite done it for them.</p><p>What I don't understand -- and I just maybe need more education about this -- is that Rahm Emanuel went on to say that the administration's plan to deny federal funds to cities that are standing up for their values is unconstitutional. That part I don't understand, how it is unconstitutional for the federal government to be able to decide.</p><p>BECKEL: Well, all this is going to be in courts. They're never going to...</p><p>PERINO: What is the constitutional harm?</p><p>BECKEL: I don't know, but it's going to be in the courts.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes, and what is the -- what is the obligation of the federal government to be funding cities in the first place?</p><p>I agree with you that I don't think that we should be withholding funding from law enforcement, particularly if the argument is that crime is going up. I don't think you can necessarily say it's only because of illegal immigrant criminal activity.</p><p>But I will say, to your point, that oftentimes immigrants are a very valuable source of intelligence for law enforcement.</p><p>BECKEL: The FBI...</p><p>KENNEDY: And when you go into communities, especially local cops, they have to be able to talk to people and get information. My brother was a cop for a long time. And we talked about this. Adding an extra layer...</p><p>GUTFELD: Anecdotal evidence, Kennedy. I'm disappointed in you.</p><p>KENNEDY: No, it's not...</p><p>PERINO: I'll allow it.</p><p>KENNEDY: But here's what I will say. Oftentimes, we -- when we're talking about the war on terror, there's not enough human intelligence. That's something they could learn from local police departments, who really go out, canvass these communities and find criminals.</p><p>BECKEL: The FBI has reported 15 years straight decline in violent crime.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: I have one last...</p><p>BOLLING: Overall.</p><p>PERINO: ... final quick point, which is that one of the best things about being in power at the White House is that you have the power to convene. And so the president has been having all these meanings. And tomorrow his secretary of Department of Homeland Security, General Kelly, is going to meet with a group of mayors. And I wish I could be there, because it's quite a diverse group. It's not everybody from sanctuary cities. It's a real mix. And they're going to be talking about the executive order on immigration and sanctuary cities. So the power to convene, at least to get people talking, is one of the best things they could do.</p><p>BOLLING: All right. We've got to go.</p><p><person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>fulfilling another campaign promise today, this time undoing President Obama's climate change agenda. Details coming up.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. This afternoon, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed a new executive order, this one rolling back his predecessor's efforts to combat climate change. The order dismantles a number of Obama-era environmental regulations, ones he says have hurt oil drillers and coal miners.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The action I'm taking today will eliminate federal overreach, restore economic freedom, and allow our companies and our workers to thrive.</p><p>The miners told me about the attacks on their jobs and their livelihoods.</p><p>I made them this promise: We will put our miners back to work. With today's executive action, I am taking historic steps to lift the restrictions on American energy, to reverse government intrusion, and to cancel job-killing regulations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KENNEDY: These regulations, they are job killers, but I'm not a Bob killer. I want to know exactly how you feel about the president's promise. West Virginia coal miners, coal miners in Pennsylvania, and other areas of the country, they are eagerly awaiting this great news that their jobs will be returned.</p><p>BECKEL: Have you ever seen them take off the top of a mountain to get at the coal and send it all down into where the creeks are, and it all backs up and people lose their houses? Probably not.</p><p>PERINO: You're talking about mountaintop mining. It's very rare.</p><p>BECKEL: Let me do it this way. The one thing about climate change, most, even the amateurs he listens to, will agree that the sea levels are rising. The first place I hope drowns is Mar-a-Lago and all of his billionaire friends.</p><p>The idea that you would send this thing back. Yes, there's some things that are overreach. I agree with that. But for the most part, they are not. We've worked hard to have this. Every year the Republicans want to do away with clean water and clean air acts. They don't get away with it. And the reason for it is, they usually live in nice places and better houses and have never been around a poor person who lives in a place where they could...</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>BECKEL: Name me one. Name me one.</p><p>GUTFELD: What are you talking about?</p><p>KENNEDY: Chuck Schumer is yelling at people at the most expensive Italian restaurant in the city.</p><p>BECKEL: Name me a Republican around Trump that worked, lived in a poor...</p><p>GUTFELD: Climate change is about cost versus reward.</p><p>BECKEL: I see.</p><p>GUTFELD: Are you willing to spend $1 trillion a year over a century to reduce the temperature by a fraction of a degree?</p><p>BECKEL: Yes. Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: A fraction that might actually be beneficial to the people you don't know in other countries. By the way, a slightly warmer climate, Bob, is beneficial then a slightly colder climate. You will save hundreds of thousands of lives a year with a slightly warmer climate.</p><p>BECKEL: Who is the quack you -- who is the quack you used to listen to, used to have on here all the time? The loudmouth who never went to college? The climate change guy.</p><p>GUTFELD: What are you talking about?</p><p>BOLLING: He wrote a book. Anyway.</p><p>GUTFELD: That was really, really remarkably intelligent.</p><p>BOLLING: You're not talking about Al Gore, who promised that New York City would be underwater by 2015 from -- due to climate change and the rising sea levels?</p><p>BECKEL: No, I'm not talking about him.</p><p>BOLLING: He did go to college. That's right. He made a billion dollars off of it.</p><p>KENNEDY: Let's talk about some of the president's promises. He said that we're going to have fewer regulations and a cleaner environment. Is it possible, Eric, to have both?</p><p>PERINO: Yes. Sorry.</p><p>BOLLING: Yes, I think -- listen, here's what -- Bob is eliminating the other part of the equation, where, when you do eliminate some of these regulations and restrictions, you open up the oil industry, which happens to provide millions of decent to high-paying jobs for people who need jobs right now. That's what this is all about. It's keeping the cost of energy down, but it's also one of the most employed industries.</p><p>GUTFELD: But Bob's got a job in TV. He doesn't care about them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BECKEL: You make fun of me; it's hard to believe. I happen to think the oil industry does a very good job and moves a lot of product every day, and nothing goes wrong. I'm not against the oil industry.</p><p>KENNEDY: I guess my question is why would you want to kneecap an industry that can still continue to make money? Because we have not made the shift to renewable resources. We are still using fossil fuels. The previous administration tried to shut that down and eliminate that stream of revenue. And when you do that, you stifle innovation. So you don't have the capital to invest...</p><p>PERINO: Spend, yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: ... in renewable energy.</p><p>PERINO: Right, so this goes around and around, and it's been going this way since about 1992.</p><p>When <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>came into office, he said, \"Every policy I think about, I'm going to think about jobs first. So how does this affect jobs?\"</p><p>I thought it was very bold for him to go to the EPA today to sign this. Because most people that work at the EPA, they believed in this so much.</p><p>But here's the catch. This Clean Power Plan that President Obama put in place, it's actually not in place. Guess why? Because the Supreme Court in February of 2016 said this is a huge overreach by the EPA. So it's been in court, and it's not even in place.</p><p>But the other thing he announced today, which I think will be beneficial, is that back in the Obama administration, they did this thing called a guidance, basically, that said every project that goes through the government has to have some sort of a carbon check to see. So that goes away. It doesn't mean that you can't have a clean environment if you also add more market principles. You can do that. And it also doesn't mean that you can't continue to have international dialogue. All that stuff can continue.</p><p>BECKEL: He went to...</p><p>KENNEDY: More innovation, more technology.</p><p>BECKEL: He went to the EPA today for one very real reason. He's going to tear it apart. It won't be there next year. One signature down. He put a guy in there who's an anti-EPA guy, who's ripping it apart left by left. And maybe they'll be -- left by right. And maybe there'll be a brick left that we can all hand around.</p><p>KENNEDY: That is...</p><p>BOLLING: To answer your original question to me...</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>BOLLING: ... the way you do it is you do it, free market forces. You provide tax incentive for companies to use cleaner and more efficient ways of bringing up...</p><p>BECKEL: Is that what they do at Standard Oil?</p><p>BOLLING: ... oil, getting it out of the ground and also transport it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Nuclear. Time for nuclear.</p><p>PERINO: The typical -- the typical answer is going to be robotic.</p><p>KENNEDY: Teslas for everyone.</p><p>GUTFELD: Clean, cheap and awesome.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right. Wow. Great description.</p><p>All right. Coming up, have you been feeling a little lonely lately? Maybe a little blue? Well, there could be a quick cure. Dr. Beckel reveals one remedy, and it is hot, hot, hot. Grab the oven mitts. That's next.</p><p>BECKEL: Social media sites like Facebook and Instagram or Snapchat are designed to bring people together. But according to a recent study, they're making a lot of us losers -- users look like we're feeling isolated and depressed. So if you're one feeling lonely, you might want to cut down on those things.</p><p>All my colleagues out here have theirs out every break. But I want to find out, then, Eric, are you feeling lonely or anything like that?</p><p>BOLLING: When I actually go on Facebook and Twitter? No, I don't. I'm not sure what the study was all about, but I thought it was funny, your \"losers\" when you meant to say \"users.\"</p><p>BECKEL: Users. I can't -- my eyes aren't good. I can't read that far.</p><p>BOLLING: It doesn't make me feel lonely.</p><p>PERINO: I don't feel lonely, but I can see how it could make you feel more isolated. So, like, if you feel like you can get all the social interaction that you need right here on your phone, then why do you ever need to leave your couch?</p><p>BECKEL: Good point. My son and his girlfriend text each other in the same room. That's the problem.</p><p>PERINO: That's common.</p><p>KENNEDY: They're talking behind your back. That's why.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it's like, \"He's not going to bed.\" Anyway. \"When will he go to bed?\"</p><p>Social interaction is our survival mechanism, like water. But you can drown in water. And I really do think we're cheapening it, social interaction by doing too much of it.</p><p>It's like, when you were -- I was thinking about this, about this topic. When you are a teenager and you had a crush, you had, like, one picture of that person. Do you remember? You used to have a picture of that person? And it was a really special picture.</p><p>BECKEL: And she had clothes on, too.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Clothes on. That's good, Bob. You treated it like a diamond.</p><p>But now you have 1,000 pictures every day, and you lose value in it. There's too much of one thing. And you should have just one thing and study the wrinkles in the lips, study every part of it rather than have too many of one thing.</p><p>KENNEDY: Who were you dating? Florence Henderson?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it was Angela Lansbury, as a matter of fact.</p><p>KENNEDY: That's right. You're the one with the...</p><p>GUTFELD: She was quite the spry play girl in my time.</p><p>KENNEDY: Bob.</p><p>BECKEL: Yes?</p><p>KENNEDY: Hi! I actually think there is something to this study. Because Greg is absolutely right. Signaling and communicating, they are essential. Not only as human beings but as primates. If you look at other primates, that's what they do. They, like, make faces, and they pick nits. And that's what we're doing when we send each other emojis.</p><p>But the thing that's isolating is when you look at other people's social media; and you realize what they're doing without you.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: And that's what is so hurtful and off-putting to people. And the ones who participated in the study were between the ages of 19 and 32. Which, you know in this day and age, those are all still adolescents.</p><p>BECKEL: You know, primates are probably better than we are now, too. And I can say one thing -- \"One More Thing\" is up next. See, she didn't jump.</p><p>PERINO: Very calm.</p><p>BECKEL: That's amazing.</p><p>KENNEDY: Was I supposed to?</p><p>BECKEL: Are you on drugs?</p><p>KENNEDY: Not yet. You holding?</p><p>BECKEL: No, because -- no. Not no more. A long time ago.</p><p>GUTFELD: We should've gone to break by now, I think.</p><p>BECKEL: But Kimberly used to jump right out of her seat.</p><p>KENNEDY: Are we on the air?</p><p>BECKEL: OK, We're out. We're out. Goodbye, goodbye. Goodbye.</p><p>GUTFELD: But come back.</p><p>PERINO: It's time now for \"One More Thing,\" and I'm going to go first.</p><p>OK, \"60 Minutes\" did a piece this weekend about a chess teacher named Jeff Bulington or Dr. B, as he's known. It's in a small community of Franklin County, Mississippi. So there was an anonymous benefactor who thought that Dr. B would be able to help mold more people, so he decided to start teaching chess. He thought about a dozen would come. But get this. Now there's hundreds of kids that come, and they are all able to play at a national level. He teaches the fifth and sixth graders how to play chess, and then he teaches them to win or lose very gracefully. Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Can the best chess player in the world come from Franklin County?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Maybe.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Absolutely.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Super possible.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you feel like chess has made the community more hopeful?</p><p>DR. JEFF BULINGTON, TEACHES CHESS: Certainly parts of it. I mean, this flower hasn't bloomed yet. It's just starting to. Right? There's -- there's a lot yet to come.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: It's amazing what one person can do. Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: He seems to bring a lot of peace to those children.</p><p>PERINO: The children, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: The children. What about the children?</p><p>All right. It's time for this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Greg's Corrections.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Last Friday, this happened on \"The Five.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: What is your favorite kitchen utensil and why?</p><p>PERINO: It's an electric water kettle.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: You know, like a hot water kettle.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right, right, right. Saves a lot of time.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Saves a lot of time. You push a button.</p><p>PERINO: Yes, you make tea and...</p><p>GUTFELD: You can make all sorts of things.</p><p>PERINO: ... clean the sink, things like that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: The National Utensil Society contacted me immediately, actually over the weekend while I was at home, and said an electric kettle is not a utensil. It's an appliance.</p><p>PERINO: Oh!</p><p>GUTFELD: \"Please issue an immediate retraction before we take legal action.\" So I want to apologize immediately to the National Utensil Society for labeling a kettle.</p><p>PERINO: And I am mortified.</p><p>GUTFELD: You should be mortified.</p><p>PERINO: Sorry.</p><p>BOLLING: I'm sorry, it was fast and loose with the words.</p><p>PERINO: Sorry.</p><p>GUTFELD: And I regret if I offended you.</p><p>PERINO: OK, a utensil. I've got to think about it. I don't cook very much.</p><p>GUTFELD: Put the \"U\" in \"utensil.\"</p><p>PERINO: All right, Bob, you're next.</p><p>BECKEL: I want to just take a minute and think all the viewers of \"The Five.\" You've been loyal. You've been -- a lot of you. And we appreciate it very much.</p><p>Yesterday there was a little girl who was standing outside the studio here with a sign that she had made, and in his good way, Eric Bolling went over and talked to her and got her to put the sign up. And the producers opened up the windows. And that's the kind of thing that I think brings people to \"The Five.\" Because it really is a family feeling, and Eric grabbed hold of it yesterday. And when I walked out, the little girl said it was the most important day of her life.</p><p>PERINO: Aww.</p><p>BOLLING: Is that right?</p><p>PERINO: I heard Jasper was in the picture.</p><p>BOLLING: Jasper was up top in the -- on the poster. They were from Florida. They were a really nice little family. They watch it. And she was, like, a 12-year-old girl that loves \"The Five.\"</p><p>PERINO: I love that.</p><p>You're next.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bob, what was your original \"One More Thing\"?</p><p>BECKEL: You stole it. I was going to congratulate her for going to Bosnia, wherever it was.</p><p>GUTFELD: Bosnia.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, Benin?</p><p>Eric, you're next.</p><p>BOLLING: OK. OK, so a bunch of economic numbers came through today. Stock market jumped 151 points on the basis of consumer confidence jumping to another 16-year high, and home prices up, 31-month high.</p><p>But this is the -- this tax deal that Trump needs to put together is super, super important. He really has to get this thing done And one of the ways to pay for some of it or another way to stimulate the economy is a repatriation plan I've been working on since literally 2009. Bob.</p><p>Two to $3 trillion sitting overseas bank accounts by corporations here in the U.S. If they brought that money back, it would cost them 35 percent. So they're not bringing it back. They've been taxed over there. They're keeping it there.</p><p>Bring it back at zero, take a quarter of that money, put it into, invest it into your own company. Your own company. Corporate investments to match the stimulus plan. That would create about 500 to $750 billion in stimulus.</p><p>BECKEL: And who was one of the first people in favor of this? I was.</p><p>PERINO: Bob, are still for it?</p><p>BECKEL: I am, yes. I think it's a great idea.</p><p>PERINO: All right. Kennedy, take us home.</p><p>KENNEDY: All right, baby. I am competing in the Lava Land Triathlon. I'm leaving for Hawaii tomorrow.</p><p>BOLLING: You're what?</p><p>KENNEDY: I'm going to be in Kona for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Foundation.</p><p>BECKEL: Coma is right.</p><p>KENNEDY: No, in Kona, Hawaii. My mom is a lymphoma survivor, God bless her, and I am racing in her honor and raising money. You can go to my Twitter right now, @KennedyNation, and donate generously.</p><p>PERINO: Awesome.</p><p>KENNEDY: Very excited for the warm weather. Tough race.</p><p>BECKEL: You were great.</p><p>PERINO: Send us a picture.</p><p>All right. Set your DVR so you never miss an episode of \"The Five.\" That is it for us. \"Special\" -- very \"Special Report\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2017032801cb258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N6B-K0S1-JB20-G1G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"03\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>March 28, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nunes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cyber Security</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crime</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lifestyle</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Some compared it to a bank, a commodity or an exchange traded fund.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not a bank, or an exchange traded fund, but it is similar to a commodity, David Marcus, who heads Calibra, Facebook's cryptocurrency subsidiary, told the House Financial Services Committee. \"We would like for Libra to be a digital, global currency, and to be one unit of digital currency for the whole world,\" Marcus said during more than four hours of testimony.</p><p>That didn't clear things up for some lawmakers.</p><p>\"Which is it, fish or fowl? It seems more like a platypus to me,\" Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Mich.) said.</p><p>Facebook says the cryptocurrency would bridge a gap in the global financial system for people who lack access to traditional banking by allowing people to send and transfer money quickly - and with almost no fees. But just how it would be regulated in the United States and around the world is still unclear and could determine its ultimate success.</p><p>On Wednesday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire joined Libra's international skeptics, saying it could not move forward without strict rules. \"There is also a concern about money laundering, there's a concern about the funding of terrorism,\" Le Maire told CNBC.</p><p>Facebook is facing increasing pressure on Capitol Hill, where a bipartisan chorus of lawmakers has questioned whether Libra would threaten government-backed currencies and jeopardize consumers' data. Marcus defended the project before the Senate on Tuesday and faced equally skeptical House members on Wednesday.</p><p>Some Republicans praised Facebook's innovation but still expressed doubts. \"Just because we may not fully understand a new technology proposal does not mean we should immediately call for its prohibition,\" said Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (N.C.), the ranking Republican on the committee. \"But let's face it, let's be honest, it's Facebook, and I'm skeptical.\" </p><p>Facebook, which has been engulfed in controversy for more than two years, is facing widespread distrust in Washington. Some Democrats have called for breaking up the tech giant. Last week, the Federal Trade Commission approved a $5 billion settlement with the company over its privacy practices.</p><p>At Wednesday's hearing, Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) compared Facebook to two other companies that have faced scandals, Wells Fargo and Equifax. \"It has already harmed vast numbers of people on a scale similar to Wells Fargo and demonstrated a pattern of failing to keep consumer data private on a scale similar to Equifax,\" she said. Waters has unveiled draft legislation that would block big tech companies from getting involved with the financial system, potentially preventing Facebook from launching Libra.</p><p>Another Democrat, Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), said Facebook should drop the idea altogether or at least agree to start with a small pilot program. \"I don't think you should launch Libra at all. The creation of a new currency is a core government function and should be left to democratically accountable institutions,\" Maloney said.</p><p>Several Republicans questioned whether Facebook would prevent people already banned from using its social network from using Libra. \"Can Milo Yiannopoulos or Louis Farrakhan use Libra?\" Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R-Wis.) asked. Marcus said he didn't know yet. (Earlier this year, Facebook banned Farrakhan and Yiannapoulos from its network for being \"dangerous.\")</p><p>Facebook will not rush development of the cryptocurrency and has already started talking with potential regulators in the United States and around the world, Marcus said. \"I believe we're owning [our] mistakes and working hard in remedying them and working hard at improving on all fronts,\" he said.</p><p>Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) equated Libra's innovative potential to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. \"Although this may do more to endanger America than even that,\" he said.</p><p>Sherman also gave Libra another name. \"If it finally happens, nobody's going to call it Libra; they're going to call it a Zuck Buck. This is Zuckerberg's baby,\" he said, referring to Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-70184b9323084d1e93575b5da6d8e31f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKH-7MN1-JB4M-V205-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"715\"/><timeReceived>6:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

Yet our political leaders, as if stuck in a time warp, keep peddling a bleak narrative of economic victimhood and defeatism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Populists tell U.S. workers \u201cglobal capitalism\u201d is rigged against them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for breaking up \u201cbig tech\u201d America\u2019s most innovative companies\u2014because they are, well, just too big. Among millennials, socialism\u2019s stock is soaring. Even some prominent libertarians are defecting from the free market camp and learning to love the welfare state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What a change from the 1990s, when nearly everyone seemed certain that socialism was dead and buried and democratic capitalism reigned supreme around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The economic gloom enveloping the nation\u2019s political, academic and media elites trickles down to the public at large. According to a new Pew survey, Americans today are strikingly pessimistic about the future. They see the United States as declining economically, growing more unequal and becoming even more divided politically. Whatever happened to Americans\u2019 native optimism?</p><p>They\u2019ve been sideswiped by three disruptive developments. The first is the advent of a globally connected knowledge economy, which has taken a toll on blue collar America. Second, market democracies in this century got stuck in a slow growth/high inequality rut, while autocratic China surged ahead. The rancid cherry on top of these structural changes was the Great Recession of 2007-2009, intensified by the housing crisis and Wall Street\u2019s near meltdown.</p><p>This perfect economic storm has swept away middle-income jobs, slowed productivity and wage gains and undermined the traditional foundations of working- and middle-class security, especially in the Rust Belt and rural communities. It\u2019s also created a ton of new technology and wealth, while delivering lopsided rewards to highly educated and cosmopolitan elites. Mix in the combustible new politics of immigration and identity, and you have a surefire formula for political radicalization, from the Tea Party and Trumpean nationalism on the right to Sen. Bernie Sanders and the neo-socialist left.</p><p>Buffeted by these ideological crosscurrents, it\u2019s easy to lose your political bearings. Yet while Donald Trump may hate free trade, and millennials may get a transgressive rush from posturing as \u201cdemocratic socialists,\u201d most Americans haven\u2019t lost their deep-rooted faith in economic freedom, individual enterprise and market competition. A Gallup poll last year, for example, found that the public overwhelmingly (79 percent) expresses a favorable view of \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapitalism\u201d doesn\u2019t fare so well, especially among young people. Nearly half of millennial and Generation Z respondents in a recent Axios survey said they prefer living in a socialist country. Such attitudes likely are a spasm of protest against the diminished economic prospects facing young Americans, especially the 60 percent who don\u2019t have a college degree. They\u2019ve experienced a shrinking pool of stable, middle-income jobs, stagnant or falling wage growth, escalating student debt and exorbitantly high college and housing costs.</p><p>*</p><p>IT\u2019S CALLED HISTORY</p><p>Do Today\u2019s Young Socialists Know What Socialism Even Is?</p><p>Ronald Radosh</p><p>But let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Previous generations endured much harder economic times, yet they didn\u2019t jettison the foundational beliefs in economic liberty, individual initiative and free markets that have made America the world\u2019s wealthiest country.</p><p>The Great Depression hit America like an asteroid. After the stock market crashed in 1929, production plunged and the nation\u2019s economic output was cut almost in half. In 1932, nearly 2,300 banks failed; the following year, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the jobless rate hit nearly 25 percent. Legions of hobos roamed the nation desperate for work, and discouraged immigrants steamed back to Europe. It took nearly a decade for the economy to recover, mainly due to America\u2019s entry into World War II.</p><p>The recent downturn and financial crisis was no picnic, but it pales in comparison. Nonetheless, both calamities shook public confidence in prevailing economic orthodoxy. The GOP\u2019s laissez faire policies of the 1920s gave way to the New Deal\u2019s prolific federal interventions on behalf of the jobless, farmers, wage earners, depositors, retirees, and poor mothers. Some of FDR\u2019s advisors urged him to replace free market chaos with \u201cplanned economy.\u201d Sen. Huey Long and Father Coughlin lead protest movements demanding that Washington \u201cshare the wealth\u201d and combat the machinations of \u201cinternational bankers.\u201d</p><p>Roosevelt himself, however, neither succumbed to populist rage nor the collectivist doctrines spreading across Europe. Instead, he radiated a jaunty confidence that prosperity would soon return. And he always insisted his goal was to restore free enterprise, not replace it, by creating a public counterbalance to private economic power.</p><p>That\u2019s why FDR is a better model for today\u2019s progressives than Bernie Sanders. Democrats won\u2019t build national majorities by rote business-bashing or prattling about socialism, which has never captured Americans\u2019 political imagination.</p><p>Yet the Berniecrats and Demsocs flay the private sector as a squalid den of greed. To redeem capitalism\u2019s moral failings, they propose a stupendous program of top-down redistribution\u2014Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, \u201cfree college,\u201d guaranteed government jobs\u2014and they insist that all Democrats walk the plank. Such sectarian purity tests are a real problem, because ideas that may electrify activists in deep blue Brooklyn may repel moderate and independent voters in swing districts in Michigan or Iowa.</p><p>The left\u2019s equation of boldness with statism is equally oblivious to another political reality: Most Americans mistrust the federal government. In a recent PPI/Expedition Strategies poll, for example, only 20 percent of voters expressed confidence in Washington\u2019s responsiveness to their concerns or problem-solving abilities.</p><p>If they want to deny Trump a second term, Democrats should disabuse themselves of the pernicious myth that \u201cneoliberalism\u201d has destroyed the American dream. The anti-capitalism narrative contains some elements of truth, but vastly understates the role of technologically-driven economic change while overstating the role of policy. All the West\u2019s advanced economies have experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs and union membership, slow productivity and economic growth, and rising inequality. This suggests deep structural forces are at work, not a sinister plot by global elites to plunder the proletariat.</p><p>The \u201cneoliberal\u201d trope also mushes together Republican and Democratic presidents whose policies differed in intent and result. If Ronald Reagan, the two Bushes, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama can all be lumped together as capitalist tools, what does calling them \u201cneoliberals\u201d convey beyond a general antipathy to free markets?</p><p>The truth is, all U.S. presidents going back to FDR supported trade liberalizing treaties, paid at least lip service to fiscal discipline, tried to strike reasonable balances between economic innovation and regulation, preferred work to the dole, and extolled private enterprise as the mighty engine of U.S. prosperity.</p><p>U.S. voters\u2014especially in the key battleground states of the Midwest\u2014are hungry for economic hope. They want to see the middle of the middle class grow again, and don\u2019t want to be forced to choose between growth and equity, vibrant markets and reasonable redistribution.</p><p>How can Democrats speak to the public\u2019s economic aspirations? Not by giving up on growth and painting a dreary picture of a future in which robots steal our jobs, workers can\u2019t live on what they earn, America can\u2019t compete with China and politics degenerates into battles over how to carve up a stagnant economic pie.</p><p>Instead, Democrats in 2020 should present voters with radically pragmatic ideas for helping Americans get ahead. For example, let\u2019s give working people tax relief by eliminating the regressive payroll tax and replacing it with carbon and consumption taxes. Instead of promising free college tuition, create a robust system of career education and upskilling for the 70 percent of young Americans who don\u2019t go to or finish college.</p><p>Instead of a fanciful Green New Deal, Democrats should accelerate the mass production of electric cars, which would link carbon reduction to the creation of high-wage jobs for working people. Instead of breaking up tech companies, we should speed up digitizing the physical industries and create incubators for 3-D enabled manufacturing startups across the Rust Belt.</p><p>Democrats, in short, have an opportunity in 2020 to seize the high ground of economic optimism and innovation. Donald Trump has vacated that ground by embracing an odd amalgam of conservative and populist stances, including tariffs that hurt U.S. producers and consumers, closed borders, false promises to \u201cbring back\u201d old factory jobs, tax cuts skewed to the rich and paid for by huge public deficits, not to mention his perverse crusade to strip millions of Americans of health insurance.</p><p>On the other side, the Demsocs want Democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left-wing version of Trump\u2019s splenetic and divisive populism. Instead, Democrats should channel the spirit of FDR and present voters with a hope-inspiring plan for how a reinvigorated private sector and government can work together to restore shared prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2209403561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-1SM1-JBHT-D3H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reagan, Ronald Wilson</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michigan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obama, Barack</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roosevelt, Franklin Delano (1882-1945)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Clinton, Bill</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iowa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>American history</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls &amp;

Yet our political leaders, as if stuck in a time warp, keep peddling a bleak narrative of economic victimhood and defeatism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Populists tell U.S. workers \u201cglobal capitalism\u201d is rigged against them. Sen. Elizabeth Warren calls for breaking up \u201cbig tech\u201d America\u2019s most innovative companies\u2014because they are, well, just too big. Among millennials, socialism\u2019s stock is soaring. Even some prominent libertarians are defecting from the free market camp and learning to love the welfare state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What a change from the 1990s, when nearly everyone seemed certain that socialism was dead and buried and democratic capitalism reigned supreme around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The economic gloom enveloping the nation\u2019s political, academic and media elites trickles down to the public at large. According to a new Pew survey, Americans today are strikingly pessimistic about the future. They see the United States as declining economically, growing more unequal and becoming even more divided politically. Whatever happened to Americans\u2019 native optimism?</p><p>They\u2019ve been sideswiped by three disruptive developments. The first is the advent of a globally connected knowledge economy, which has taken a toll on blue collar America. Second, market democracies in this century got stuck in a slow growth/high inequality rut, while autocratic China surged ahead. The rancid cherry on top of these structural changes was the Great Recession of 2007-2009, intensified by the housing crisis and Wall Street\u2019s near meltdown.</p><p>This perfect economic storm has swept away middle-income jobs, slowed productivity and wage gains and undermined the traditional foundations of working- and middle-class security, especially in the Rust Belt and rural communities. It\u2019s also created a ton of new technology and wealth, while delivering lopsided rewards to highly educated and cosmopolitan elites. Mix in the combustible new politics of immigration and identity, and you have a surefire formula for political radicalization, from the Tea Party and Trumpean nationalism on the right to Sen. Bernie Sanders and the neo-socialist left.</p><p>Buffeted by these ideological crosscurrents, it\u2019s easy to lose your political bearings. Yet while Donald Trump may hate free trade, and millennials may get a transgressive rush from posturing as \u201cdemocratic socialists,\u201d most Americans haven\u2019t lost their deep-rooted faith in economic freedom, individual enterprise and market competition. A Gallup poll last year, for example, found that the public overwhelmingly (79 percent) expresses a favorable view of \u201cfree enterprise.\u201d</p><p>\u201cCapitalism\u201d doesn\u2019t fare so well, especially among young people. Nearly half of millennial and Generation Z respondents in a recent Axios survey said they prefer living in a socialist country. Such attitudes likely are a spasm of protest against the diminished economic prospects facing young Americans, especially the 60 percent who don\u2019t have a college degree. They\u2019ve experienced a shrinking pool of stable, middle-income jobs, stagnant or falling wage growth, escalating student debt and exorbitantly high college and housing costs.</p><p>*</p><p>IT\u2019S CALLED HISTORY</p><p>Do Today\u2019s Young Socialists Know What Socialism Even Is?</p><p>Ronald Radosh</p><p>But let\u2019s keep things in perspective. Previous generations endured much harder economic times, yet they didn\u2019t jettison the foundational beliefs in economic liberty, individual initiative and free markets that have made America the world\u2019s wealthiest country.</p><p>The Great Depression hit America like an asteroid. After the stock market crashed in 1929, production plunged and the nation\u2019s economic output was cut almost in half. In 1932, nearly 2,300 banks failed; the following year, as Franklin D. Roosevelt took office, the jobless rate hit nearly 25 percent. Legions of hobos roamed the nation desperate for work, and discouraged immigrants steamed back to Europe. It took nearly a decade for the economy to recover, mainly due to America\u2019s entry into World War II.</p><p>The recent downturn and financial crisis was no picnic, but it pales in comparison. Nonetheless, both calamities shook public confidence in prevailing economic orthodoxy. The GOP\u2019s laissez faire policies of the 1920s gave way to the New Deal\u2019s prolific federal interventions on behalf of the jobless, farmers, wage earners, depositors, retirees, and poor mothers. Some of FDR\u2019s advisors urged him to replace free market chaos with \u201cplanned economy.\u201d Sen. Huey Long and Father Coughlin lead protest movements demanding that Washington \u201cshare the wealth\u201d and combat the machinations of \u201cinternational bankers.\u201d</p><p>Roosevelt himself, however, neither succumbed to populist rage nor the collectivist doctrines spreading across Europe. Instead, he radiated a jaunty confidence that prosperity would soon return. And he always insisted his goal was to restore free enterprise, not replace it, by creating a public counterbalance to private economic power.</p><p>That\u2019s why FDR is a better model for today\u2019s progressives than Bernie Sanders. Democrats won\u2019t build national majorities by rote business-bashing or prattling about socialism, which has never captured Americans\u2019 political imagination.</p><p>Yet the Berniecrats and Demsocs flay the private sector as a squalid den of greed. To redeem capitalism\u2019s moral failings, they propose a stupendous program of top-down redistribution\u2014Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, \u201cfree college,\u201d guaranteed government jobs\u2014and they insist that all Democrats walk the plank. Such sectarian purity tests are a real problem, because ideas that may electrify activists in deep blue Brooklyn may repel moderate and independent voters in swing districts in Michigan or Iowa.</p><p>The left\u2019s equation of boldness with statism is equally oblivious to another political reality: Most Americans mistrust the federal government. In a recent PPI/Expedition Strategies poll, for example, only 20 percent of voters expressed confidence in Washington\u2019s responsiveness to their concerns or problem-solving abilities.</p><p>If they want to deny Trump a second term, Democrats should disabuse themselves of the pernicious myth that \u201cneoliberalism\u201d has destroyed the American dream. The anti-capitalism narrative contains some elements of truth, but vastly understates the role of technologically-driven economic change while overstating the role of policy. All the West\u2019s advanced economies have experienced a decline in manufacturing jobs and union membership, slow productivity and economic growth, and rising inequality. This suggests deep structural forces are at work, not a sinister plot by global elites to plunder the proletariat.</p><p>The \u201cneoliberal\u201d trope also mushes together Republican and Democratic presidents whose policies differed in intent and result. If Ronald Reagan, the two Bushes, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama can all be lumped together as capitalist tools, what does calling them \u201cneoliberals\u201d convey beyond a general antipathy to free markets?</p><p>The truth is, all U.S. presidents going back to FDR supported trade liberalizing treaties, paid at least lip service to fiscal discipline, tried to strike reasonable balances between economic innovation and regulation, preferred work to the dole, and extolled private enterprise as the mighty engine of U.S. prosperity.</p><p>U.S. voters\u2014especially in the key battleground states of the Midwest\u2014are hungry for economic hope. They want to see the middle of the middle class grow again, and don\u2019t want to be forced to choose between growth and equity, vibrant markets and reasonable redistribution.</p><p>How can Democrats speak to the public\u2019s economic aspirations? Not by giving up on growth and painting a dreary picture of a future in which robots steal our jobs, workers can\u2019t live on what they earn, America can\u2019t compete with China and politics degenerates into battles over how to carve up a stagnant economic pie.</p><p>Instead, Democrats in 2020 should present voters with radically pragmatic ideas for helping Americans get ahead. For example, let\u2019s give working people tax relief by eliminating the regressive payroll tax and replacing it with carbon and consumption taxes. Instead of promising free college tuition, create a robust system of career education and upskilling for the 70 percent of young Americans who don\u2019t go to or finish college.</p><p>Instead of a fanciful Green New Deal, Democrats should accelerate the mass production of electric cars, which would link carbon reduction to the creation of high-wage jobs for working people. Instead of breaking up tech companies, we should speed up digitizing the physical industries and create incubators for 3-D enabled manufacturing startups across the Rust Belt.</p><p>Democrats, in short, have an opportunity in 2020 to seize the high ground of economic optimism and innovation. Donald Trump has vacated that ground by embracing an odd amalgam of conservative and populist stances, including tariffs that hurt U.S. producers and consumers, closed borders, false promises to \u201cbring back\u201d old factory jobs, tax cuts skewed to the rich and paid for by huge public deficits, not to mention his perverse crusade to strip millions of Americans of health insurance.</p><p>On the other side, the Demsocs want Democrats to reject free enterprise in favor of a left-wing version of Trump\u2019s splenetic and divisive populism. Instead, Democrats should channel the spirit of FDR and present voters with a hope-inspiring plan for how a reinvigorated private sector and government can work together to restore shared prosperity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2209403561</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK2-S3P1-DY0W-4100-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1597\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 14, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0009DNU</classCode><className>GEOPHARMA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS325412 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC2834 PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democratic Party</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Trump, Donald J</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Reagan, Ronald Wilson</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Michigan</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Obama, Barack</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Roosevelt, Franklin Delano (1882-1945)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Clinton, Bill</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Iowa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>American history</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls &amp;

I'm Dana Perino along with Emily Compagno, Juan Williams, Jesse Watters, and Greg Gutfeld. It's 5 o'clock in New York City, we're already laughing, this is The Five.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump saying he never directed his former personal attorney Michael Cohen to break the law, the exclusive Fox News interview in just a moment. But first, in the wake of all the Mueller probe development, Democrats continue to beat the impeachment drum and predict the president's demise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CONG. MAXINE WATERS (D), CALIFORNIA: I believe that this president is dangerous. I think he has undermined our democracy. I think he's aligned himself with the enemy, with Putin. He loves dictators. And I believe that he certainly qualifies for impeachment. We may never get it done. And maybe Democrats fear that somehow if we move to impeach him, maybe his base will grow larger. I don't think so.</p><p>CONG. DENNY HECK (D), WASHINGTON: I'm prepared to say something I've never said. The writing is on the wall. The walls are closing in, and this is the beginning of the end for the Trump administration.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: This comes as Trump defends himself against accusations of any wrongdoing with Michael Cohen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I've never directed him to do anything incorrect or wrong. And he understands that. Look, he did some bad things unrelated to me, may be related to his other clients. I wasn't his only client. Number one, they say it's not a campaign finance violation. Number two -- or it's not even under campaign finance. Number two, if it was, it's not even a violation. Number three, it's a civil matter. You know, President Obama had a really big one from ten times more money, much more money. And you know what, he paid a fine. I'm the only one that this happened too. So what happened is either Cohen or the prosecutors, in order to embarrass me, said listen, I'm making this deal for reduced time and everything else. Do me a favor, put these two charges in. They're not criminal charges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: All right. So we're going to take it around the table. The thing is, Emily, let's start with you. Democratic political elites, the establishment, they know the political perils of going for impeachment. But the base, they really want President Trump to be impeach. So they're kind of between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, FOX NEWS HOST: That's true. I also think that -- what I don't understand is how you can reconcile that. There's just a few things about impeachment that I feel like should be part of the conversation, so one of them being the amount of time and effort and cost that it takes. To what end? When we all know that there would be an acquittal in the senate. And secondly, the call today from Representative Schiff about, oh, we should amend or make an exception to the office of legal counsel's decision. I read that decision. And that affirms a 1973 decision, and that calls up -- and that calls up president, literally, going back to The Federalist papers. Including --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: And Clinton v. Jones. And so, to me, the greater travesties is that we're having legislators call for that kind of influence on the DOJ. When isn't the entire conversation this whole time and all of their shouting about separations of powers? So that level of influence to me and that kind of vendetta and wasting my taxpayer dollars for that reason, that's what's unacceptable.</p><p>PERINO: I like the hand gestures. Very good. Bring more of it. Juan, what do you think is going to happen between this push and pull? I mean, it's like the base is like pushing forward. They want this impeachment. And you've got people like Nancy Pelosi, like let's just tap the brakes on that, but can she withhold those forces?</p><p>JUAN WILLIAMS, THE FIVE CO-HOST: Oh, yeah. I mean, I just don't think this is very realistic at this point. People like Steny Hoyer who's the number two say, listen, just wait on Mueller. Let's see what he has. Let see what comes. But if you're talking about the American people, a lot of the American people think that what's been going on is pretty outrageous and they worry about it, not only in terms of what one congressman, Heck, of Washington, we show him at the start of the show, said there'd been 36 - - 36 people had been indicted. Three people now, prison terms. You start to think, what is going on with the President of the United States? Why is he so friendly with Putin? You know, is this a distraction?</p><p>Even for Republicans, Dana, I think you see Republicans starting to say, hmm, I don't know about that. I don't know about the wall, et cetera. But I think the key today was how President Trump is just so -- so widly trying to distance himself from people who get in trouble, specifically Michael Cohen. He says, oh -- remember, a long time ago he said, I didn't know anything about these payments. No payment was made. Then we've had Giuliani said, yes, the payment was made and Trump repaid Cohen. And now you hear Trump saying, oh, you know, he's a low level employee. I don't even think he was a lawyer. I think he was a P.R. guy.</p><p>PERINO: P.R. people are really important, by the way.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yeah. But a day ago he said lawyers should know, and he's described Cohen as a lawyer who should know if he was making legal payments. Now he's a P.R. guy.</p><p>PERINO: But, Jesse, let's take a look real quick at something else that happened during the interview today. I think you might be interested in this little thing that the president said? We have that?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I just see this on the front page of the Wall Street Journal which just came out. Look. Trump didn't violate campaign finance laws and neither did the President Trump ex-aid. So they're saying that --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, wait, I interviewed him on my program the other day. That's Hans Von Spakovsky. Yes --</p><p>TRUMP: He's another one. Michael Cohen pled guilty to something that's not even a crime.</p><p>PERINO: You know that guy, Hans Von Spakovsky, HVS.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: HVS. I have the sheet right here. I'm bringing it to every single Five until this thing is concluded. I'm going to make Juan read it. Juan, this is your homework, take off my hands --</p><p>WILLIAMS: Thank you.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm going to test you tomorrow on it, all right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's a deal.</p><p>WATTERS: So, yes, obviously, the FEC -- I'm not even going to bore you with it because it's very granular. A lot of people that know a lot about campaign finance law do not believe this payment violated any law whatsoever.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What about the prosecutors?</p><p>WATTERS: Which prosecutors?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, I think the New York southern district of New York, apparently, think --</p><p>WATTERS: Some of the partisan prosecutors. They're trying to link the president with the other crimes that Cohen committed regarding taxes, and that what -- most of the sentence. The harassment thing I think the Democrats are playing with fire and here's why. Remember what happened with Kavanaugh? So there was so much injustice with Kavanaugh, and so much unfairness, and it was so out-of-bounds, and it really activated the Republican base. And if the Republicans going into 2020 see partisan prosecutors, and Maxine and her bandits going after this president, and a lot of, kind of, shadowy people within the government trying to take away a Democratically elected president from our republic, people are going to feel robbed. And if people feel like their votes are being robbed, they're going to turn out so heavily and there's going to be so much backlash against this president, it's going to be astronomical. Another form of harassment now, Leticia James, I believe like she's the local A.G. here in New York City --</p><p>WILLIAMS: State.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah, state. She just elected. She says I'm going to investigate Trump Tower. I'm going to investigate the Trump company. I'm going to investigate the Trump foundation. What crime is she investigating? She's just investigating everything that says T-R-U-M-P regardless of whether there's a crime. That's not how prosecutors, that's not how attorney generals are supposed to operate. That's outside the law.</p><p>PERINO: All right, Greg, we've covered a lot of ground so far, but we've got to get your take --</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, FOX NEWS HOST: Yeah. First of all, Juan is not correct. America doesn't care about what's going on in this. Collusion when it's polled, always polls the lowest in terms of concern. America doesn't care about people like Cohen. These people just happen to be on the periphery. What they care about is the economy, jobs, their family, which means national security, safety, and law enforcement, how to protect this country. They don't care about this stuff. The same way they didn't care when they went after Bill Clinton. And what did the impeachment proceedings do to Bill Clinton? It made America love him more because America loves a bad boy. If Trump faces impeachment, he becomes an orange fonzie. He'll become a orange fonzie. I have a compromise, though, for the people who want impeachment. Just make -- ask Trump to work half as much, OK? Because you want him gone because he just works too hard. So why doesn't he just work half as much? Because one Trump days is really seven days in Democrat days. So that is why the media and why the Democrats look so exhausted is because he's working them into the ground. So the compromise is, is to just ask Donald Trump don't work so much.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, that's not so hard. He's taking a 16-day Christmas holiday.</p><p>GUTFELD: Good for him. He does five things in a day when presidents usually get around to one. But they can't -- here's the thing, impeach him, what do you get? You get Pence. Pence is so conservative, he once paid off a woman after he shook her hand.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: So you're going to trade in Mr. Right, you're going to get Mr. Even More Right. But anyway, it's just stupid. This is such a travesty. We spent so much time on this stupid story.</p><p>PERINO: OK, well, that was my block.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: President Trump defiant in his plan to get funding for the wall, the latest on the border battle up next.</p><p>WILLIAMS: President Trump not backing down in his fight over the border wall. The president insisting Mexico will pay for it through the new U.S.- Mexico-Canada trade agreement. Democrats on the other hand, they're not budging as a potential government shutdown looms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I want to be crystal clear. There will be no additional appropriations to pay for the border wall.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We should not be wasting $5 billion or, in fact, a lot more than that which is what Trump eventually wants on a wall.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't envision any circumstance where we allocate $5 billion or anything even close to that. Donald Trump is a performance artist. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are serious legislators.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We're for zero-dollars in border wall funding.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAMS: So, Dana, I'm going to ask you to go inside the thinking here on the Republican side because you see people like John Cornyn, number two in the senate, saying he doesn't understand the strategy. Why would the president say that he's going to be responsible if there's a shutdown. Shelley Moore Capito, West Virginia, says it's a fool's errand to have a shutdown. What do you think?</p><p>PERINO: Well, I think -- they're thinking about their constituents, right? Their constituents are going to say, like, not this again. Don't do this again. But I think that the president is saying -- means this much to me and, you know, they turned the tables on him a little bit. They're going to call it the Trump shutdown and he says fine, I'll take it. I think that's leadership, actually. Like to say -- he believes in it so much. I do wish that he would, actually, give a straight address rather than give so many news interviews. And he never has the time to actually walk through and explain to people, persuade them and say you might disagree with me, but let me explain to you this is why I think it's necessary and this is why I think that we need to take action right now. This is what this money would do. This is why I'm trying to be a good steward of your taxpayer dollars. And then, take it to the congress. Instead, it's become just a partisan fight, unfortunately. But I do think that the public has become a little bit immune to this government by shutdown. It's never really that's serious. They don't it for very long. And it's actually -- I think it's actually a less interesting story than the A-block.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, I agree.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Well, I thought you were going to go on.</p><p>GUTFELD: I have a compromise, you know, in the A-block I had a compromise. Trump works half as much instead of impeachment. Here's another solution that brings Mexico and America together, OK? So Trump keeps saying we're going to build the wall and Mexico is going to pay for it, right? It should be the opposite. Mexico builds the wall and we pay Mexico, because why do people immigrate to the United States?</p><p>PERINO: Jobs.</p><p>GUTFELD: Why do people come to the United States? For jobs, right? That's the number one priority. So export the jobs, because -- many immigrants when they come here, the first job that they have is often the starter hard job, right? They come here and they do the hard work. We say, OK, we'll pay you to do the hard work there. Mexico -- it's economy is made great again because there're thousands and thousands of jobs. So, by getting Mexico to actually build the wall that we pay for, you end up not needing the wall because Mexico is great again.</p><p>PERINO: Save money in the long run.</p><p>GUTFELD: Did you follow that? Because I did.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PERINO: I mean that government shutdown is stupid.</p><p>WATTERS: Dana apologized.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right. All right.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm not going to be a party to that.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That genius -- I would say.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I mean, you knock me out, man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, all right. So, Jesse, save me here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK. So the president says really under the new NAFTA deal, Mexico and, I guess, Canada too would pay for the wall. But didn't he say long ago -- I mean, that Mexico would pay. And now he's making it seem as if, gee, not Mexican taxpayers but American taxpayers who benefit from the new trade deal.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah. I think he's saying if you rectify the auto and steel trade imbalances through the new NAFTA negotiation, you're going to come out on top. And that's what's going to be able to pay for the wall. To Greg's point --</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know she's laughing.</p><p>PERINO: I'm smiling.</p><p>WATTERS: I thought that that was a pretty good answer. Can I stop the presses for a second? Greg has not stopped talking throughout the entire show. Every commercial break -- here's some direct quotes from Greg. Are you ready? Ready? Birds are very territorial. I have bumps all over my head. I'd be a terrible bald person. And I have a better idea than animals are great that's really going to take off. This is the stuff that we're confronted with during the commercial break. How am I supposed to even compose myself?</p><p>COMPAGNO: You just violated the commercial break rule.</p><p>WATTERS: Is that a rule?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm in deep trouble.</p><p>GUTFELD: I do have bumps on my head.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you drinking like espresso?</p><p>GUTFELD: No, no, no, I just had a few Advil.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh.</p><p>GUTFELD: I had a bad night.</p><p>WILLIAMS: A lot of caffeine. So, Emily, let's get back to the topic. It's tough, but let's try. Stephen King says --</p><p>WATTERS: I had some other stuff --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: You can surrender your time. I'll take over. I got you, Jesse.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, did you say --</p><p>WATTERS: Can we talk about the wall tomorrow?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I called you my little comedian.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm just putting words in your mouth.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, thank you. All right. But I mean --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COMPAGNO: I have a lot to say about this. First of all, I think what's the most concerning to me is the fact that this whole conversation about that funding for the wall is totally nebulous. It's not all going towards a physical construction. There's also agents. There's technology. There's a whole host of things. So I feel like it's lazy and misleading for Democrats to harp on whether or not it's green or red light when citizens deserve to understand how that's allocated because for border security and protection, absolutely. What really is the difference between 1.8 billion, which Schumer has expressly approved, and 5 billion when we're throwing 380 million at the states for border security. Take it back. Let them deal with it on their own. Sorry, California sinking ship. Figure it out. Or how much foreign aid we're giving. Or -- what else did I write down? The IRS, 196 million to the IRS to improve customer service?</p><p>WATTERS: Tammy Bruce said this on Hannity the other night, and then Trump stole it from her. She said if we're going to give the Iranians 150 billion, we can't give 5 billion towards border security?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Two hundred people a day die from drug overdoses. Get out of here. Like we're playing with money. And the government shutdown is a threat? I totally disagree with that leverage.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a second, who started this? Trump said Mexico --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, I have another compromise.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, go right ahead.</p><p>GUTFELD: I have another compromise.</p><p>WILLIAMS: OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: Build the wall accordion style. So you have it up half of the year, right? And then the other half of the year, off to the side.</p><p>PERINO: Why?</p><p>GUTFELD: Because then the people who don't want the wall, don't have the wall. And the people -- yeah, it's an accordion wall and you just pull it out. It's almost like joint custody in reverse.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Are you OK today?</p><p>GUTFELD: I am Mr. Compromise.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know what I think, this sounds like one of those New York apartment that young people get where you have the wall --</p><p>GUTFELD: That's where I got the idea.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm telling you. We're having a good time today. A Democratic congressman under fire for suggesting free speech should be regulated? Hear from him next on The Five.</p><p>GUTFELD: I forgot to mention about -- what my wall argument, why Mexico should build it and we pay for it. That way you get around the eminent domain issue which is just going to prevent the wall anyway.</p><p>PERINO: And who cares about their environment?</p><p>GUTFELD: I care. Oh, Dana. You're not invited to my Christmas party.</p><p>PERINO: Oh, are you having a Christmas party?</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm not telling.</p><p>PERINO: Oh.</p><p>GUTFELD: Last night, Ted Lieu, a Democratic congressman from, spoiler alert, California, said if he could, he'd restrict speech. You know, I believe him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONG. TED LIEU (D), CALIFORNIA: I would love to be able to regulate the content of speech. The first amendment prevents me from doing so. And that's simply a function of the first amendment, but I think over the long run, it's better that government does not regulate the content of speech.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, how nice of him. Thank you, sir, for giving a thumbs-up for our right to free speech. We were worried there. But here's the thing Ted misses about threats to speech, it's coming from his side. Today, it's the leftists on campus, shrill celebrities, nervous CEO's who seek to stop you from speaking your mind. Worse, they're also punishing you if you don't speak what's on their mind. Use the wrong pronoun, you're toast. Meanwhile, Trump barreling in the opposite direction. He'll say anything. Take Tuesday's meeting, Chancy badly wanted the border wall discussion done in secret.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The point is, is that there're equities to be weighed. And we're here to have a conversation in a careful way, so I don't think we should have a debate in front of the press on this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GUTFELD: Oh, Trump insisted we see the sausage being made. And surprise, the media sided with the pair who wanted to hide the sausage. Funny. Trump's transparency scares the media who pretended for so long to be about uncovering the truth. But that was only if the truth was what they believed. The fact is when it comes to speech, you won't find a better role model than Trump. He won't shut up. And he's revived the dead mainstream media by giving them a simple business plan, bash Trump every day. For eight years, they were as frozen as boardwalk bananas, and Trump finally thaw them out.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Why are you picking on Pence? So what if he was frozen?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: You know what, he was like me on the subway when something's going down on the subway and you don't want to make eye contact, you're just like this.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Emily, I want you to use as much hand gestures as you can when I ask you, isn't speech under threat really on campuses and in companies? And it's not coming from Republicans.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Absolutely. And, yes --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm going to sit on my hands for this and we'll see if I, kind of like, stay here. Yeah, I mean, as evidenced by the fact that UC Berkeley was made to pay the huge settlement. And I want to point out something about Ted Lieu, he just gets under my skin so much. This guy -- 20,000 tweets? I'm sure he would be the last person that want to be censored. And I looked up his record, you guys, he's missed 9.6 percent of votes. That's a huge percentage when the median is 2.4. So how about this, rep? Why don't you take it your time actually representing your constituents rather than shouting about it on twitter and then trying to censor others? And, you know, he also voted nay on the Patriot Act revision in 2015. So I find that surprising given that, basically, he's against big brother in that regard but then wants to censor others.</p><p>WATTERS: You can use your hands now.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Is it awkward?</p><p>GUTFELD: All right, Jesse, what are your thoughts on that stellar monologue?</p><p>WATTERS: My thought is did someone screen that monologue beforehand?</p><p>PERINO: I did.</p><p>WATTERS: Does anybody ever look that over or do you just have full control?</p><p>PERINO: He asked me.</p><p>GUTFELD: People trust me.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: I thought Jesse was going to interrupt you and say did you really say that he talks too much?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GUTFELD: Obviously, there was an implication that he was saying, you know, I would like to limit speech. Oh, he mentioned Fox News. He would like to limit Fox News.</p><p>WATTERS: Yeah. I mean, he wants to limit the first amendment. They want to limit the second amendment. I remember, this reminds me of President Obama when he kind of let it slip and he goes, yeah, we just want to spread the wealth around. And sometimes liberals say that. Say, yeah, I do want to regulate speech. And that's when the truth comes out. And you're right, they want to regulate on college campuses, the internet. They tell Trump he can't say that, yet he keeps winning. So I don't think what they really wanted is working. What's happening here is if you have 200 years and you have people in this country as politicians, you run out of new legislations. So in order to make yourself useful, and justify your job, you have to say, oh, we've got to pass this bill. We've got to pass this bill. We've got to regulate this. We've got to regulate businesses. After a while, you don't need any more laws. Everything's fine. Leave it alone, rep.</p><p>GUTFELD: Juan, do you agree, no more laws?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No more laws?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: In other words, history is over.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think we thought that back after the Berlin Wall came down, it didn't work, Jesse. But, anyway --</p><p>WATTERS: What are you talking about?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Don't worry about it. We thought history -- I'll explain it to you later. But on this argument --</p><p>WATTERS: Just read the article by Hans.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIAMS: We're back to it. Test me on it.</p><p>But on this argument, what interests me here is, you know, it's futile to say you're going to regulate speech. That's ridiculous.</p><p>GREG GUTFELD, HOST: It's happening.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's not -- well, I -- you know what's interesting? You and I differ on this, because I think it's happening when people say things like pro-life versus pro-choice. Or they say pro guns or Second Amendment rights versus public safety.</p><p>GUTFELD: I agree with you there.</p><p>WILLIAMS: They choose their language.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Or they insist or they say \"identity politics\" versus \"individual rights\" that should be protected for gays, minorities, Jews, whoever. So people choose their language.</p><p>And the question, I think, that he's really interested in comes from the hearings earlier this week with Google.</p><p>GUTFELD: Google.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Remember when Google was there. And they had people like Steve King and others saying, \"Hey, how come when there's a search, it comes up negative for me?\"</p><p>And what did Ted Lieu say? He said, \"If you want to have good search results, do good things.\" And I think a lot of Republicans are angry.</p><p>EMILY COMPAGNO, HOST: Talking about the content versus the question.</p><p>WATTERS: Only Republicans do bad things, Juan?</p><p>WILLIAMS: What?</p><p>WATTERS: Only Republicans do bad things?</p><p>WILLIAMS: No, I think we agree it's Greg today.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes. Dana, in this, I still -- I actually agree with Juan talking about how language can be regulated by the choice of terminology you use.</p><p>But what we're seeing now is we're actually being told that if you don't use certain words, you can get in trouble.</p><p>DANA PERINO, HOST: Right.</p><p>GUTFELD: So if you actually do not agree to using a specific pronoun, you could be in trouble.</p><p>PERINO: You no longer have the right to remain silent.</p><p>GUTFELD: Right.</p><p>PERINO: One thing that's ironic about this: big tech has replaced big banks or big pharma as what the liberals want to go after.</p><p>GUTFELD: And Wall Street.</p><p>PERINO: Well, big banks.</p><p>GUTFELD: Excuse me.</p><p>PERINO: Silicon Valley is mostly liberal, right?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>PERINO: They're almost liberal. Wait till three weeks from now, when the Democrats have subpoena power, they have the gavel, and they are going to go after Silicon Valley, because that's their new target. And so pretty soon, you're going to see a bunch of Silicon Valley people may be rethinking their support.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, or upping the virtue signaling.</p><p>PERINO: That will be exhausting.</p><p>GUTFELD: To save their skin.</p><p>PERINO: We could have -- we have, like, a scale.</p><p>GUTFELD: We could have a scale. Scales are fun.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Not always.</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm going to have one at my Christmas party.</p><p>WILLIAMS: am I allowed to talk about Rudolph's red nose? Or is that -- is that bad?</p><p>GUTFELD: It is bad.</p><p>WILLIAMS: It's bad, OK.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's bad. He had a drinking problem.</p><p>A liberal pundit lashing out at Melania Trump for daring to call out the media. The video ahead.</p><p>COMPAGNO: First lady Melania Trump calling out the, quote, \"opportunists\" in the media during a sit-down with Sean Hannity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN HANNITY, FOX NEWS HOST: What's been the hardest thing that you have to deal with?</p><p>MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES: I would say the opportunists who are using my name or my family name to advance themselves, from comedians to journalists to performers, book writers.</p><p>HANNITY: Does it hurt?</p><p>TRUMP: It doesn't hurt. The problem is they are writing the history. And it's not correct.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: After the interview, a CNN contributor attacking the first lady for what she says is complaining.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOAN WALSH, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: She continues to whine about a situation that she's part of, and it's a great honor to be first lady. And I'm sure privately, you're allowed to grouse, but you know, if Michelle Obama had done half the complaining that she has done in her -- in her limited interviews -- She doesn't do many -- she'd be skewered.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>COMPAGNO: Dana, I want to start with you. Your lens and perspective from the different administrations.</p><p>PERINO: Well, I give a ton of leeway to all first ladies. And then, in the future, first gentleman.</p><p>WATTERS: That sounds like a fun job.</p><p>PERINO: They didn't get elected, right, but they serve. And also, you know, you serve and you do a lot of work; and you don't get paid for it.</p><p>She does limited interviews, because she actually doesn't have -- she doesn't bring a lot of attention on herself. But she is an amazing person. You saw her with the children at Toys for Tots this week with the Marines. She loved it. She was with the military yesterday, and then she did the interview with Sean.</p><p>But I have to say that I don't know of any first lady who didn't complain about press coverage, especially when it's usually targeted at themselves or at their husbands. You read any of their autobiographies after they leave the White House, all of them say the same thing.</p><p>So I think that Joan Walsh's complaints about complaining are misplaced.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Greg --</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>COMPAGNO: -- what are your thoughts as to people who say that her role is maybe archaic, but she doesn't do it well?</p><p>PERINO: Who says that?</p><p>COMPAGNO: What would you say to those who say that these things that she has to do, they should be modernized? And maybe she's just simply not good at domestication and decorating a hallway with Christmas trees.</p><p>GUTFELD: I would tell them to stuff it. You know what? The people meanest to the first lady happen to be women. Have you noticed that?</p><p>PERINO: Always, yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Joan Walsh. It's very interesting that feminists are all about leaning in -- #MeToo, you go, girl -- until you disagree with them. And then they're -- they're as chauvinistic and sexist as the next guy.</p><p>PERINO: It's not that they -- they don't even disagree with her. They just don't like her husband.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes, it's called Trump hate spillover. It hits everybody that's in his circle.</p><p>Because she's kept a lower profile than Amelia Earhart. Let's face it. She's not out there, but they go after her.</p><p>And I said this before. Imagine if your spouse ran for president in a foreign country and won; and now I became the first lady, you became the first lady. I's a job you didn't really sign up for. That's what happened to her.</p><p>PERINO: Yes.</p><p>GUTFELD: Previous first ladies, the people married to Clinton and to Bush and to Obama, they -- they didn't sign up for it, but they knew it was possible. Because -- because there was politics in two families. And with Obama, he was political.</p><p>PERINO: The Clintons -- the Clintons were at college planning it.</p><p>GUTFELD: Exactly, so they were ready for it. She had no idea --</p><p>PERINO: No.</p><p>GUTFELD: -- this was going to be in her life and she's doing a damn good job.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You know, I was trying to think about, what is she -- what is it that happened to her? And I thought to myself, I remember people said she was slow to go to Washington. Then everybody said, but that's because of your child in schools, right? That made sense.</p><p>But then she wore that jacket, Greg. Remember the jacket: \"I don't care,\" whatever it said on the back. I think that was --</p><p>GUTFELD: It's fashion. I own one, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Oh, you do have one?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I think they sold out, wherever they were selling.</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: But then -- and then her parents were chain migrants. They came, and people said, \"Well, that's a contradiction. The president's so down on chain migration.\" But then Michael Wolff says --</p><p>GUTFELD: Why is this her problem?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Because this is what I think she could be complaining about specifically. Like, put a name to the problem. And then Michael Wolff said she cried in his book. He said she cried on the night of the election, because she didn't want it. And I think Bob Woodward said this couple has --</p><p>GUTFELD: A lot of people cried, Juan. A lot of Democrats.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, I was going to say, that was me. It was me.</p><p>GUTFELD: But you know what? These are little things, and there's no big thing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying.</p><p>GUTFELD: You need a lot of little things.</p><p>WILLIAMS: What is the big thing? What is she complaining about then?</p><p>WATTERS: I could name a few, Juan.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Go ahead.</p><p>WATTERS: I mean, she was portrayed as a stripper. She's been called a hostage. She's -- her decorations have been ridiculed every single year during Christmas. You know, her fashion style, her accent. You know, she's been ridiculed on a number of levels. I think after a while, that builds up.</p><p>I just want to tip my hat to her. It was very brave to go on Sean Hannity's show for her. That was -- you know, it took a lot of courage. I thought she handled it really well.</p><p>Listen, I think what's really going on is that she is an immigrant, and she didn't grow up in this country. She's a private person. She wants to take care of her son, first and foremost.</p><p>And she's not -- listen, she's not going to go out there to the wall and say, \"Build the wall\" like Hillary did, like Hillary care. She's not into the policy the way Hillary Clinton was. So she's just going to lay back, doing her thing. And she doesn't expect incoming to the level that she's getting it right now. No other first ladies were treated with the same type of vitriol.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I will say this, too, that I think this was an incredibly lost opportunity by the press corps and by everyone who's attacked her for generosity. And I don't mean that in a Pollyanna way. But I mean that in a way that, if she -- if they automatically lumped her in with the office of the presidency and hated and loathed the man serving in an office, then use her as a conduit. Build her up. Get in her ear so that that can help sway policy or sway some type of messaging. Rather than, again, lumping her in and subjecting her to this -- this --</p><p>PERINO: It's also just a weird choice to do, to basically pick apart a first lady's interview.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's the -- coming up, I have a big surprise.</p><p>PERINO: OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: An office email chain goes horribly wrong. And would you give up your smartphone for 100 grand before taxes? That and more in \"The Fastest Seven,\" up next.</p><p>(MUSIC: LED ZEPPELIN)</p><p>WATTERS: There's some music right there. Welcome back. Time for \"The Fastest Seven.\"</p><p>First up, it's a reply-all apocalypse. Yes, I said that. A holiday potluck email descends into chaos after it was accidentally sent to over 20,000 Utah government employees, including the lieutenant governor. For hours, people's inboxes were clogged up with angry responses, demanding to be taken off the thread.</p><p>Greg, you --</p><p>PERINO: How made would you be?</p><p>WATTERS: -- how do you handle, like, group chain emails that kind of get out of hand? What's your move?</p><p>GUTFELD: I actually send a really gruesome picture.</p><p>WATTERS: And that just ends it?</p><p>GUTFELD: That ends the whole -- but you know what? This is not a bad story, because that person who sent that is thanking their lucky stars that's just a potluck email. Think about what you could've sent by accident. Imagine if it was, like, an email to a lover.</p><p>WATTERS: Imagine.</p><p>GUTFELD: Imagine what could accidentally go out. I mean, this is like, thank God. If you want an accident, this is the kind of accident you want.</p><p>PERINO: That's true.</p><p>WATTERS: Do you reply all? Are you a big reply all person?</p><p>PERINO: I'm not really -- for efficiency, yes. Like, if you need -- everybody needs to be on the same page or something, yes. But when it's like, a reply all because it's somebody's birthday, I don't reply all on the birthdays. I don't do it.</p><p>WATTERS: You just go in for the solo?</p><p>PERINO: Absolutely.</p><p>WATTERS: Juan, do you use email?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Once a month. But -- but I think for us --</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: -- isn't Greg the guy who does the chain e-mail?</p><p>GUTFELD: Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, yes.</p><p>WILLIAMS: I'm listening, and I'm thinking --</p><p>WATTERS: That's true. Now that I think about it, you are big into reply all.</p><p>PERINO: When we were lost one time, and you are asking directions and you were replying to all of us. And we were like, we're not even with you. And you were like, \"Which way should I tell the driver to go?\" Do you remember that?</p><p>GUTFELD: No.</p><p>PERINO: Does anyone remember that?</p><p>GUTFELD: The Hofstra debate.</p><p>WATTERS: All right.</p><p>GUTFELD: Who could forget the Hofstra debate, huh?</p><p>COMPAGNO: Remember when you replied all and said \"Emily who?\" to me? That was awesome. Great joke. That made me feel really good.</p><p>WATTERS: Were you joking or were you serious?</p><p>COMPAGNO: He was joking. He was joking. It was, like, two weeks ago. You never even responded.</p><p>OK, this is how I feel about it. As a former federal employee, I would get accidental emails like that all the time. And it is so first grade. Because the entire government freaks out, and everyone gloms on and says, like, \"Take me off!\" And it's so ridiculous. And we're admonished you're not even to say, \"Thank you\" because of the amount -- it diminishes, like, 35,000 emails a day if you're not allowed to say thank you. So the whole thing is just ridiculous. Like, an accident is fine, but everyone jumping in, like, way to waste my money.</p><p>WATTERS: Ridiculous.</p><p>All right. Up next, heading to grandma's house for Christmas this year, consider passing the time with a song.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHEVY CHASE, ACTOR/COMEDIAN (SINGING): Deck the halls with boughs of holly. Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la. Tis the season to be jolly. Fa-la- la-la-la, la-la-la-la.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: According to a new study, two-thirds of families driving long distances for holidays frequently sing together. Their favorite tune? \"Jingle Bell Rock\" followed by \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town,\" \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,\" and \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas.\" Oh, man.</p><p>PERINO: I used to go with \"The First Noel.\"</p><p>WATTERS (SINGING): The first Noel --</p><p>(SPEAKING): OK, Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirty Cheap,\" and can we put a moratorium on \"Christmas Vacation\" videos, please?</p><p>WATTERS: The producers taking a lot of heat today. I, for one, stand with the producers.</p><p>Juan, what do you think? Do you sing in the car?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Yes, but I sing to myself. Because if anybody else was in the car, they'd object. You know?</p><p>WATTERS: It's true. You have a horrible voice.</p><p>WILLIAMS: There you go.</p><p>WATTERS: Mine's worse. Don't worry.</p><p>COMPAGNO: On the way here, on the flight here, when I walked in, it was, like, 5 a.m., and the flight attendant was humming along to \"Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.\" And I was literally, like, \"No thank you.\" Like, six hours, to get it in my head? No thanks.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Wait a minute, have you heard \"Animals Are Great.\"</p><p>WATTERS: He doesn't hum.</p><p>COMPAGNO: True, true.</p><p>WATTERS: And finally, how much would it take for you to give up your smartphone for one whole year? Vitamin Water is offering one cell phone addict 100 grand to trade in their iPhone for Android for a 1990s era flip phone. I've had one of those. Those are good. But only if they can make it a full 365 days without using a mobile device.</p><p>Can anybody at the table --</p><p>PERINO: There's got to be a catch. I feel like there's a catch.</p><p>WATTERS: Let's pretend there's not a catch.</p><p>COMPAGNO: They're doing a lie detector test. Vitamin Water, it says it. They're doing a lie detector.</p><p>WATTERS: I know how to beat those. All right.</p><p>PERINO: I can't do that. I work.</p><p>GUTFELD: This is a great P.R. idea, because they're going to get $100,000 in free advertising from shows like this.</p><p>But it gave me an idea, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: OK.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Here we go.</p><p>GUTFELD: This is a big idea, America. And this is going to take up -- I am challenging you, Dana.</p><p>PERINO: Me?</p><p>GUTFELD: I will give you $5,000 to your favorite animal charity if from this day, December 13, 2018, to December 13, 2019, you cannot mention Jasper's name on \"The Five.\" If you can do that for one year, $5,000 to your favorite animal charity.</p><p>PERINO: You don't understand what the fans want. The fans want Jasper.</p><p>GUTFELD: She's turning down $5,000 to an animal charity!</p><p>PERINO: That's so cheap. They're offering $100,000.</p><p>WATTERS: You know what?</p><p>GUTFELD: I'm not a corporation.</p><p>WATTERS: I'm throwing in 5,000 too. Williams, are you in?</p><p>GUTFELD: Ten thousand dollars.</p><p>COMPAGNO: Five thousand to keep talking about Jasper.</p><p>GUTFELD: That doesn't make any sense! She's going to do it anyway.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I'm sorry.</p><p>GUTFELD: You just lost my (UNINTELLIGIBLE). She's going to keep talking about it.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I have on her side.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, \"One More Thing\" is up next. Thank God.</p><p>PERINO: All right. It's time now for \"One More Thing.\" I'm going to go first. I want to pay tribute to somebody that I've admired for so long. Senator Orrin Hatch. He is retiring at the end of this Congress. And he gave a speech yesterday at the end of the year here as the Congress comes to a close. And he's been a great patriot, a very thoughtful person. He's super funny, and he's just done a lot for Utah and for the United States.</p><p>GUTFELD: Wrote a -- didn't he write country music?</p><p>PERINO: Country music. He has a beautiful singing voice. So he's been really wonderful. In his farewell address, the senator asked the nation that we listen to our better angels. He also has a great Twitter game. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(ORRIN HATCH EATING BACON)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERINO: Remember when the vegans wanted us to not say say, \"Bring home the bacon\" anymore? That was his response.</p><p>I hope that you keep tweeting, sir, and thank you for your service.</p><p>Greg.</p><p>GUTFELD: All right. It's time for --</p><p>GRAPHIC: Greg's Disgusting News</p><p>GUTFELD: \"Greg's Disgusting News.\" Now, if you have any children in your -- in your seated area, or maybe elderly, I would push them out of the room. Because this is disgusting.</p><p>Take a look at this. We unearthed this video of a dog getting a haircut. I don't know about you, but it's making me sick to my stomach.</p><p>PERINO: That's disgusting.</p><p>GUTFELD: It is absolutely one of the most disgusting pictures I've ever seen. Look at that adorable beast getting his hair clipped. Look how happy he is.</p><p>COMPAGNO: I want that in a -- this morning.</p><p>PERINO: It is pretty cute.</p><p>GUTFELD: That's disgusting!</p><p>PERINO: All right, Jesse. You're next.</p><p>WATTERS: What happened to \"Animals Are Great\"?</p><p>GUTFELD: I took -- I gave it a little break so people would ask about it!</p><p>WATTERS: I fell right into the trap!</p><p>All right. So -- so each of the hosts around the table are assigned a producer to basically make them look good during the show.</p><p>PERINO: That's true.</p><p>GUTFELD: What happened to you?</p><p>WATTERS: Ouch, that's not an insult to me. That's an insult to Michael Demarco (ph). He's my producer. He does an excellent job. There he is there staring at the camera in kind of a bizarre way. He's a sharp dresser, great haircut. You know, the kid has really learned a lot about great hair from the master. There he is.</p><p>PERINO: That looks like a mug shot.</p><p>WATTERS: What do they say? I honestly think flattery is -- what is it?</p><p>PERINO: Imitation.</p><p>WATTERS: Imitation is the best form of flattery. So what I want people to do is go on -- why is his face so mysterious? Go on the FOX Instagram page.</p><p>GUTFELD: It's actually (UNINTELLIGIBLE)</p><p>WATTERS: On \"The Five's\" Instagram page. Because I'm making a brilliant point to Juan. And vote, who has the better hair?</p><p>You know, it's funny, I asked him to give me a bio about himself. This is what he said: \"32, lives on the Jersey Shore, used to work for Dobbs.\" What a bio! I love it. Demarco's (ph) the man.</p><p>PERINO: He's young. He's young. He's got a lot more to add in the future.</p><p>GUTFELD: Working for Dobbs. Aren't we all?</p><p>WATTERS: Dobbs to Watters. There's a trajectory.</p><p>WILLIAMS: All right, here we go. So you --</p><p>PERINO: Juan's got ten points.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You've heard about the war on Christmas. What about the war on Christmas decorations? Take a look at this sign over the Holland Tunnel, connecting New York and New Jersey. As you can see, someone put a triangular Christmas tree over the \"N\" and a circular wreath over the \"U.\"</p><p>That upset one commuter. He said it made him itch with anxiety. And he started a petition to change it and noted as many as 3 percent of Americans are obsessive compulsive, and this could trigger their compulsion.</p><p>GUTFELD: Amazing.</p><p>WILLIAMS: Now he's getting support.</p><p>Look at this. Yes. The Budweiser brewery, not far from the tunnel, says they're going to misspell their brand name until the Christmas decorations at the tunnel are corrected. One supporter tweeted, \"Bud, that's why you're truly the King of beers.\"</p><p>PERINO: This Bud's for you. All right.</p><p>COMPAGNO: As a visually OCD person, I appreciate that.</p><p>PERINO: Emily, use as many hand gestures as you want.</p><p>COMPAGNO: All right. Thanksgiving may be over, but one turkey is still the center of attention.</p><p>A wild bird was caught on camera chasing down a Wisconsin boy who was walking home from school. Quickly, a sympathetic driver pulled over in between the boy and the turkey, stopping the bird in its tracks.</p><p>Apparently, he's -- this is the funniest part. The turkey is known to be a terror around town, and residents have dubbed him the unofficial mayor of the town. I think this is so funny, because my dog used to, when she was younger, my 100-pound Doberman, used to chase anything that was running, including small kids.</p><p>PERINO: That's not funny. That's terrible. If you're the kid. It's terrible! What are you talking about, Emily? Oh, my gosh.</p><p>I thought you were nice. We'll discuss in the break. \"Special Report\" is next.</p><p>Hey, Bret.</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Animals are great.

A progressive agenda that stands for all, is the way we transform this country.\u201d</p><p>Warren: \u201cLook, people across this country, whether they are Democrats, independents or Republicans, they know what\u2019s broken. They know that we have an America, that\u2019s working better and better and better, for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top. And leaving everyone else behind.\u201d</p><p>Biden: \u201cWe have to unite the country, because folks it\u2019s time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We\u2019re in a better position than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for God\u2019s sake, get up. Get up and remember this is the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing we\u2019re unable to do, when we decide we\u2019re going to do it. Nothing at all.\u201d</p><p>Democrats debate who is best to take on Trump</p><p>The entire Democratic argument was distilled into a five-minute discussion with Joe Biden on one side and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren on the other. Mr. Biden, as he has done since his campaign began, argued that his history of working with Republicans would make him more palatable to independents and some Republicans while at the same time offering an implicit argument that his more doctrinaire opponents would hand a second term to Mr. Trump.</p><p>At the same time, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren pitched themselves as capable of expanding the Democratic electorate by exciting voters about bolder proposals. \u201cFor me,\u201d Ms. Warren said, \u201cthis is about knowing what\u2019s broken, knowing how to fix it and yes, I\u2019m willing to go out there and fight for it.\u201d Her implication, of course, is that Mr. Biden doesn\u2019t know any of those things.</p><p>Biggest moment of the night? Biden vs. Sanders and Warren</p><p>One of the debate\u2019s closing segments brought a clear example of the two poles in the party: Joe Biden vs Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>After touting himself as \u201cthe only one on this stage who has gotten anything really big done,\u201d Mr. Biden slammed both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders as offering \u201cvague\u201d ideas. Pushing a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d overhaul as they do, Mr. Biden said, \u201crequires you not be vague. Tell people how you\u2019re going to get it done.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren followed by reciting her history of envisioning and then creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Mr. Biden sought to claim credit for that too.</p><p>\u201cI went on the floor and I got votes for that bill, I convinced people to vote for that,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s get that straight.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren paused, and speaking slowly, said, \u201cI am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law,\u201d specifically not giving credit to Mr. Biden.</p><p>Biden, Buttigieg spar on expanding the Supreme Court</p><p>As conservatives have taken a decisive majority on the Supreme Court, Democrats publicly grappled with the idea of expanding the court to take back power.</p><p>Mr. Biden said he was against adding additional justices to the Supreme Court, calling it \u201ccourt packing,\u201d worried about the trust in the institution itself.</p><p>\u201cWe begin to lose any credibility the court has at all,\u201d Mr. Biden said.</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg, who has floated multiple options to expand the high court to as many as 15 justices \u2014 an idea, he acknowledged, was attacked as \u201ctoo bold to even contemplate\u201d \u2014 said that he wanted to depoliticize the court.</p><p>Now, he said \u201cwe have this apocalyptical ideological firefight\u201d with every vacancy.</p><p>Ms. Warren said she was open to expanding the court \u2014 but stopped short of embracing it outright.</p><p>Democrats tackle questions about abortion</p><p>Finally, there came a question on abortion.</p><p>Ms. Harris said she\u2019d require Justice Department pre-clearance for any state laws restricting abortion access. Ms. Klobuchar asked viewers to imagine her onstage debating abortion rights with Mr. Trump. And then Mr. Booker said he\u2019d create an \u201coffice of reproductive rights\u201d in the White House.</p><p>There\u2019s little disagreement among the Democratic candidates on abortion rights, it\u2019s more a matter of degree to which.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard said she\u2019d prohibit third trimester abortions, a position that puts her nearly alone among candidates who have stressed that decisions about ending a pregnancy should be left to women and their doctors.</p><p>Harris hits Warren hard over Trump and Twitter</p><p>Ms. Harris, who had refrained from attacking her opponents for the debate\u2019s first two hours, asked Ms. Warren why she did not call for Twitter to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account.</p><p>\u201cSenator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump\u2019s account, that you did not agree,\u201d Ms. Harris said.</p><p>Ms. Warren shot back, \u201cI don\u2019t just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter, I want to push him out of the White House.\u201d She did not say whether Twitter should indeed suspend the president from its platform.</p><p>Ms. Harris got another shot, and again pressed Ms. Warren. Ms. Warren once again did not take the bait and dodged the question.</p><p>Warren pitches breaking up Big Tech</p><p>Throughout the primary, Ms. Warren has led the field in her aggressive stance to break up big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook and she did so again on Tuesday.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy,\u201d she said.</p><p>Ms. Warren walked through Amazon\u2019s role as a product marketplace and product seller.</p><p>\u201cYou get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team. You don\u2019t get to be both at the same time,\u201d she said.</p><p>While her Democratic rivals do want to go as far, most agree with the sentiment. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said they should not call out particular companies. Mr. Yang said breaking up companies would not solve problems, rattling off a joke that grew broad laughs. </p><p>\u201cThere is a reason why no one is using Bing today,\u201d he said. \u201cSorry Microsoft.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Booker, meanwhile, called for \u201cregulation and reform,\u201d while acknowledging that tech companies represent a \u201cmassive problem in our democracy.\u201d</p><p>Sanders says he\u2019s healthy and will mount a \u2018vigorous\u2019 campaign</p><p>As the debate approached the end of the second hour, Bernie Sanders was asked directly to reassure the American people about his health two weeks after a heart attack. But before the moderator Erin Burnett could get the question out, Mr. Sanders delivered his answer. \u201cI\u2019m healthy, I\u2019m feeling great,\u201d he said. </p><p>Cory Booker interjected with a joke that Mr. Sanders also supports medical marijuana.\u201d </p><p>I\u2019m not on it tonight,\u201d Mr. Sanders retorted.</p><p>When Ms. Burnett then asked the question, Mr. Sanders invited people to his rally this weekend in New York. \u201cWe are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people,\u201d he said, thanking his rivals for their \u201clove\u201d and \u201cprayers.\u201d </p><p>\u201cI just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I\u2019m so happy to be back here with you this evening,\u201d he said to applause.</p><p>Opioid discussion shows challenge for candidates</p><p>The opioid discussion that just took place is a good exhibit of why some of the most vexing issues facing the presidential candidates is so difficult as a debate topic.</p><p>Amy Klobuchar and Tom Steyer each bemoaned prescription drug companies for pushing prescription opioids on Americans to enrich themselves, but didn\u2019t reveal much contrast between themselves or their onstage opponents, or even Mr. Trump.</p><p>Yet this is a topic that hits home for millions of Americans and one that candidates are asked about frequently on the campaign trail. It\u2019s a serious problem without easily digestible solutions. </p><p>There\u2019s a lot of agreement onstage, with little understanding of what, exactly any of the candidates would do.</p><p>O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg spar in tense exchange over mandatory assault weapon buybacks</p><p>Beto O\u2019Rourke and Pete Buttigieg sparred aggressively over guns in an intense and personal exchange. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has called for the mandatory buyback of assault weapons by the government. Mr. Buttigieg has called that unrealistic and a plan that damages the Democratic Party.</p><p>\u201cIf the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cEvery single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.\u201d</p><p>But Mr. O\u2019Rourke struggled to say how he would handle taking the guns from Americans who do not want to give up those weapons. \u201cCongressman, you just made it clear that you don\u2019t know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait, we can\u2019t wait for universal background checks.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe cannot wait for purity tests,\u201d he concluded, \u201cWe just have to get something done.\u201d</p><p>After Mr. O\u2019Rourke said it was time to stop listening to polls and be bold, Mr. Buttigieg jumped back in. \u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, saying the real problem was the National Rifle Association, whom they should unite against. He said Democrats could conceivably ban assault weapons and not get \u201cwrapped around the axle\u201d of mandatory buybacks.</p><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not going door to door, it\u2019s not mandatory,\u201d Mr. Castro said, opposing the plan, noting that in many communities the idea of police knocking on doors has also led to violence.</p><p>Biden challenges Trump on foreign policy</p><p>Joe Biden tried once again to present himself as the person onstage with the most direct foreign policy experience.</p><p>\u201cI may be the only person who has spent extensive time alone with Putin and Erdogan,\u201d he said, referring to the Russian and Turkish leaders.</p><p>During two opportunities to discuss the current situation in Syrian, Mr. Biden didn\u2019t exactly say whether he\u2019d send additional American troops to quell the fighting along the Syria-Turkey border, but blamed Mr. Trump for inflaming a tense situation.</p><p>\u201cWe have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates under his own fear for re-election,\u201d he said.</p><p>Democrat after Democrat piled onto Mr. Trump on international affairs.</p><p>\u201cThis president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire,\u201d Senator Cory Booker said.</p><p>\u201cThis president is caging kids on the border and letting ISIS prisoners run free,\u201d added Juli\u00e1n Castro.</p><p>Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke, Klobuchar repeatedly target Warren</p><p>Pete Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke and Amy Klobuchar, three candidates who sorely need to boost themselves in the polls, have adopted the same strategy tonight: Go after Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>All three sought to contrast themselves and their plans with Ms. Warren, with Mr. O\u2019Rourke arguing the Massachusetts senator is \u201cmore interested in being punitive\u201d than offering a positive vision. Ms. Klobuchar has twice offered \u201ca reality check to Elizabeth.\u201d And Mr. Buttigieg scolded her for not saying whether her health care plan will raise middle class taxes.</p><p>Ms. Warren, a polling co-leader with Mr. Biden, serves a useful foil for the three aiming to occupy the party\u2019s moderate lane. Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. O\u2019Rourke are in danger of missing next month\u2019s debate, while Mr. Buttigieg is trying to lift himself into the field of front-runners.</p><p>By contrast, there were few attacks on Mr. Biden, who took much of the incoming fire from rivals in the past debates. Going after Ms. Warren lets the would-be moderate standard-bearers avoid a contrast with Mr. Biden, particularly on the Ukraine issue where he has become vulnerable. Attacking Ms. Warren serves as a rehearsal for the party\u2019s moderate voters of how the candidates would fare against her in a presumed one-on-one matchup much later in the primary process.</p><p>It also shows which of the liberal candidate is feared most by the moderates. It\u2019s no longer Bernie Sanders, it is only Ms. Warren.</p><p>Cory Booker and Kamala Harris seek uplift by avoiding the fray</p><p>Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris both came into the debate struggling for support and attention. And it was apparent by the end of the first hour that they had adopted a similar game plan: seeking to rise about the fray and food fight unfolding around them.</p><p>\u201cTearing each other down because we have a different plan is unacceptable,\u201d Mr. Booker said at one point, saying Democratic infighting would be \u201ca disaster for us.\u201d</p><p>Earlier, Mr. Booker had been the first candidate to castigate the media for asking Mr. Biden questions about his son\u2019s work in Ukraine.</p><p>\u201cI feel like I\u2019m having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu up here,\u201d Mr. Booker said, lashing Mr. Trump for circulating false allegations.</p><p>At one point, Ms. Harris aired a complaint that women\u2019s advocates have pressed for months: the lack of questions about abortion.</p><p>\u201cThis is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle. Not one word with all of these discussions about health care, on women\u2019s access to health care. It\u2019s outrageous,\u201d Ms. Harris said to cheers.</p><p>Gabbard hits The New York Times, CNN</p><p>Tulsi Gabbard attacked The New York Times, CNN, the \u201cmainstream media\u201d and others who have written about how Russians are praising her and encouraging her presidential campaign.</p><p>\u201cJust two days ago The New York Times put out an article saying that I\u2019m a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears,\u201d Ms. Gabbard said. \u201cThis morning a CNN commentator said on national television that I\u2019m an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.\u201d </p><p>The Times <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/12/us/politics/tulsi-gabbard.html\">article</url> did not describe Ms. Gabbard in these ways. It noted that she has drawn support from Russian state news media sources and others in that country, as well as white nationalist and members of the alt-right.</p><p>Her broadside came in response to a question about whether additional U.S. troops should be sent to protect Kurdish communities in Syria, who are under attack by Turkish troops following Mr. Trump pulling U.S. forces out of the country.</p><p>Ms. Gabbard repeatedly invoked the phrase \u201cregime change war\u201d to describe American policy abroad and in the Middle East in particular.</p><p>\u201cAs president I will end these regime change wars by doing two things \u2014 ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would make sure we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaeda in Syria who\u2019ve been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg, who like Ms. Gabbard is a military veteran, sharply disagreed.</p><p>\u201cWell, respectfully, congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence, it\u2019s a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president, of American allies and American values,\u201d he said. </p><p>Should billionaires exist?</p><p>Bernie Sanders got a question right in his wheelhouse: Should billionaires exist? He didn\u2019t quite say yes but did launch into his regular tirade against the ultra-wealthy, saying it is \u201ca moral and economic outrage\u201d that the three richest Americans control as much wealth as half the country.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, himself a billionaire, went next. He denounced corporate power and blamed Republicans for passing legislation cutting taxes for the wealthy.</p><p>\u201cThe results are as shameful as Senator Sanders said,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely wrong, undemocratic and unfair.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren then weighed in: \u201cMy question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax, it\u2019s why doesn\u2019t \u2014 does everyone else on this stage \u2014 think it\u2019s more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Biden then remarked, \u201cNo one is supporting billionaires.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Warren didn\u2019t quite roll her eyes, but she threw him a side eye.</p><p>Ms. Klobuchar weighed in soon after: \u201cI want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth. No one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. We have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea.\u201d</p><p>Health care reveals schism among Democrats</p><p>The health care discussion showed the greater schism in the Democratic Party. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are on the side of eliminating private health insurance and installing a Medicare for all system, while Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar are on the other, castigating Medicare for all as a \u201cpipe dream,\u201d as the Minnesotan called it.</p><p>It is the broader debate rippling throughout the 2020 Democratic campaign trail. Polls show the party\u2019s voters tend to favor the Warren-Sanders proposals, but are nagged by whether a candidate running on eliminating private health insurance can win a general election. This is the crux of the Democratic debate: a pull between early-state voters\u2019 hearts and heads, with each of them becoming prognosticators guessing about what swing voters in key swing states might prefer.</p><p>Buttigieg and Klobuchar hit Warren hard on ending private health insurance</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, as she has done for weeks on the campaign trail, refused to entertain the question of whether \u201cMedicare for all\u201d will require a middle-class tax increase. </p><p>Instead she aimed to turn the question to overall costs.</p><p>\u201cLet me be clear on this,\u201d she said. \u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle class families.\u201d</p><p>She repeatedly refused to say. </p><p>Mayor Pete Buttigieg immediately pounced.</p><p>\u201cA yes or no question that did not get a yes or no answer,\u201d he said, saying it sounded like the type of things Americans hate about Washington. He added, \u201cYour signature senator is to have a plan for everything: Except this.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg then pitched his \u201cMedicare for all who want it.\u201d When Ms. Warren\u2019s turn came, she said that Mr. Buttigieg\u2019s vision amounts to \u201cMedicare for all who can afford it.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Buttigieg came back and said Ms. Warren would \u201cobliterate\u201d the private health insurance of 150 million Americans. \u201cIt\u2019s just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not,\u201d Mr. Buttigieg said, rebranding Ms. Warren\u2019s plan in a more negative light.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar followed up with her own hit on Ms. Warren. </p><p>\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here,\u201d Ms. Klobuchar interrupted, addressing Ms. Warren as \u201cElizabeth,\u201d saying Americans deserved to know where the \u201cinvoice\u201d was going.</p><p>Ms. Klobuchar continued, dismissing Ms. Warren\u2019s ideas as unrealistic, declaring there is a \u201cdifference between a plan and pipe dream.\u201d</p><p>It fell to Mr. Sanders to explain exactly what Medicare for all would require.</p><p>\u201cTaxes will go up,\u201d he said, before explaining that costs will go down because, under his plan, medical insurance premiums and co-pays would be eliminated.</p><p>Maggie Astor, Thomas Kaplan, Jonathan Martin, Sydney Ember, Katie Glueck and Kevin McKenna contributed reporting.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-100000006769403</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8T-YJF1-DXY4-X3HN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3388\"/><timeReceived>23:51 EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times <br/></publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Presidential Election of 2020</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Debates (Political)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The inquiry will focus on more than 400 strategic acquisitions over a decade, which big tech companies have used to cement their monopoly stranglehold, such as Facebook's purchase of competitors Instagram and WhatsApp.This perversion of market power was already flagrant during the Obama years, but the FTC\u2014with a majority ofDemocraticappointees\u2014did nothing. </p><p>Call me cynical, but did this lapse have something to do with the fact that Silicon Valley, liberal on social issues, reactionary on economic ones, tends to supportDemocrats?And is Trump's FTC playing against type for the flipside of the same reason? A Trump nemesis is Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who also publishesThe Washington Post. Break the bastard's rice bowl.And speaking of rice bowls (pardon the stereotype), Trump has also been eating the lunch of corporateDemocratson the trade issue. While the trade agenda of Clinton and Obama was a pure corporate wish list, Trump managed to make China an issue. Though the China trade deal gets at none of the underlying issues in China's system of state subsidies, China agrees to buy more American stuff and Trump still gains bragging rights.And on the NAFTA renegotiation, Trump (or rather his top trade negotiator, Bob Lighthizer, prodded byDemocrats) managed the very real achievement of getting rid of the 'investor-state' provision, which allows corporations to sue for damages in special, extra-judicial private panels, if they contend that health, safety, financial, or environmental regulations in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico, have cost them profits. So far, governments under this provision have paid a half-billion dollars in damages. That's now mercifully gone.So when Trump on the campaign trail goes after a few high-profile corporate outsourcers, and claims NAFTA and the China trade deal as big wins for American workers, we can blame Wall Street and Silicon ValleyDemocratsfor giving him the opening.And the cure for this is Michael Bloomberg? </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TPPD102301158154124872075776100189</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TPPD-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-PYG1-F03R-N4T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"375\"/><timeReceived>9:00 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The American Prospect Blogs</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and other prominent big tech critics seized on a Wall Street Journal report that said Amazon employees have used information collected from third-party sellers to launch competing products - even though the company testified to the House Judiciary Committee in July that it does not.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is exactly what happens when you let a giant company be both the umpire and a player in the game,\" Warren said in a statement. \"Amazon needs to explain why it misled Congress - and we need to break up Amazon and big tech.\"</p><p>Amazon disputed the accuracy of the Journal's account and said it did not offer \"intentionally misleading\" testimony, but said it would conduct an internal investigation into the report.</p><p>The committee's leaders vowed Thursday evening to press the company for answers.</p><p>\"At best, Amazon's witness appears to have misrepresented key aspects of Amazon's business practices while omitting important details in response to pointed questioning,\" said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), chairman of House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee. \"At worst, the witness Amazon sent to speak on its behalf may have lied to Congress.\"</p><p>Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) said the panel plans \"to seek clarification from Amazon in short order, in light of this troubling report.\"</p><p>The Journal's story, based on documents and interviews with former workers, said Amazon employees \"have used data about independent sellers on the company's platform to develop competing products,\" even though that goes against both the company's stated policies and past pledges by its executives. The revelation immediately reignited long-standing concerns, previously expressed by regulators in Europe, that Amazon has used the vast reams of data it collects from third parties on its marketplace to unfairly benefit its own business.</p><p>The report comes as big tech companies increasingly face accusations of abuses of power ranging from predatory pricing to failing to protect user privacy. While Amazon has become a key supplier to homebound Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, the outbreak has also increased scrutiny of the company's worker safety conditions and the way it presents third-party products on its website.</p><p>At a hearing on antitrust concerns in July, Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton testified before Cicilline's subcommittee that the company does not \"use individual seller data to directly compete with them.\" Sutton's testimony at the hearing later drew scrutiny from Cicilline, who questioned the veracity of his remarks regarding third-party sellers.</p><p>Amazon said Thursday in a statement that it prohibits \"employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch.\"</p><p>\"While we don't believe these claims are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation,\" the statement said.</p><p>The company also rejected Warren's characterization of its statements to Congress.</p><p>\"It's simply incorrect to say that Amazon was intentionally misleading in our testimony,\" Amazon spokesperson Maxine Tagay said.</p><p>But the Journal's report quickly prompted condemnation from an array of antitrust hawks.</p><p>\"The Committee should make a criminal referral for perjury, and the Department of Justice should investigate what Mr. Sutton knew and when he knew it,\" said Sarah Miller, executive director for the American Economic Liberties Project, a group that champions more stringent antitrust enforcement.</p><p>\"The House Judiciary Committee needs to call Jeff Bezos to testify,\" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance.</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), the libertarian-leaning chairman of the Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee, said in a statement that he expects the DOJ and the FTC to look into the allegations as part of their ongoing tech investigations.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), who sits on the subcommittee, joined Warren in accusing Amazon of misleading Congress, calling the Journal's revelation \"damning\" proof that Amazon has been \"blatantly exploiting third-party sellers.\"</p><p>Warren last year called for Amazon and other tech giants to be broken up as part of her presidential campaign platform. She said she wanted to roll back Amazon's acquisition of Whole Foods and split apart business arms like Amazon Marketplace and AmazonBasics.</p><p>Leah Nylen contributed to this report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-205847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRJ-J6T1-F118-91F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><timeReceived>11:35 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000100</classCode><className>ANTITRUST &amp;

But few say how that would work or what the consequences might be.</p><p> At the same time, Silicon Valley is also a top fundraising destination for the candidates, with employees of major firms already having donated tens of thousands of dollars to their campaigns.</p><p> The most aggressive and fleshed-out proposal comes from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who will be one of the 14 candidates speaking at this weekend's California Democratic Party convention in San Francisco. Her campaign has booked a billboard for the week at Fourth and Townsend streets with her profile and the words \"Break Up Big Tech,\" encouraging people to text to support her campaign.</p><p> Warren released a proposal in March to break up Facebook, Google and Amazon as anticompetitive monopolies. The senator is a persistent critic of corporate America and advocate for consumers.</p><p> \"Today's big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" she wrote. \"They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else.\"</p><p> Warren's plan would designate big tech firms as \"platform utilities,\" which would restrict their ability to own entities with a stake on those platforms. That would require Amazon to spin off Amazon Basics, for example, and Google to spin off its advertising exchange business. The plan would also reverse mergers for each of the big three companies.</p><p> Other Democratic candidates have not gone as in-depth as Warren, but many have opened the door to splitting up the big firms. Sen. Bernie Sanders, independent-Vt., told Politico that he \"of course\" backed calls to break up Facebook. California Sen. Kamala Harris told CNN that \"we have to seriously take a look at that,\" calling at least for \"serious regulation.\" Former Vice President Joe Biden said breaking up Facebook is \"something we should take a really hard look at.\"</p><p>New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker said it would be inappropriate for a president to call for the breakup of a specific company without a process for evaluation, but told ABC News that whether \"it's Facebook, the pharma industry, even the agricultural industry \u2014 we've had a problem in America with corporate consolidation that is having really ill effects.\"</p><p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has proposed more rigorous antitrust laws and taxing companies that sell data. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke called for more regulation instead of splitting up the companies. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said there should be regulatory action against the big tech companies but stopped short of calling for their breakup.</p><p> The willingness of Democrats to embrace calls to increase the pressure on Silicon Valley speaks to a broader shift within the party away from lionizing its young moguls as saviors.</p><p> \"Oh what a difference four years makes,\" said Carl Guardino, president of the pro-business trade association Silicon Valley Leadership Group. \"A political party that used to run toward tech often seems to be running from tech, while using tech tools to do so.\"</p><p> Tech entrepreneur Michael McNerney, who is well-connected to Bay Area Democratic politics, said that early on, the tech industry \"was marked by youth and excitement and this attitude that anything can be accomplished. It was very globalist, it was welcoming of immigrants and very socially liberal, and all of these things packaged together I think resonated really well with the Democratic Party, and the feeling was very mutual.\"</p><p> But in the past two years, Democrats have become disillusioned by the way tech has disrupted other industries and key sectors of the economy, has helped misinformation spread about the 2016 election and has concentrated an enormous amount of wealth.</p><p> Progressives are also increasingly frustrated with tech, echoing complaints from the right about companies picking and choosing what political speech is acceptable and what gets banned, seemingly without explanation. Their language about tech is also more closely resembling complaints about big business writ large.</p><p> \"You see the impact of the 'move fast and break things' mentality that Mark Zuckerberg popularized, and the problem is they're breaking things that are fundamental to American society,\" said Aram Fischer, a San Francisco organizer for the progressive advocacy group Indivisible. \"From our ability to put roofs over our heads to finding accurate information, we can no longer depend on the systems that existed in the past, and furthermore you have multibillion-dollar industries that are largely built on finding regulatory and tax loopholes.\"</p><p> Still, skeptics of breaking up Silicon Valley giants and supporters alike say most of the candidates' statements seem to be appealing to a Democratic base more than they are serious policy proposals.</p><p> \"There is this unfortunate focus on the fact that tech companies are big and therefore they are somehow per se scary, without a lot of nuance put behind that,\" said Tim Sparapani, a privacy and tech policy expert who has worked for Facebook and the American Civil Liberties Union. He questioned focusing on tech exclusively as opposed to other anticompetitive economic sectors with widespread impact, like agribusiness.</p><p> Sparapani also argued that splitting companies into smaller components would make oversight of each one more difficult. And with Chinese tech firms under no similar pressure to downsize, any breakup policy would risk undermining U.S. competitiveness in the tech industry, he said. That would have economic as well as national security implications.</p><p> \"Some of the proposals to break up these big tech companies have not thought two or three steps down the table,\" Sparapani said. \"It's not logical, and we may set off a chain reaction where we make it that the world's 10 largest tech companies are all Chinese and we have no influences as American voters over the patterns and practices of those companies. That would be a complete backfire.\"</p><p> For now, Democrats from different perspectives are waiting to see if candidates can develop more specific plans, to preserve the benefits of technology while cutting the negative effects.</p><p> \"I don't expect to be satisfied right now, and I'm paying a lot of attention and putting in actual work on this particular issue,\" said Fischer, who noted it's early in the race.</p><p> \"I'm ready to be wooed,\" Guardino said.</p><p> Tal Kopan is The San Francisco Chronicle's Washington correspondent.

Over the last three months, President Donald Trump has issued orders targeting not only Twitter, the highly politicized social media platform he uses incessantly, but TikTok, a Chinese-owned service known mainly as a place to share teen dance memes. Democrats used a high-profile congressional hearing in July to bash Google and Amazon, two of America's most successful companies, for allegedly anti-competitive practices. And members of both political parties repeatedly went after Facebook for restricting too much speech\u2014and for not restricting enough. Big Tech just can't win.   In one sense, none of this is new. For the better part of the last decade, Silicon Valley has been on the outs. Politicians on both sides of the aisle have targeted it. Mainstream media has become increasingly critical. Ordinary people have begun to treat the internet, and the opportunities it has created, as a nuisance. Even as their products have transformed nearly every aspect of everyday life, large tech companies have been subject to increasingly negative public perception and attendant political attacks.   Yet for a brief moment this spring, as the U.S. shut down and stayed home in response to the coronavirus, it looked like American tech companies might be making a reputational comeback. With everyone trapped at home and indoors, Big Tech provided a lifeline, connecting Americans to food, entertainment, work, and each other. But America's temporary truce with Big Tech wasn't to last. Nearly five months into the pandemic, it appears any newfound goodwill earned by Silicon Valley has already been burned.   \"There was a small window of time where everyone was grateful that technology was allowing us to continue to function as a society despite our inability to gather in physical spaces,\" Santa Clara University law professor Eric Goldman tells Reason . \"And yet that gratitude wore off so quickly. Everyone just went right back to hating on internet companies and forgetting all the great things we're benefiting from today.\"   Why the sudden reversal? Perhaps because the political battle against Big Tech\u2014and attempts to make it a populist cause\u2014has been based on a loose constellation of personal grievances, culture war opportunism, crime panic, and corporate rivalry\u2014all of which were on display in a recent congressional hearing in which the top executives of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon were grilled, often inartfully, by members of Congress.   In theory, that hearing was focused on antitrust concerns. But members of both parties repeatedly brought up frustrations with how social media platforms and search engines were handling user content\u2014a reminder that the future of Big Tech is inevitably bound up with the future of free speech. That same impulse was on display days later when Trump issued his executive order on the \"threat posed by TikTok.\" Somehow, the app had been caught in the middle of the culture war, the trade war, fears of a foreign power, and panic over social media speech and user privacy, all at once.   In the COVID-19 era, federal tech policy has become a vehicle for conspiratorial and authoritarian impulses of all kinds. Politicians attacking Big Tech have invoked Silicon Valley elites, Russian bots, Chinese spies, Middle Eastern terrorists, domestic sex predators, gun violence, revenge porn, internet addiction, \"hate speech,\" human trafficking, and the fate of democracy as reasons for action. Whatever works to distract people from their attempts to interfere in American freedom of expression, commerce, and privacy. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter\u2014even platforms as seemingly superficial and politics-free as TikTok\u2014have all been swept up into a wide-ranging political war on the foundations of online life and culture.   It might be working. Even as Big Tech has benefited ordinary people in countless ways, political backlash to the size and power of America's largest technology companies\u2014what some insiders call \"techlash\"\u2014is coming stronger than ever. And it could make addressing everything from the pandemic to election integrity, cancel culture, criminal activity, police reform, racial justice, and state surveillance of our digital lives so much worse.    The Story of Section 230   So how did we get here? In many ways, the story starts in 1996, when the World Wide Web was relatively new and full of radical possibilities\u2014and also potential for harm.   In response, Congress passed a law, the Communications Decency Act (CDA), that attempted to regulate online content and was mostly declared an unconstitutional, unenforceable mess. But the courts let one part be: Section 230. This short statute stipulates that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" That's the first bit, and it's vitally important for freedom of expression online because it gives tech companies less motivation to censor speech.   The second part, meanwhile, is more about protecting users from harmful content by assuring these companies that they won't be penalized for \"good faith\" actions \"to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected,\" nor would providing \"the technical means to restrict access to material\" they find objectionable. The so-called \"Good Samaritan\" provision lets tech companies moderate and block some content without becoming targets for criminal charges or lawsuits.   Overall, it gave tech entities a way to protect their users' (and their own) First Amendment rights without requiring a prolonged court battle for every single piece of disputed content. And for a long time, very few people, politicians, or interest groups thought this was a bad thing (to the extent that they had ever heard of this wonky internet law at all).   A decade later, blogs, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and other web 2.0 technologies had shifted the balance of power on the internet to favor the masses over the gatekeepers. Time magazine declared \"you\" \u2014the user of these digital services\u2014the person of the year. In the Middle East and other conflicted areas, populist rebellions against autocratic leaders were spread internally and globally through Twitter. Meanwhile, in the U.S., social media has given rise to underrepresented voices and political ideas often ignored by establishment powers. Its ability to document and share police abuses against black Americans in Ferguson, Missouri, and beyond made it integral in launching a new civil rights and social justice movement. The internet was a force for individual empowerment, and thus for good.   But all that freedom\u2014to speak, to share, to joke, to communicate, to connect\u2014was messy. It allowed people to speak truth to power, and also to spread misinformation. It created new ways to shine light on injustice, and new means to perpetuate it. It gave politicians a more direct-to-the-people megaphone\u2014and vice versa. It spread sociability and solidarity while simultaneously enabling identity trickery, scammers, saboteurs, scandals, and pile-ons. It gave a platform to vital information, ideas, and images as well as vile expressions of violence and hate. And, as the 2016 election approached, it became mired in increasingly angry partisan political disputes.   Within a few years, Republicans and Democrats in Congress could hardly agree about anything when it came to diagnosing issues with online life. But they coalesced around similar solutions: more federal regulations and criminal investigations. Using antitrust laws against sites and services that have gotten too popular. Suddenly, high-profile pundits and politicians\u2014from former Vice President Joe Biden to a range of Republican senators to Fox News host Tucker Carlson to left-leaning newspaper columns\u2014started calling for Section 230 to go. Big Tech was a threat, and it had to be contained.  Big Tech vs. Big Virus   Which brings us to the present, and COVID-19.   In the early days of the pandemic, Amazon deliveries seemed to be single-handedly keeping at least half of America stocked with groceries, hand sanitizer, and household supplies. Meanwhile, Zoom became the standout service for staying in touch.   During the worst days of personal protective gear shortages, Italian hospital horror stories, and general mass panic, Silicon Valley's leading lights donated money and much-needed supplies. By the end of March, for example, Apple had announced it would donate some 2 million masks to medical workers, while Facebook and Tesla immediately offered hundreds of thousands of masks they'd had on hand for wildfires. Tesla also donated 1,200 ventilators when those were in short supply. Google gave away hundreds of millions in free ad space to groups working to combat COVID-19's impact.   Meanwhile, social media allowed people to talk through new research and share ideas, as widespread videoconferencing\u2014once the province of science fiction\u2014allowed people to gather, exercise, hold business meetings, have happy hours, celebrate special occasions, and console distant loved ones from within their own homes.   And as businesses shuttered and economic turmoil spread, tech tools from peer-to-peer payment apps like Venmo and Cash App to crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe, document sharing services like Google Docs, and myriad others allowed people to organize mutual aid funds, spread the word about volunteer initiatives, ask for help, give directly to those in need, and share specialized community resources.   Of course, COVID-19 also meant that people were\u2014and are\u2014more reliant on tech-mediated reality than ever before. Those excluded from or marginalized in certain digital arenas had more reason to grow resentful. Politicians had more reasons to want to grab control. All of us had more opportunities to muck things up by speaking too hastily or picking the wrong side of what seemed like a billion new battles a week.   In a pandemic, the internet's freedoms were messier than ever. And that messiness fueled a new wave of tech-skeptical politics.    Coronavirus and the Crisis of Truth  Almost immediately, lawmakers began publicly bashing tech providers and calling for investigations. Amazon faced accusations of price gouging during the pandemic. Zoom was targeted as a threat to user privacy. In June, Sen. Josh Hawley (R\u2013Mo.), a longtime critic of Google and Facebook, introduced legislation to curtail Section 230. Meanwhile, the country was erupting in protests and upheaval following the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.   \"We're back to politicians spending time talking about Section 230 and breaking up platforms,\" TechFreedom's Ashkhen Kazaryan said in June, \"while the country is still being torn apart by both racial injustice and the pandemic.\"   Some of this renewed animosity was probably unavoidable, simply because so much contentious discourse is mediated through social media. Yvette Butler, an assistant professor of law at the University of Mississippi, thinks the pandemic has brought a heightened sense that social media platforms have a moral responsibility \"to fact-check and promote the truth.\"   Some of it has been spurred by tech leaders getting too political, or at least taking actions that are perceived that way.   \"It's both the fact that the political discourse has been very charged in the past few weeks and a lot of it has happened on these platforms, and the fact that by default the tech leaders are participating in the political dialogue,\" says Kazaryan.   She thinks \"the pressure point\u2014the point of no return for this\u2014was the protests for reopening America,\" when Facebook angered a lot of people by banning pages for some anti-lockdown events . Then, Twitter and Snapchat actions against Trump's accounts followed suit.   Michael Solana, vice president of the San Francisco\u2013based Founders Fund, a venture capital firm that counts Peter Thiel and an array of other Silicon Valley heavyweights among its partners, suggests that gripes about social media are creating more than just a media-driven backlash this time. \"The left now generally believes Facebook is why Trump won. The right believes they're being censored by like five white Communists who went to the same school and now live in multi-million dollar homes in Atherton [California] and San Francisco,\" he says. \"Both sides seem to want blood.\"  Trump Steps In  The temporary truce came to a definitive end with Trump's May 28 executive order  on social media speech, following Twitter's decision to fact-check Trump's tweets .   A day earlier, Twitter had affixed blue exclamation-point icons and links saying \"Get the facts about mail-in ballots\" beneath two Trump tweets about mail-in voting , in which the president had said \"there is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent\" and made false claims about California's vote-by-mail process.   Clicking the Twitter link led users to a page titled \" Trump makes unsubstantiated claim that mail-in ballots will lead to voter fraud ,\" where Twitter explained its move (\"part of our efforts to enforce our civic integrity policy\") and included a series of tweets from media outlets, nonprofit groups, and journalists countering the president's claims.   Trump's subsequent order suggests that Twitter's fact-check \"clearly reflects political bias\" and therefore somehow amounts to illegal censorship.   A private company cannot censor the president of the United States, at least not in the sense that they'd be violating the First Amendment, which protects private speech from government restrictions. But Trump's order attempts to reposition free speech as forcing private companies to follow government-set content standards and forbidding them from countering false claims made by him and his administration.   The president's order also completely mangles descriptions of Section 230 in the course of calling for it to be amended.   \"When large, powerful social media companies censor opinions with which they disagree, they exercise a dangerous power. They cease functioning as passive bulletin boards, and ought to be viewed and treated as content creators,\" states the order.   In this passage and throughout the decree, Trump argues that companies cross a legal threshold by exercising judgment about user content and forfeit the right to be treated as legally separate from their users. Trump portrays all of this as the mandate laid out in Section 230.   But the idea that these companies must be some sort of neutral conduits of user speech (or else cross an imaginary legal line between being a \"publisher\" or \"forum\" or \"platform\") is not just pure fiction but also the exact opposite of both the intent and the function of Section 230. The whole point of the law is to protect the editorial discretion and content moderation of tech companies.   \"Section 230 was never meant to require neutrality,\" said former Sen. Christopher Cox (R\u2013Calif.), who co-authored Section 230 along with Sen. Ron Wyden (D\u2013Ore.) some 25 years ago, at a July 28 hearing held by the Senate Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, Innovation, and the Internet. \"To the contrary, the idea is that every website should be free to come up with its own approach\" to content moderation, Cox said.   Nonetheless, Trump's order directs the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to review ways that Twitter and other tech companies might be exhibiting bias and how this might be used to say Section 230 doesn't apply to them. And, in July, the Department of Commerce formally asked the FCC to follow through.   The good news is that the FCC can do little to reinterpret a law whose statute is so clear, and at least several commissioners appear to have little interest in looking for interpretive wiggle room.   \"The FCC shouldn't take this bait,\" Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a July 27 statement. \"While social media can be frustrating, turning this agency into the President's speech police is not the answer.\"   \"We're an independent agency,\" Commissioner Geoffrey Starks pointed out during a July 17 panel hosted by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, adding that the \"debate [about Section 230] belongs to Congress.\"    'Censorship Is a Bipartisan Objective'  That Trump's executive order on social media is toothless is a good thing, since Section 230 has allowed so much of what we love (and politicians hate) about the modern internet to flourish . However, the order seems to be working as a political rallying cry on the right.   It's \"so cartoonish that you would think people on his side would distance themselves from it,\" says Goldman. Yet the order, \"for all its cartoonishness, seems to be getting people in line instead of pushing them away.\"   For Republicans, animosity toward Section 230 turns largely on alleged fears about anti-conservative bias from social media companies. \"That [idea] has penetrated pretty deeply among the activist and politician class\" on the right,\" says Zach Graves, head of policy at the Lincoln Network.   Though Graves thinks Trump's executive order on social media is pure \"political theater\" and \"won't get anywhere by itself,\" he notes that \"there are a lot of other grievances\" besides the alleged anti-conservative attitudes.   In early June, the American Principles Project\u2014a newly launched think tank dedicated to promoting nationalist and Trump-friendly public policy\u2014 released a plan for altering Section 230 aimed at \"protecting children from pornography and other harmful content\" in \"the digital public square.\" Mike Masnick, executive editor of Techdirt , described the proposal as an attempt \"to bring back the rest of the Communications Decency Act\"\u2014that is, the parts aside from Section 230, all of which were struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional.   By the end of June, the Department of Justice had released its own four-pronged reform proposal and South Dakota Republican Sen. John Thune\u2014joined by Hawaii Democrat Brian Schatz\u2014offered up the Platform Accountability and Consumer Transparency (PACT) Act , a bill that would put the federal government at the center of social media content moderation .   The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a digital privacy rights nonprofit, called the PACT Act \"a serious effort to tackle a serious problem: that a handful of large online platforms dominate users' ability to speak online.\" But it opposes the bill because of well-founded fears of unintended consequences, including \"more illegitimate censorship of user content\" by dominant tech companies; its threat to \"small platforms and would-be competitors to the current dominant players\"; and the \"First Amendment problems\" it presents.   In July, Hawley introduced a less serious effort: the Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services (BAD ADS) Act , which Hawley's office describes as \"a bill to remove Section 230 immunity from Big Tech companies that display manipulative, behavioral ads or provide data to be used for them\" and \"crack down on behavioral advertising's negative effects, which include invasive data collection and user manipulation through design choices.\" (This follows two of Hawley's previous anti-tech measures on similar themes going nowhere.)   Meanwhile, Democrats have been sounding anti-tech alarms , too, as well as pursuing similar solutions, albeit under different guises. For instance, Beto O'Rourke, during his presidential run, included Section 230 reform in his proposal for \"combating hate and violence.\"   Democratic Senator and vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris has targeted Section 230 as part of her crusade against \"revenge porn.\"   And in response to Facebook refusing to remove an ad featuring false information about Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate said in January that \"Section 230 should be revoked, immediately \u2026 for Zuckerberg and other platforms.\"   People on both the right and the left \"want to erode [Section 230] in order to put an affirmative pressure on platforms to be cops for various kinds of harms or illegal activities,\" says Graves, \"and there are people who think liability is the tool to do that.\" The Overton window on the issue has been moved, he adds.   \"It used to be a kind of sacred cow that people couldn't touch\" but now there are coalitions with well over 60 votes in the U.S. Senate to take action on Section 230 and even to revoke it, Graves says. \"But it probably won't be wholesale, it will be chipping away based on a feel-good cause.\"   That's exactly the point of the EARN IT Act . Proposed in March by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R\u2013S.C.), the bill\u2014which got a hearing in March and was placed on the Senate calendar in July\u2014targets Section 230 under the guise of stopping the \"online sexual exploitation of children.\" It has a roster of prominent bipartisan co-sponsors, including Richard Blumenthal (D\u2013Conn.), Ted Cruz (R\u2013Texas), Dianne Feinstein (D\u2013Calif.), and Chuck Grassley (R\u2013Iowa).   The legislation that began this trend\u2014 the 2018 law, FOSTA \u2014was also alleged to target online sexual exploitation and also enjoyed extremely bipartisan support. FOSTA was sold as a bill to target child sex traffickers, but really took aim at consensual adult prostitution and sex work more broadly, as well as online speech about these issues. (Prominent Democrats including Sens. Ro Khanna, Elizabeth Warren, and Bernie Sanders have since backed legislation aimed at studying FOSTA's impact and perhaps working toward its repeal, but it has yet to gain hardly any traction.)   The fight to abolish or severely restrict Section 230 shows \"how tempting censorship is to all sides,\" says Goldman. \"Turns out that censorship is a bipartisan objective.\"   Perhaps that explains why\u2014with so many life-or-death matters on American minds right now and an election on the close horizon\u2014authorities are still paying so much attention to relatively obscure tech policy laws and the content moderation moods of private companies.   With the COVID-19 pandemic still raging on, police brutality and racial justice issues under a microscope, and urgency around concerns like voter suppression, \"you would think Section 230 would drop down the list\" of things politicians spend time talking about, says Goldman. \"But you know, censorship is like catnip to regulators.\"   It's anyone's guess whether political focus on social media rules and internet regulation will persist as the 2020 election season really gets underway. \"A lot depends on Trump,\" says Goldman. \"If he wants to keep banging this drum, that's going to keep ratcheting up the pressure on Section 230.\"   But even if backlash against Section 230 quiets down, there are no shortage of election-friendly issues for politicians and parties to wield against tech companies.   In the last week of July alone, the Senate held a hearing on digital copyright law and the aforementioned Section 230 hearing featuring the law's author, Cox, (a spectacle loosely centered around the PACT Act) while the House hauled the chief executives of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google before its Judiciary Committee.   The latter was purportedly a probe into possible violations of federal antitrust law, but turned into a long, weird airing of grievances against tech companies that had little to do with anti-competitive business practices and often saw Democrats and Republicans proposing diametrically opposed solutions for these companies to adopt. At times, lawmakers from both parties went back and forth between demands for more content and users to be suppressed, and less.   The hearing hopped seemingly at random from topic to topic: Lawmakers asked about, among other things, social media content moderation, election integrity, fake news, privacy issues, data collection transparency, counterfeit products in online marketplaces, ideological diversity among tech company staff, court-ordered takedowns of speech, general support for \"American values,\" contracts with foreign governments, working with police and turning over user data without warrants, how search engines work, how Apple chooses what apps and podcasts to allow in its stores, and even how Gmail content gets marked as spam.   More than a few times, their questions made clear they had no idea what they were talking about. (One Republican asked Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, why the platform had taken down a post by Donald Trump, Jr., but the takedown had actually occurred on Twitter.) Their demands were often contradictory. The only clear implication of the hearing was this: There was no way for tech companies to win.  'We Will Lose a Little Bit of Freedom'  Looked at one way, the techlash makes little sense since it comes at a time when Americans are relying more than ever on technology to mediate their lives. But that may be exactly why the industry has come under fire.   When it comes to the pandemic, \"I do think there's going to be a [tech policy] reaction,\" says Arthur Rizer, \"and I think that reaction is going to be that we will lose a little bit of freedom through technology for the sake of safety, as it historically has always been.\" As one example, he points to the use of facial recognition technology by police departments who said it would only be used for solving certain serious crimes but recently admitted to \"using it to find who was out and about during quarantine.\"   \"Every time this country faces an emergency,\" Rizer says, \"we kind of act poorly when it comes to our civil liberties.\"   Kazaryan notes that a new California \"privacy\" law places serious burdens of time and money on any businesses that interact online\u2014something that could prove tough right now, especially for small businesses, as people struggle to come back from the pandemic and lockdowns. Yet its requirements and effects have received little attention amid all the chaos right now.   Pressure from outside-government groups to ramp up regulation on digital media and tech companies could also grow if economic pressure gets worse.   Graves sees techlash partly as a normal response to \"the growth in power and pervasiveness of the companies,\" with them simply facing the same sort of interference and resistance that any mega-corporation gets from regulators and activists.   \"Part of it is fears and anxieties\" about the power they have. But another part of the push for new tech regulation is \"opportunistic,\" he adds, pointing to hotel industry lobbying against Section 230 because it benefits home-sharing companies like Airbnb, or newspapers lobbying against it because it helps their digital competitors.   \"A lot of what's driving the techlash is these sort of inter-industry fights,\" not because \"it's the issue that people are thinking about when they're going to the polling booth,\" Graves says. And right now, with \"a collapse in the advertising market [and] a lot more consolidation in some industries,\" this sort of competition\u2014and attempts to use government regulation to one side's advantage\u2014only stands to get worse.   In the case of TikTok, Chinese parent company ByteDance seems to have gotten caught up in two different political fights. The first is the Trump administration's international power struggle with the Chinese government and associated worries that the Chinese government could order companies to turn over data about U.S. users. The second involves the president's personal grievances with the app, after TikTok teens were rumored to have signed up for tickets to a Trump campaign rally and then not used them, leaving the president planning for heavy rally attendance that didn't pan out.   In addition to political threats and competitive pressure, large tech companies\u2014particularly Facebook\u2014are facing demands from progressive activists and identity-based interest groups to crack down on more speech. Earlier this summer, groups including the Anti-Defamation League and the NAACP \"helped push hundreds of companies, such as Unilever and Best Buy, to pause their advertising on Facebook to protest its handling of toxic speech and misinformation,\" as The New York Times reported . Misinformation fears and activism around them seems only likely to increase as the election heats up and the pandemic wears on. And that means pressure to crack down is likely to increase.  Techlash Could Make Coping With COVID-19 and Documenting Police Abuse More Difficult  If and when that happens, it will be our loss.   Not only does the political obsession with regulating and punishing Big Tech distract from more pressing issues, from police abuse to the economic downturn due to pandemic-related lockdowns, it also makes it more likely that we will struggle to address those problems.   Think about all the ways digital tools and tech companies have ensured access to up-to-date and diverse information during the pandemic. Think about all the online streaming services, interactive video games, e-book purveyors, podcast makers, and apps that have been keeping us entertained. The many kinds of free chat services letting us keep in touch with friends, family, and colleagues. The online educational tools helping to make homeschooling at least somewhat tenable. All the crowdfunding donation platforms, people-powered marketplaces like Etsy and eBay, and gig economy apps from Uber to Patreon that are helping people make ends meet.   It's fair to say this is far from ideal. But without today's technology, it would be so much worse.   Now think about the recent pushback against law enforcement being able to hurt and kill people\u2014especially black Americans\u2014with impunity. Think about the way we've seen police and federal agents react in recent weeks to protesters and the press covering them.   Think about how much of that would still have happened without not just smartphones and digital video but also quick, accessible, and gatekeeper-free ways to share and spread that video.   Without social media, \"there are so many important conversations that would have never happened,\" says Kazaryan, referring to recent protests and activism around police racism and brutality. In addition, she points out, \"tech companies have been creating jobs and providing tools for people to do their jobs\" while we deal with the coronavirus.   A more immediate consequence of anti-Section 230 efforts will be forcing social media companies\u2014and the rest of the internet along with them\u2014to crack down on content from users and ratchet up content and account removals.   By seriously raising the legal hoops that these entities must jump through to defend their First Amendment rights, and the potential legal liabilities if they can't, the government will leave online speech platforms with little choice but to severely curtail the amount and types of speech allowed\u2014thereby increasing the social media \"censorship\" problems that Trump and company say they're out to fix. The only other sound strategy for these companies is to give up on content moderation entirely to avoid any way of \"knowing\" about bad content\u2014thereby increasing the amount of obscene, violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable content which anti-Section 230 laws claim to thwart.   So what looked like a moment of redemption might turn out, instead, to be a tipping point in the other direction. \"I think that the fundamental forces driving the techlash are going to be made worse, not better, by COVID,\" says Graves.   \"Whatever goodwill that [tech companies] have picked up is either gone or [has] been spent,\" Rizer says.   The techlash may only just be getting started.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The Democratic Party wants to run the United States, not just the decaying urban centers and gentrifying coastal pockets -- Williamsburg, Baltimore -- both Portland, no. They want to run the entire thing. All 50 states, all 31,000 counties, all 320 million people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Progressives want complete control of all of that very much including your neighborhood. That's their goal in the coming election. What will happen if they achieve that goal? We don't have to guess, instead we can assess a city they already have complete control over and have for a long time, San Francisco, California.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now if there's any place in the country you'd like to run, because it would be easy, it would have to be San Francisco. The city is stunningly beautiful. It has a perfect climate. It's got solid infrastructure. There's a well-educated population.</p><p>But more than anything, it has a lot of money. San Francisco is one of the richest places in the world with a never ending torrent of tech cash. How could you screw that up? And you take a look at what the left has done with San Francisco.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): In some San Francisco neighborhoods, hold your nose and watch your step.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You see people lying on the streets, seeing people passed out on the street. You're seeing people eat out of garbage cans. You're seeing people shoot up.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (on camera): Adding to the danger, take a look junkies are just dumping their used syringes into the streets. Piles like this are commonplace.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Most of the needles are handed out by the San Francisco Department of Public Health to help reduce drug related diseases. But with no reliable way to get them all back, the city is spending $750,000.00 to hire 10 people whose sole job is to pick up the needles, some 8,000 every month.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Looks like the slum. Bombay, India doesn't look like that. So you'd think it would be affordable. But it's the opposite. Average rent for an apartment in San Francisco right now is about $4,000.00. The city works only for the extremely rich or the destitute, the billionaires and the vagrants. Normal people, there's no place for them.</p><p>You want to raise a family in the city? Good luck. San Francisco now has more daycare space for animals than it does for babies. It is literally a city without a future. Its people can't afford to reproduce.</p><p>And San Francisco isn't alone. The rest of California's single party cities are following suit. The homeless population in Los Angeles, for example, is now bigger than any city in the entire State of Vermont. It is filthy. Tent encampments are incubating diseases we previously associated with war-torn countries.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Over time, squalor built up on the streets with rats feasting on rotting food mixed with sewage and used syringes.</p><p>But far away from Skid Row, through rats and fleas, typhus traveled through the streets and the Deputy City Attorney who works way up on the sixth floor at City Hall got infected.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH GREENWOOD, DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY: I felt like I was going to die.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice over): Greenwood says the building has always had rats, but what's changed isn't what's in the building. It's what's around it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREENWOOD: The homeless population has moved closer and closer. They surround the building. So as folks walk to work and back, they're walking through rotting food, raw sewage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Typhus? What country is this? Who did this? You know who did it. They did the same thing in Sacramento. That's the state capital of California. Homelessness there has gotten so out of control that ordinary people can barely live there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ELIZABETH NOVAK, BUSINESS OWNER: I just want to tell you what happens when I get to work. I have to clean up the poop and the pee off of my doorstep. I have to clean up the syringes. I have to fight off people that push their way into my shop that are homeless and on drugs because you won't arrest them for drug offenses. I have to apologize to my clients. So I want to know what you're going to do for us, the ones that are unhappy.</p><p>You want to make a state sanctuary state. You want to make it comfortable for everybody except for the people that work hard and have tried their hardest to get along in life, and now we have to change that because of your lies.</p><p>So while you sit in your million dollar home and you don't have to look at what we have to look at, there's hardworking people out there that have to deal with this on a daily basis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's a disaster, obviously. And yet remarkably, cities around the country all of them run by the Democratic Party are racing to copy California.</p><p>Washington, D.C. is now covered with tents and filth. Drive around if you don't believe it. Seattle of course is, too. Portland, Oregon has been almost destroyed by it.</p><p>We've seen this before. For decades, Americans fled cities to escape from disorder and chaos and crime. New York got so desperate, it elected a Republican mayor.</p><p>And then finally in the 1990s, the tide turned. Crime fell and American cities became livable again. Property values rose, poor neighborhoods got better, everyone benefited and people started moving back. Places that had been shrinking for decades, cities like Washington and Philadelphia started growing again. It was a great success. But that progress is being reversed now, because on the left, law and order is now regarded as a hateful relic of a less progressive age.</p><p>Among America's 20 largest cities, San Francisco now has the highest property crime levels in the United States. There are 70 car break-ins every single day. For the past four years, violent crime on the city's BART trains has doubled. It is enabled by rampant fare evasion, which city officials are completely unwilling to stop.</p><p>Across the country, America's most liberal cities had mayors and DAs who explicitly side with the criminals even against their own citizens. We're not overstating this.</p><p>In Dallas County, Texas, for example, the District Attorney there, John Creuzot is refusing to criminally prosecute thefts of less than $750.00 if he decides this theft was a quote, \"necessary items.\" Okay.</p><p>In Philadelphia, meanwhile, the top prosecutor is a man called Larry Krasner, he believes American law enforcement is quote, \"systematically racist.\" So we stopped providing law enforcement at all in many places. In that city, prosecutors no longer see cash bail for what they call low level crimes. It's a category that includes burglary, not so low level if you're the target of it. Shoplifters receive a simple summons to court, instead of a misdemeanor or felony charge.</p><p>The results are not hard to predict. You know exactly what's going to happen when you govern like this. And in fact, it has happened. In 2018, Philadelphia had its highest murder rate in a decade. Compared just a few years ago, murder has dramatically surged in a bunch of different cities with similar programs -- Chicago, Baltimore, Washington, and yet no one on the left seems to notice any of this or care.</p><p>In fact, they seem to approve, apparently. They'd like the rest of the country to become just like San Francisco. Do you want that?</p><p>Joe Alioto is an attorney and a former San Francisco Police Commissioner, and he joins us now. Joe, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOE ALIOTO, FORMER SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT COMMISSIONER: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't -- look, I don't want to make this necessarily partisan because I think that there are a lot of Democrats, you're one of them, who look at the decay of our cities and say, you know, I'm not for this at all. I may be liberal, but I'm not -- I'm not on the side of criminals.</p><p>But you've got to be honest and say that cities run -- big cities run by the Democratic Party for decades, in most cases are not doing well right now. What does that tell us?</p><p>ALIOTO: Well, the Tucker it's not the Democratic Party. It's not even the progressives. If you go to Marin County, for example, right across the Bay, you're familiar with that area.</p><p>CARLSON: Very.</p><p>ALIOTO: That's a very progressive area. You can't defecate on the streets there. You can't shoot up needles there. You can't do all the things that you can do on the streets of San Francisco, because that will get thrown in jail.</p><p>CARLSON: No, because that's where the ruling class lives and they keep out affordable housing as you know. They won't put up with any of this crap because they actually live there.</p><p>ALIOTO: Right, well San Mateo is the exact same way and they're just you know, in the south of us. So north and south go either way. You've got progressives running the towns.</p><p>The issue is the leadership and the law enforcement and specifically in the DA prosecutor circles. We have a DA who is the absent father of the criminal justice system in San Francisco. He announced a year ago he wasn't going to run for reelection, and he did that because he wanted to go be with his mother in Southern California. Great. He hasn't been with his mother in Southern California, and in my opinion, hasn't showed up to work ever since then.</p><p>If you look at what's happening on the streets, if you are drug addicted, or mentally ill. Misdemeanors, infractions and violent felonies not happening in the presence of a police officer, go under the category of uninformed. It's just not enforced.</p><p>You see it every day on the street, just walking down the street, right in your video right there going through the BART station, there is no crime that is going to be enforced against those people.</p><p>CARLSON: But can I just say everything you say, of course, is true. But it's not just San Francisco. I mean, there's a broader theme here. It's not just one law enforcement official, one absentee prosecutor. This is happening in Washington, Baltimore. This is happening in Dallas, it is happening --</p><p>ALIOTO: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: Right? So it's happening in cities run by people with a very specific mindset and that mindset puts the rights of the criminal above the rights of the taxpayer.</p><p>ALIOTO: That's right. But this is not Democrats, progressive Democrats, this is more of a socialist communist wing of the Democratic Party that has become louder and louder. And I spoke of this the last time I was on your show. These are the people that are going to cause trouble. These are the people that President Trump is identifying our party with. And that's a problem because those aren't Democrats.</p><p>If you believe in universal wages, that's not a Democratic value. That's a socialist communist value. Those aren't the Democrats I grew up with.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, can I ask you then -- wait, hold on. If they are just -- I mean, I want to believe that the lunatics destroying your city which is the prettiest city in the United States, in my opinion and Portland, Oregon, another beautiful cities destroyed by them, I want to believe they are in a tiny minority. But if that's true, then well how did they get in power?</p><p>ALIOTO: Our mayor is not that way. It's our DA who is absent in our legislature is in many ways that way. So they are the problem. Our mayor tried to get more cops to patrol downtown San Francisco, the legislature wouldn't give it to her then she had to rush out and find money in ways to pay overtime cops to patrol Union Square, as you know, one of the most beautiful places in the city visited by all the tourists.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>ALIOTO: It's not our mayor. It's the legislature, and it is this board -- it is the Board of Supervisors, and it's the prosecutor who is out there not enforcing laws. All you have to do is cross the street over into the Presidio, they enforce laws there. That's the Federal government. Don't try and break a law there.</p><p>And by the way, what's unfair about this is that law abiding citizens, the working class people, if you are wealthy enough to own a car and not live in it, all the laws applies to you -- infractions, misdemeanors -- everything applies to you.</p><p>CARLSON: That is so true.</p><p>ALIOTO: Believe me, you miss paying a meter for more than five minutes, you've got $120.00 ticket in San Francisco.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right. But then they break into your car, and they make no effort to find the guy who broke into your car. They don't care.</p><p>ALIOTO: Unless you're A-Rod and you're famous and you're super wealthy, then we're going to send the cops out to dust your car. But don't worry about it. Nothing is going to happen there either because the DA won't prosecute even they catch the guy.</p><p>CARLSON: That's such a good point. It is a feudal -- it's a feudal society. Joe, thank you so much. Good to see you.</p><p>ALIOTO: Good to see you as well, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Feudal is exactly the word that Joel Kotkin has used to describe San Francisco. He is the Executive Director of the Center for Opportunity Urbanism. He is one of the great experts on American cities. He also teaches at Chapman University. He is author of the book, \"The Human City: Urbanism for the rest of us.\" We're happy to have Joel Kotkin on tonight. Joel, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOEL KOTKIN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR OPPORTUNITY URBANISM: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: So you noted the other day that San Francisco has more drug addicts than it has high school students. This is a kind of recognizable syndrome where cities become basically unlivable for normal people. How does this happen?</p><p>KOTKIN: Well, I think it's been happening over the years. For a while, it was because the cities were declining, then when the city started coming back, they became very expensive, and a lot of old, middle and working class neighborhoods were kind of undermined.</p><p>And now you have really in most of the really primary cities in this country, populations of young hipsters who will stay there for a few years, poor people who are dependent on the welfare state and some very, very wealthy people.</p><p>The middle class is literally becoming extinct, as is the family in much of an urban America today.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is all kinds of implications. But the truth is, as you well know, is that most of our important policy decisions are made by people who live in these places, which are, as you just said, completely cut off from the concerns of normal people -- completely cut off. How can you govern a country if you live in a place like this? Does it distort you?</p><p>KOTKIN: Well, you know, like Mr. Alioto, I'm an old line Democrat.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I know.</p><p>KOTKIN: And I think that there were some, you know, there were some great Democratic mayors who helped turn around cities. Bob Lanier in Houston being a prime example.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes. He was great.</p><p>KOTKIN: So it's not the politics, it's something that's happened. You know, you even look at, let's say it at Representative Cortez's district. There's such low voter turnout, that very small groups of militant people can actually win elections by being organized. She got about 16,000 votes in the primary in a district that had well over 300,000 Democrats.</p><p>So what we have is that people are not engaging in politics. This is part of the sort of feudalization, that's going on.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>KOTKIN: The middle and working class is just sort of saying, \"There's nothing we can do. So we're just going to either leave, or we're going to have to put up with it.\"</p><p>CARLSON: So angry, affluent children from Williamsburg get to make all the important decisions, let the least wise group in America gets to take control.</p><p>KOTKIN: Well, that's increasingly happening. If you look even in the city like Chicago, where they're now electing socialists to the City Council. Obviously, in Seattle. You've got this group of people in their 20s, early 30s, who are very, very militant. And in many cases, they don't care that the schools don't work. That's a big issue, too.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly.</p><p>KOTKIN: We are seeing here in California that we have some wonderful charter schools, but they're under attack by the teachers unions. Well, if you're a 25-year-old hipster living in Orange County or in LA County, what do you care about the charter schools?</p><p>CARLSON: That's right.</p><p>KOTKIN: You're more concerned with getting the support of the teachers unions.</p><p>CARLSON: It's a vortex. Joel Kotkin, thanks --</p><p>KOTKIN: And it just gets worse and worse.</p><p>CARLSON: It does get worse and worse.</p><p>KOTKIN: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Until people get engaged. Thanks a lot for joining us today.</p><p>KOTKIN: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it's a day ending in why, you know what that means. It means that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is calling another thing in America racist. We will tell you what it is this time, next.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it turns out that U.S. Customs and Border Protection may have allowed dangerous illegal immigrants to run free within this country's borders for years by ignoring a Federal law that would have let them be detected and stopped.</p><p>For details on the story, we turn tonight to Fox's Chief Intelligence Correspondent, Catherine Herridge -- Catherine?</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Well, thanks Tucker. The government watchdog notified the President and congressional Oversight Committees today that the Border Agency violated the law for nearly a decade and compromised public safety after failing to implement a DNA screening program for illegal migrants, quote, \"The agency's non-compliance with the law has allowed subjects subsequently accused of violent crimes, including homicide and sexual assault to elude detection even when detained multiple times by CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This is an unacceptable dereliction of the agency's law enforcement mandate.\"</p><p>Fox News first profiled the government whistleblowers last month who are behind the complaint. Under the law, CBP is required to collect DNA from individuals in custody and compare it against DNA in the F.B.I.'s violent crimes database.</p><p>The goal was to identify and then remove or prosecute illegal migrants whose DNA matched open cases from sexual assault, even murder. The Obama administration put DNA screening on hold in 2010 after then Secretary Janet Napolitano said Homeland Security had resource issues, and then Attorney General Eric Holder agreed.</p><p>But Special Counsel investigators sided with the whistleblowers that the waiver was never meant to be permanent.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's not a risk. It's factual, that since this law was passed, it was 10 years ago, U.S. citizens -- lawful permanent residents and others have been raped, harmed, and killed by people that CBP had in custody, in many respects, on multiple occasions, did not collect the DNA.</p><p>These people were either deported or released, to return back to this country and commit harm again, unto others. That is factual, and those numbers will --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERRIDGE: In the last hour, Fox News received this statement from a Homeland Security official confirming that Acting Secretary McAleenan has now directed Homeland Security to work with the Justice Department to finally move forward on the DNA collection program -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a story. Catherine Herridge, thanks a lot for that.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is not yet 30 years old. She has been in Congress for fewer than eight months, but she feels very confident that all 243 years of American History Prior to her arrival were a mistake.</p><p>In new video for Instagram, Ocasio-Cortez takes aim at the Electoral College. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (D-NY): We are coming to you live from the Electoral College. Many votes here as you can see, very efficient way to choose leadership of the country. I mean, I can't think of any other way, can you?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Now, you may think that the Electoral College has worked pretty well for almost two and a half centuries electing Democrats and Republicans in a way that served the country, the most powerful country in the world, best country -- but Ocasio-Cortez knows better. She is woke so she knows that of course the Electoral College is -- wait for it now -- racist.</p><p>Ocasio-Cortez accuses the Electoral College of having quote, \"a racial injustice break down that disfavors the votes of minority voters,\" so it has to go. Soon, we'll get rid of every American institution that existed before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p><p>Dana Perino hosts \"The Daily Briefing with Dana Perino,\" one of our favorite guests on the show, and she joins us tonight. So Dana, thanks for coming on. Very quick question as someone who has followed American politics for many years and has a deep grounding in its history, is the Electoral College racist?</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: It's such a disservice to the institution, to the framers of our Constitution, and to -- well, for one, it's just like it's bad for Civics Education. Think of how many people follow her on Instagram? And are now saying, \"Oh, yeah, okay, the Electoral College is racist.\" And because she drives through a rural area of the United States, and she is driving through flyover country, then she thinks that it's okay to say that these people don't matter. The people that live here don't matter.</p><p>Well, we know that there are rural parts of the country. There are micro centers, there are urban centers -- there are all of these things.</p><p>The Electoral College, no, it is not racist. Nobody said it was racist, until recently. They didn't say it when Barack Obama won the Electoral College twice.</p><p>The other thing is, when she talks about this, not wanting the Electoral College, it's just the next step to saying that they don't want the United States Senate either.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: Because the United States Senate allows for two senators from every state. They don't want State's rights. They just want the cities of which you just highlighted in your A-block to be in charge across the country.</p><p>They don't want to have to persuade and use argumentation to say why their policy prescriptions would be better. I am an Electoral College traditionalist and an evangelist for the Electoral College and I would be happy to debate anybody about this.</p><p>I feel that strongly that the founders knew what they were doing when they set it up. Minority rule is -- I'm sorry, majority rule is not what we are set up to have. We are a Republic, we have States rights. You have the Electoral College.</p><p>And in fact, Colorado passed this law saying, okay, well, we don't even care what the Electoral College says, we are just going to do whatever the popular vote is.</p><p>Well, guess what today? The U.S. Appeals Court in Denver said, not so fast. That doesn't work in our country. So I also think it's futile what she is doing, because the Electoral College is not going to change in our lifetime. They will try --</p><p>CARLSON: But you just said that you would be happy to debate anyone on the question of the Electoral College.</p><p>PERINO: Sure.</p><p>CARLSON: And I have no doubt that you would win. She doesn't -- and people like her don't seek a debate. They seek to take the question off the debate table by calling it racist, in other words, immoral. In other words, your position isn't even worth hearing, because you're a bad person, because you're racist because you support a racist institution. I mean, what does that kind of thinking do to our public discourse?</p><p>PERINO: Well, it is growing because there are, I think, eight of the Democratic candidates for President in 2020, all support, getting rid of the Electoral College. Now, that's a lot, right?</p><p>Imagine how many people are out there hearing that the Electoral College is the bane of their existence. Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa put out a statement today in which she said that this would silence voters and voices in Iowa. That's certainly not the way to win back the White House.</p><p>If you think you want to win, this is the system that they're going to have.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>PERINO: I think it's a good system. But I do think it's a disservice to say it should be abolished, without acknowledging that it actually has a purpose.</p><p>CARLSON: Right, exactly. And to deride --</p><p>PERINO: As racist.</p><p>CARLSON: Dismiss it as immoral. Right.</p><p>PERINO: Lincoln -- Abraham Lincoln, only won the presidency -- won the presidency because of the Electoral College.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly.</p><p>PERINO: And he was not racist.</p><p>CARLSON: Exactly. It just pollutes our discourse, that kind of language. Dana Perino, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much.</p><p>PERINO: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: And here's another glimpse of how they view -- the left views -- this country and its history. Hasan Piker is a host on The Young Turks Network. That's a left-wing news and politics broadcast. He has a half a million Facebook fans. Here's his description of why 9/11 happened. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HASAN PIKER, HOST, THE YOUNG TURKS NETWORK: America deserved 9/11, dude. [Bleep], I'm saying it. We totally brought it on ourselves, dude. Holy [bleep]. We did. How is this -- how is anything I'm saying controversial?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Three thousand Americans died on their way to work. America deserved 9/11. You may be shocked to hear that, but you really shouldn't be. Because the United States is immoral. The United States has a history that's embarrassing. The United States is a sinful country that should be destroyed.</p><p>That is basically the case that they're making day in and day out -- attacking the country. Is it a shock that someone who has finally just come out and said it plainly, the U.S. deserved 9/11? Thousands deserved to die. You shouldn't be shocked when they say that. Everything they've been saying for the last two years is leading up to that.</p><p>Well, Bernie Sanders is about to unveil his new climate plan. Only two things about it are certain. It probably won't make the environment any cleaner. It would make your life less pleasant. We will tell you what he has in mind for you, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, it looks like New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is not going to qualify for the next Democratic debate. Why? Because almost not a single person in America wants to vote for him. But de Blasio will not abandon his presidential campaign no matter how much it costs him in time and human dignity.</p><p>Today, for example, he spoke via video feed to the Iowa Federation of Labor and thanks to a technical error, he sounded like he just had taken a hit of helium or joined the cast of Alvin and the Chipmunks. Listen and enjoy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are doing something that should have been done a long time ago in this country. We're passing legislation this year to guarantee working people like every other industrialized country in the world to guarantee working people by law, two weeks paid vacation every year. That's the kind of thing that would transform people's lives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Maybe it wasn't a technical glitch. Maybe it was planned. After all, the number of people who would like to vote for a chipmunk is probably larger than the people who want to vote for de Blasio.</p><p>But that wasn't the most embarrassing thing that happened to a Democratic candidate this week. Pete Buttigieg was in Chicago the other night, trying to burnish his woke credentials by speaking in Chicago's Brownsville neighborhood. It's a historically African-American neighborhood. Guess how many African-Americans showed up to see Pete Buttigieg? Look at the crowd.</p><p>As Buttigieg railed against systemic racism, he looked around and almost nobody from the neighborhood was actually there. There didn't seem to be a single person from Brownsville. Instead, the place look like a Subaru dealership in Cambridge, guilty white liberals as far as the eye could see. You could have served avocado toast and launched an NPR pledge drive in the room. It was that pale.</p><p>Actual black people appear to be boycotting the event. They had better things to do and good for them.</p><p>Well, Senator Bernie Sanders is set to unveil his own version of the Green New Deal tomorrow. You can expect that it would have a lot of proposals that will make your life worse. After all, it's supposedly necessary because we face an existential threat. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The climate change is real, it is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If NATO is about the common defense, the biggest existential threat is climate.</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is climate change. It really is the existential threat.</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're going to have to address the most existential threat to our nation in the world -- climate change.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: On climate change, the greatest existential threat that we face.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We need to treat global climate change, like the existential threats that it is.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: That we are facing a climate crisis. It represents an existential threat to who we are as human beings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, maybe climate change is an existential threat, I am certainly open minded. But if it is, then why don't none of the Democratic responses seem very serious. None of them include, for example, ceasing to fly on private aircraft, which every single one of those people does all the time. Instead their proposals entail making them more powerful, shutting down the entire U.S. economy, or just petty proposals that make people's lives worse.</p><p>First, it was a ban on plastic straws and plastic bags. Now this week, the Federal ENERGY STAR Program recommended that Americans set their thermostats to 82 degrees at night in the summer, for the sake of stopping global warming.</p><p>Okay, you first. Mark Morano was the publisher of Climate Depot and the author of \"The Politically Incorrect Guide to Climate Change,\" and he joins us tonight. Mark, thanks a lot for coming on tonight.</p><p>So there is this weird disconnect between the nature of the threat which is terrifying, it's Godzilla basically going to destroy all of us. And their proposals, which are petty and small bore and disconnected from science. Why?</p><p>MARK MORANO, PUBLISHER, CLIMATE DEPOT: They are in fact. The best quote was a University of Pennsylvania scientist, a geologist who said, \"Even if we faced the climate catastrophe that they claim, none of the proposals offered by the EPA, the United Nations or the Green New Deal would have any impact on the climate if in fact, carbon dioxide controlled the climate.\" It's pure symbolism when it comes to the climate. And that's what's so shocking.</p><p>The Green New Deal is nothing more than the same solutions they were peddling in the 1960s and 70s for the overpopulation scare, for the resource scare -- limited resources scare.</p><p>CARLSON: Heat coil.</p><p>MORANO: Yes, and it's the same exact solution. All they're using is global warming as the latest scare to have the same solutions of wealth redistribution, sovereign limiting treaties, and massive intervention and central planning. That's all this Green New Deal is.</p><p>CARLSON: So actual scientists have noted, obviously, that if you're worried about carbon, you probably should plant more trees. But that might be a practical step we could take.</p><p>MORANO: Yes, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: There's zero interest I can see from any of these people in doing that. That would by the way, make the country prettier, but they have no interest in that. Why?</p><p>MORANO: No in fact, if you go -- Arnold Schwarzenegger, Governor of California, climate champion, a big champion of the Green New Deal and all of these other proposals.</p><p>CARLSON: Phony.</p><p>MORANO: He proposed to Californians as Governor in a video addressed to the state that they should air dry their clothes on a hanger for six months on the clothesline for six months in order to reduce their carbon footprint. At the same time, he was flying a daily jet to the Governor's Mansion to his house because -- for a very few people, but for Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Governor's Mansion was a step down in the quality of his life. So he daily commuted, but told Californians that they should have air drying clothes.</p><p>The same state by the way, in California mentioning ENERGY STAR in these regulations. They proposed emergency control over people's thermostats in 2008, in order to control the energy flow of California and this was -- even \"The New York Times\" balked at this and said, this is the outer limits. Remember the outer limits, something is going to be taking over your TV.</p><p>The government wanted to take over thermostats, not voluntary, but mandatory. There was such outrage, they stopped that. And that's the problem now we're facing with these ENERGY STAR regulations. It's a creeping thing. What's voluntary now is going to be mandatory under Green New Deal.</p><p>CARLSON: Why wasn't Republicans -- and I mean, I doubt they're clever enough to think of this on their own -- but why wouldn't some sitting United States Senator sponsor legislation that bans the use of private air travel for people who are concerned about -- or how about all private air travel? Why is this just as a symbolic measure? And just see who votes for it?</p><p>MORANO: That would be a fantastic idea. The Republican Party most of their time, they don't want to deal with this issue at all. Even Trump administration Cabinet members just are silent.</p><p>Trump himself is the only one in the administration who really wants to speak and push back on this agenda. So that's part of the problem.</p><p>CARLSON: The rest just want to lower capital gains tax.</p><p>MORANO: They want to talk about the regulatory impact, but they don't want to go at the heart of it. But that idea is a fantastic idea because it would expose them. Bernie Sanders himself, even Hillary staffers talked about how much he demanded that in order to campaign for it, they had to be on private jets. He spent millions on private jets back and forth during his 2016 campaign --</p><p>CARLSON: And the left makes excuses for this. \"The New Republic\" had an entire piece lecturing the rest of us who dared criticize Al Gore for having the largest single house in the State of Tennessee and commuting back and forth to New York in a private plane. We were the bad ones for noting that. It's really -- the hypocrisy is nauseating.</p><p>MORANO: It's nauseating, but it's not going anywhere, anytime soon. We have the -- you know, this teen activist coming to New York City who is going to take a yacht across the Atlantic because she doesn't want to fly. And it turns out that first of all, the yacht is made out of carbon fiber. It's made out of all sorts of fossil fuel, but they're going to have to fly the crew back to Europe.</p><p>So there's going to be all sorts of flights associated, but the symbolism of her on a yacht is all that matters.</p><p>CARLSON: It's all they care about. That's what it is. Mark, great to see you tonight. Thank you so much.</p><p>MORANO: Thank you, Tucker. Appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, Bill Gates, the billionaire has a remarkable number of connections to Jeffrey Epstein, and those links have continued all the way past Epstein's death. We've got details on that. Pretty fascinating, actually.</p><p>Plus, a supporter of Hillary Clinton says she is smearing him with lies, and he is fighting back. He joins us just ahead.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's an amazing story. A former adviser to Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, has been named as one of the executors of Jeffrey Epstein's will. And that's not the only weird connection between the Microsoft founder and Epstein. Chief Breaking News Correspondent, Trace Gallagher joins us tonight for more on the story. Hey, Trace.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, part of the baffling history of Jeffrey Epstein is how he was somehow able to surround himself with some of the world's most powerful people even after he pled guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute and became a registered sex offender.</p><p>For example, Prince Andrew was photographed coming out of Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2010, two years after Epstein served jail time, and now we're learning Microsoft founder Bill Gates not only spoke with Epstein on more than one occasion about philanthropic spending, but also flew on Epstein's private plane from New York to Palm Beach, though Gates reportedly refuses to say why.</p><p>And we should note the plane was not the so-called Lolita Express, which allegedly was used to fly underage girls to Epstein's private island. But still critics wonder why one of the world's richest men would need to take philanthropic advice from a convicted sex offender, especially considering what Melinda Gates and the couple's foundation does for young women around the world.</p><p>Separately, a former science adviser for Bill Gates was named as one of three executors of Jeffrey Epstein's $577 million will. Forty-nine-year- old Boris Nikolic says he was shocked to learn that Epstein named him and says he has no intention of fulfilling the duties.</p><p>Meantime, Attorney General Bill Barr gave an impromptu news conference today where he maintains that there were numerous irregularities in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, but Barr says so far, he has been given no reason to question the findings of the Medical Examiner who ruled Epstein's death a suicide. Bill Barr says investigation is moving forward -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: What a story. Trace Gallagher, thanks a lot for that. Well, Dr. Robert Epstein is a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology. He has also been a major critic of Google, one of the smarter critics of Google. He has argued persuasively that the company's bias may have boosted Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. That's not just something he thinks. He has amassed quite a bit of research to suggest it's true.</p><p>Epstein's arguments recently triggered a political spat between Hillary Clinton and President Trump on Twitter. Clinton bashed Epstein and his work and called it quote \"debunked.\" The interesting thing is that Dr. Epstein has been a long supporter of the Clintons, but he says Hillary's recent behavior has been quote, \"shameful.\" Dr. Epstein joins us tonight to clear up this counter tone. Doctor, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>Now, I just want to just restate, as you've told us a number of times on the show you're not a political conservative, and you've actually been a fan of Hillary Clinton's. But tell us how you assess her response to the President on your research?</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: Well, first of all, President Trump made a couple of minor errors in his tweet, in which he was referring to my research and my testimony before Congress a few weeks ago. So okay, he made some minor errors. But what Hillary Clinton did, I mean, to be honest with you, I think she should be ashamed of herself. It's absolutely outrageous. I mean, she told some blatant lies, and I happen to know that the information that she got came from Google.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that should give us pause. So basically, what you're saying, you're alleging is that Hillary Clinton is carrying water for Google?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, there's no question about it. You know, if you just look back in time a little bit, you'll find that her number one donor in 2016, was Alphabet. Google, her Chief Technology Officer, Stephanie Hannon was a former Google Executive. Eric Schmidt, the Head of Google, offered in writing to head up her tech campaign and then set up a secretive organization called the Groundwork, the sole purpose of which was to put her into office.</p><p>Now, I've been a staunch supporter of the Clintons for decades. I literally have a signed letter from Bill Clinton over my desk on the wall, and I cannot believe that she did this, and the things she is saying are just absurd.</p><p>CARLSON: So without getting too technical, I mean, you are a research scientist in effect. So it would be easy to confuse us -- me. But give us a sense of how she has lied about you.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, number one, she says my work has been debunked. That's blatantly false. My work has always adhered to the very highest standards of scientific integrity. The monitoring projects I set up now, that's not scientific research. Those are monitoring projects. And I'm the only one who has done them so far. And the purpose of those, of course is to capture what Big Tech companies like Google are showing people on our screens.</p><p>And you know, she says -- and here's the second lie -- she says that my entire monitoring project in 2016 was based on 21 undecided voters. Actually, my discovery of the bias that occurred -- the pro-Clinton bias that occurred in Google search results, not in Bing or Yahoo, by the way, just Google.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>EPSTEIN: That analysis came because I preserved 13,207 election related searches, and the 98,000 web pages to which the search results linked. So this was a big sophisticated analysis. It was the first ever of its kind. I did an even bigger project, bigger monitoring project in 2018, also with startling results about bias in Google's search results.</p><p>And I'm heading towards setting up a much, much larger system in 2020 that will look at all kinds of things --</p><p>CARLSON: Good.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Bias in news feeds and Twitter, I mean, shadow banning and many, many other things. So I am really --</p><p>CARLSON: And I hope you get the funding you need for that. And I just want to say for the third time that the results of your research contravened your own political beliefs, and you publicize them anyway. And that's what integrity looks like, and I just want to thank you for that. Dr. Epstein, thanks for coming on tonight.</p><p>EPSTEIN: Thank you, sir.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, a secretive Chinese lab -- we're not making this up -- is working to create human primate hybrids. Dr. Marc Siegel will help us investigate all the ways that could go horribly wrong for mankind itself. That's next.</p><p>CARLSON: Earlier this month, news broke that researchers in China have created a human monkey hybrid embryo -- a series of them. Now officially, scientists say they hope to be able to grow new human organs on demand, potentially inside animal bodies. But the obvious question is, what could go wrong? Well, a lot it turns out. Dr. Marc Siegel is a Fox medical contributor, a frequent guest to the show, and he joins us tonight. So doctor, give us a quick overview of what they're trying to do and why.</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CONTRIBUTOR: So scientist Juan Carlos Izpisua, who is at the Salk Institute in California flies over to China, and he knows that he is going to be able to evade regulations, Tucker, and that's a big part of this, and he takes a monkey embryo and imbues it with human stem cells, saying that he's going to be able to create organs that could be used in the future for transplant.</p><p>It's a press release science. There's no ethics involved to it. And you know what the worst thing is? Scientifically, it's impossible, because monkeys are too small. So even if you were able to grow a live monkey with human stem cells, you wouldn't have organs that were usable. It's a disgrace.</p><p>So I want to say up top that I don't believe that this scientist should be allowed to conduct research in the United States. We've seen enough of this from China already. And it's not the direction, never mind that we're using embryonic stem cells, basically throwing them away on useless science -- on rogue science.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SIEGEL: We're creating monstrosities out of it. Right now, I want to reassure our viewers, those monstrosities could not grow into full hybrids or chimeras. We're nowhere near the technology for that. But in the future, we could see science fiction out of this. In the meantime, it's an utter disgrace.</p><p>CARLSON: So you're saying it's basically quack science.</p><p>SIEGEL: Completely. I want to show you what the real science is, by the way. We have 3D printers that can make organs that we're going to use for transplant at NYU.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>SIEGEL: At NYU, we're taking pig organs and we're humanizing them using genetic engineering, not embryos, not embryonic stem cells, literally genetic editors can overcome immune problems to make organs that we can then use. Notice I said pigs, because they're more the size we need. Monkeys are not useful in this regard. Again, it's absolutely disgraceful. And I don't believe we should be conducting this kind of research.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, that's a strong -- that's a strong statement coming from a physician. It raises the question of the amount of biotech that's being funded right now in the United States, and particularly in Asia, China. That's not regulated at all. And at some point, if you've got people tampering with the basic building blocks of life, do you risk like a real tragedy happening?</p><p>SIEGEL: Yes. And I think that that's going to happen in the future. That's a great point. Now, the funding for this horrible research is coming out of Spain, it is crossing over to the United States, then it's going to China.</p><p>Right now, we have immunological problems, and a lot of differences between different species, even primates, even among primates. But in the future, we could see a science fiction movie out of this, where we create a monster, where we create a monkey that has human engrams or human thoughts, that's the direction we want to be going and it's horrible.</p><p>That's the kind of science fiction we don't need to wake up on a planet decades in the future, and you know, the movie I'm talking about where the person that's talking to us isn't a person. This is absolutely monstrous, this science.</p><p>Again, we have real science for organs. This isn't it. We need to use beings that are the same size of humans that have useful organs that we can use, not monkeys. Stay away from monkeys, please.</p><p>CARLSON: Boy, I've been on TV a long time. And I can't -- I don't think I've spent three minutes in the last 20 years calling for the regulation of anything. But if there's anything you're going to regulate, it's this kind of behavior, because it seems to me because the consequences potentially are overwhelming.</p><p>SIEGEL: We need the international community and the United States should not allow this stuff to go on at all.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. Dr. Siegel, thank you for that.</p><p>SIEGEL: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I appreciate it. We're out of time. Unfortunately, an hour goes awfully fast. We will be back tomorrow night, 8:00 p.m., the show that is the sworn and totally sincere enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink, all of which are in overabundance right now. Keep the faith, it'll get better. Goodnight from Washington.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019082101cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WW3-D1Y1-JB20-G53P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7812\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 21, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Homelessness</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Crimes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Electoral College</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bill de Blasio</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Green New Deal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jeffrey Epstein</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Microsoft</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hilary Clinton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Constitutional Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Electoral College</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDc1ODBFQkRGMTgxNDU1RkI0ODNDQTAyNDk0QzBEMjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkU1RUMwMTVEOUNENERDRUE1QjJBRkYyMUIwRTk3RUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Scott Applewhite In a document obtained by Axios, Democratic senator Mark Warner outlined ways of improving regulation of big tech in the US. Warner suggests that making laws similar to the EU's GDPR regulations could be one way of improving privacy rules. Other suggestions made in the document includemaking tech firms identify and label bots. </p><p>Senator Mark Warner's office has laid outlined ways for US policymakers to bring big tech to heel following Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. In a 23-page document obtained by Axios[1] \u2014 prepared by Warner's staff and reportedly circulated in tech policy circles \u2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee vice chairman has devised policy proposals around combating disinformation, protecting user privacy, and promoting competition tech. With regards to protecting user privacy, Warner suggests that the US adopt data legislation similar to Europe's recent GDPR regulations. He identifies key parts of GDPR which could be copied such as data portability, the right to be forgotten, 72-hour breach notification, and first party consent. First party consent, in particular, is singled out as a feature of GDPR that the US could adopt, with a view to preventing third parties from obtaining people's data \"without their explicit and informed consent.\" However, the report also says that a singular emphasis on user consent could be \"nave,\" and that an effort would also have to be made to crack down on \"dark patterns\"[2] which are used to manipulate users. The document notes that a US central authority would have to be created to enforce any GDPR-like regulation, as while EU member states have their own privacy regulators, the US is lacking any equivalent authority. It also notes that GDPR \"may take too extreme a view of what constitutes personal data,\" as domain registration information falls under that remit. Mimicking GDPR is only one of many suggestions put forward in the document. It also proposes that web platforms could be legally obliged to identify and label bots, and that there be a public initiative to introduce \"media literacy\" into the education system. Many of the policies outlined in the paper are ambitious and sweeping, but as the Democrats hold neither house it is unlikely that we'll see any of them implemented in the near future.You can read the full document[3] on Axios[4].

John Hickenlooper[1] mentioned when he launched his presidential bid in a 20-minute speech at Civic Center Park wasn't a policy idea he was proposing or a person he had helped, but a location.Hickenlooper, who parlayed his ownership of a popular brewery into becoming mayor of the Mile High City and then governor of the state, boasted he was delivering the speech 'against the backdrop of the American Rockies,' he said, 'in the heart of the American West.'There are plenty of reasons Hickenlooper is an unlikely candidate - he's perhaps too moderate for the modern Democratic Party, he's little known outside of Colorado, and he's a white man when the party's primary electorates are increasingly picking women and people of color as their nominees.But the way Hickenlooper would most stand out from past Democratic presidential contenders? Simple geography. As a Coloradan, Hickenlooper hails from the West. </p><p>No politician representing the region has ever become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee.(President Barack Obama was born in Hawaii, but represented Illinois in the Senate.)Even candidates from the western part of the country have been rare. In the four open Democratic presidential primaries this century - in 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2016 - just two candidates from the West have run: former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel. The last western candidate to receive delegate votes at the Democratic National Convention? Former California Gov. Jerry Brown back in 1992.In 2020, thanks to a more wide-open field than the party has seen in decades, that's changing. The party's center of power is beginning to shift from New York and New England into the rapidly growing Mountain West states and ultra-populous, uber-diverse California. Four Democrats from the West have already entered the race, and three more are considering it. The Democratic Party's center of power is beginning to shift from New York and New England into the rapidly growing Mountain West states and ultra-populous, uber-diverse California. There's a pair of Californians: Sen. Kamala Harris \u2014 one of the top contenders for the nomination \u2014 and Rep. Eric Swalwell. There are two Mountain West governors: Hickenlooper and Steve Bullock of Montana. In the Pacific Northwest, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee has launched a climate-focused bid.Another Coloradan, Sen. Michael Bennet, has been touring the early primary voting states. And America's westernmost state, Hawaii, is contributing a candidate in Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. (Other potential candidates from the West, including megadonor Tom Steyer of California and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, have decided against running.)'I think for too long, the party has ignored the West,' Richardson told HuffPost in a phone interview. 'We've been a bicoastal or even northeastern party. That hasn't worked well; we've lost.'(A brief methodological aside: HuffPost is using the U.S. Census Bureau's 11-state definition of the West, which does not include Texas. But much of the analysis here could also apply to two Texans: former Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who has not declared if he's running, and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julin Castro, who has.)So many candidates from west of the Rocky Mountains are running thanks to a host of factors this cycle, including a wide-open field and the belief that the general election may be ready for something different than the 2016 race, which gave the country a choice of two candidates from the New York City area.Here's why we're seeing so many Democratic presidential candidates from the West:1) No clear front-runner. Unlike in 2016, there's no clear person with the edge, which has led to more candidates of all stripes.'Last cycle, we saw a coronation,' said Dave Jacobson, a Democratic consultant in California, referring to Hillary Clinton's relatively easy primary win. 'Now, people want the complete opposite of that.'2) Change in the primary schedule. The second major change contributing to more western candidates was California's decision to move its primary from June to early March, making it one of the first states to vote after the big four early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.'In the past, the presidential calendar has favored candidates with financial strength, with population strength, because of the early primaries,' said Richardson, whose campaign fizzled after the early states of Iowa and New Hampshire. 'Now that the calendar has shifted, western candidates have a shot.'3) Democratization of fundraising. It used to help candidates to have strong ties to the traditional Democratic fundraising bases in Washington, D.C., New York, Boston and Chicago. But with the rise of small-dollar online donations, candidates with geographic bases far from the East Coast can raise the money necessary to compete.4) A growing, diverse electorate in the West. The party is gaining strength in the West, fueled by booming populations of young, college-educated and Hispanic residents - the population of the region is now just two-thirds non-Hispanic white. More than one-quarter of the House seats that Democrats took from Republican control in 2018 were from the West, as were both the Senate seats Democrats won from the GOP.In the past two years, Democrats picked up total control of four state governments in the region: Washington state, New Mexico, Nevada and Colorado. The latter three states were swing states not long ago, but all three have a deep blue tint today, and Democrats view Arizona's desert as fertile ground in which to grow the party.And that means Democrats coming from the region \u2015 especially Harris, who came through the progressive crucible of Bay Area politics before winning three statewide elections in California \u2015 are practiced at appealing both to diverse electorates and the party's left wing.'They had to climb the ranks in a very tough system within their own party,' Law said. 'Once you make it through that crucible, you're very formidable.' I think for too long, the party has ignored the West. We've been a bicoastal or even northeastern party. That hasn't worked well; we've lost.Former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson Harris is seen as one of the front-runners in large part because of her success in appealing to African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and progressives. All of these groups will be key voting blocs in both California and the early caucus state of Nevada. And Harris' time in Sacramento and San Francisco has given her plenty of experience navigating intraparty battles between progressives and moderates.'You have a state on the cutting edge of innovation, in both technology and in policy-making. And it's been that way for a very long time. California's always pushing the envelope,' Law said. 'The debate going on within the Democratic Party now is what happens in California all the time.'But the other western candidates also believe they have something they can teach their counterparts on the East Coast, often citing the region as more optimistic and independent than the rest of the country. 'There's a lot Washington can learn from Colorado,' former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb said while introducing Hickenlooper to the 4,000-strong crowd in Denver.In Hickenlooper's telling, he fostered a spirit of bipartisanship in the state while also improving Denver's mass transit, expanding Medicaid, passing universal background checks for gun purchases and implementing new environmental regulations.'I think the West has always had a special place in the soul of America. People talk about the frontiersman, the fur trappers. What they forget about is that the fur-trappers rarely went out on their own, they went out in teams,' Hickenlooper said in an interview when he was still considering a bid late last year. 'There's a history of collaboration out here. There were a heck of a lot more barn-raisings than there ever were shootouts.'Hickenlooper's launch event was seemingly designed to show off his ability to appeal to every corner of the West: The speakers before him included Webb, who is black, along with Keith Bath, a white self-described 'dirt farmer' from rural Colorado, and the Rev. Luca Guzmn, a Latina who led Colorado's Senate Democrats when Hickenlooper was in office.There are some potential drawbacks to coming from the West. Progressive voters increasingly view big tech, one of the region's highest-profile industries, as monopolistic actors with little respect for consumer protections or privacy. But Inslee wasn't willing to join the wave of criticism against two of Washington state's biggest private employers.'I think the tech industry, in terms of what it's done for lives, has been spectacular,' he told HuffPost in an interview, citing the jobs Amazon and Microsoft have created in his home state. He added later that Facebook and other social media companies need to be 'reined in' on the privacy front and said it should be harder for giant corporations like Amazon to 'extort' local governments for tax breaks.One thing Inslee was adamant about? It's time for a Democrat to join two famous Republicans as the only presidents to have represented the West.'We just simply cannot allow the only presidents from the West Coast to be [Ronald] Reagan and [Richard] Nixon,' he said.

Trump economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moody's Analytics 2020 Presidential Election Model weighs the current economy, politics and voter turnout and projects a second Trump term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump's election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren't enthusiastic and don't get out to vote,\" the report's authors write.</p><p>Its model has correctly predicted every presidential result since 1980, except for 2016, when its forecast missed the mark on the Electoral College outcome. The economists have since tweaked their methodology, and will use three election models instead of one.</p><p>At the last debate, you did not hear the Democrats on the stage demolishing Trump's branding of the economy. Sure, they tackled regulating and even breaking up big tech companies. But no new ground was forged there.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, sharing new front-runner status, was hammered (and she dodged) about whether the middle class would pay higher taxes for Medicare for All. Senator Bernie Sanders said they would, but would make up for it with lower health care costs.</p><p>Asked about the threat of automation obliterating jobs over the next decade, Warren blamed bad trade deals, while tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang touted his \"freedom dividend,\" implementing a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month, and Sanders pushed an infrastructure plan that he says would employ 15 million people.</p><p>Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer hit on income inequality and taxing \"the billionaire class.\" And Steyer said he would \"undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.\"</p><p>Sen Amy Klobuchar vowed to repeal tax reform and slammed the president's character. \"...Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-A-Lago, got together with his cronies and said 'Guess what? You guys all got a lot richer,'\" she said. \"That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.\"</p><p>It's a potentially powerful line of attack for Democrats. The president's corporate tax cut just didn't have the sizzle the president promised. Signed into law December 2017, GDP has struggled to stay above 3 percent for more than a quarter. Track it here.</p><p>Companies used their newfound largesse to buy back shares of their stock. That benefits shareholders, not necessarily the public. It was not the rocket-fuel to GDP that the president and his team promised.</p><p/><p>In a lost opportunity, the Democrats didn't address the president's trade war with China and what they would do to either end it or keep the pressure on the Chinese. (In fact, the only China attack was Sanders against former Vice President Joe Biden's record on free-trade agreements.) Nor did they question the president's hyperbole and exaggeration on how good American economy is.</p><p>Just yesterday the International Monetary Fund forecast weaker global growth next year and predicts US that growth will continue to slow. Rising trade and geopolitical tensions has put economies in a \"precarious\" position. We're talking the slowest global growth since the financial crisis.</p><p/><p>The US ? faring better than most ? has a target growth of 2.1 percent for 2020, the IMF said.</p><p>But folks, this is hardly the 4 percent growth the president promised from his tax cuts and deregulation. (At his most hyperbolic he promised 6 percent GDP.) This is slower than the even 2.4 percent the IMF still expects for 2019.</p><p>What's wrong? Trump's trade war, for one. Businesses spend less and invest less when they don't have a clear picture of the future. The presidenet's trade \"deal\" last week with the Chinese is nothing more than an agreement to prevent mutually-assured destruction. Tariffs are still in place, with another tariff deadline looming in December.</p><p>And we have no idea if the Chinese will live up to their promises on IP and currency. (In fact, the agreement is not even in writing yet.) A plus for the president politically, is that the Chinese are buying US agricultural products, but that isn't necessarily news, given that purchases began in August.</p><p>At the debate, the Democrats focused their fire on each other, or more broadly on the president's fitness for office and the impeachment inquiry. They failed to point out the irony of arguing over how expensive Medicare for All would be, when Trump Administration tax cuts and huge government spending are ballooning the budget deficit and piling up the national debt.</p><p>The president has proven masterful at controlling the message, using his microphone and Twitter account to exaggerate success. Just 24 hours ago, the president tweeted about median household income figures. \"Just out\" he declared. \"Median household income it's at the highest point ever...in the history of our country.\" \"Tough numbers for the Radical Left.\"</p><p>Facts are not so important to his narrative. For example, that report came out a month ago and household income growth was statistically unchanged from last year, which by the government's own analysis was just above $64,000.</p><p>Obviously with a Democratic field so big--12 candidates on stage!--each candidate is trying to break free from the rest. And that leaves the president to continue branding the economy on his own terms.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Trump economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moody's Analytics 2020 Presidential Election Model weighs the current economy, politics and voter turnout and projects a second Trump term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump's election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren't enthusiastic and don't get out to vote,\" the report's authors write.</p><p>Its model has correctly predicted every presidential result since 1980, except for 2016, when its forecast missed the mark on the Electoral College outcome. The economists have since tweaked their methodology, and will use three election models instead of one. </p><p>At the last debate, you did not hear the Democrats on the stage demolishing Trump's branding of the economy. Sure, they tackled regulating and even breaking up big tech companies. But no new ground was forged there.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, sharing new front-runner status, was hammered (and she dodged) about whether the middle class would pay higher taxes for Medicare for All. Senator Bernie Sanders said they would, but would make up for it with lower health care costs.</p><p>Asked about the threat of automation obliterating jobs over the next decade, Warren blamed bad trade deals, while tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang touted his \"freedom dividend,\" implementing a Universal Basic Income of $1,000 a month, and Sanders pushed an infrastructure plan that he says would employ 15 million people. </p><p>Sanders and billionaire Tom Steyer hit on income inequality and taxing \"the billionaire class.\" And Steyer said he would \"undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations.\"</p><p>Sen Amy Klobuchar vowed to repeal tax reform and slammed the president's character. \"...Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-A-Lago, got together with his cronies and said 'Guess what? You guys all got a lot richer,'\" she said. \"That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.\"</p><p>It's a potentially powerful line of attack for Democrats. The president's corporate tax cut just didn't have the sizzle the president promised. Signed into law December 2017, GDP has struggled to stay above 3 percent for more than a quarter. Track it here. </p><p>Companies used their newfound largesse to buy back shares of their stock. That benefits shareholders, not necessarily the public. It was not the rocket-fuel to GDP that the president and his team promised.</p><p>In a lost opportunity, the Democrats didn't address the president's trade war with China and what they would do to either end it or keep the pressure on the Chinese. (In fact, the only China attack was Sanders against former Vice President Joe Biden's record on free-trade agreements.) Nor did they question the president's hyperbole and exaggeration on how good American economy is.</p><p>Just yesterday the International Monetary Fund forecast weaker global growth next year and predicts US that growth will continue to slow. Rising trade and geopolitical tensions has put economies in a \"precarious\" position. We're talking the slowest global growth since the financial crisis.</p><p>The US --- faring better than most --- has a target growth of 2.1 percent for 2020, the IMF said. </p><p>But folks, this is hardly the 4 percent growth the president promised from his tax cuts and deregulation. (At his most hyperbolic he promised 6 percent GDP.) This is slower than the even 2.4 percent the IMF still expects for 2019.</p><p>What's wrong? Trump's trade war, for one. Businesses spend less and invest less when they don't have a clear picture of the future. The presidenet's trade \"deal\" last week with the Chinese is nothing more than an agreement to prevent mutually-assured destruction. Tariffs are still in place, with another tariff deadline looming in December. </p><p>And we have no idea if the Chinese will live up to their promises on IP and currency. (In fact, the agreement is not even in writing yet.) A plus for the president politically, is that the Chinese are buying US agricultural products, but that isn't necessarily news, given that purchases began in August. </p><p>At the debate, the Democrats focused their fire on each other, or more broadly on the president's fitness for office and the impeachment inquiry. They failed to point out the irony of arguing over how expensive Medicare for All would be, when Trump Administration tax cuts and huge government spending are ballooning the budget deficit and piling up the national debt.</p><p>The president has proven masterful at controlling the message, using his microphone and Twitter account to exaggerate success. Just 24 hours ago, the president tweeted about median household income figures. \"Just out\" he declared. \"Median household income it's at the highest point ever...in the history of our country.\" \"Tough numbers for the Radical Left.\" </p><p>Facts are not so important to his narrative. For example, that report came out a month ago and household income growth was statistically unchanged from last year, which by the government's own analysis was just above $64,000.</p><p>Obviously with a Democratic field so big--12 candidates on stage!--each candidate is trying to break free from the rest. And that leaves the president to continue branding the economy on his own terms.</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

After Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote an May 9 op-ed calling for Facebook to be broken up and CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be removed, Democrats started echoing the sentiment. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden told the Associated Press that breaking up Facebook, as well as other large tech companies, 'is something we should take a really hard look at.' </p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)[1] has been advocating for the break-up of Big Tech since she began campaigning. Warren said in a March 8 op-ed, 'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.' On May 12, Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA)[2] told CNN's Jake Tapper that Facebook was 'essentially a utility.' 'It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I'm concerned that's gotta stop,' she continued. Other Democratic candidates, perhaps still hopeful for a campaign check from tech companies, have advocated regulation, but not as severe as the breakup proposed by Biden, Warren and Harris. SenatorCory Booker (D-NJ), a favorite of tech companies, told ABC's This Week[3] on May 12: 'I don't think that a president should be running around, pointing at companies and saying 'break them up' without any kind of process here. It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, 'I'm going to break up you guys.' No. We need to create systems and processes.'' Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg went to Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes, but wasn't as interested in breaking up the company. He proposed 'a spectrum of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies.' Former Texas Democratic CongressmanBeto O'Rourke[4], who failed to wrestle a Senate seat away from Republican Ted Cruz, also favored increased regulation rather than breaking up the company. 'I'm not sure if having five more Facebooks \u2014 if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies -makes as much sense as regulating them, given the power they have and the way in which they can be used to undermine our democracy and affect the outcomes of our elections,' O'Rourke said on March 21 to CNBC. It seems like regulation at the very least is on the table for Facebook \u2014 if Democrats have their way. Julia A.

Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden told the Associated Press that breaking up Facebook, as well as other large tech companies, 'is something we should take a really hard look at.'Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)[1] has been advocating for the break-up of Big Tech since she began campaigning. Warren said in a March 8 op-ed, 'To restore the balance of power in our democracy, to promote competition, and to ensure that the next generation of technology innovation is as vibrant as the last, it's time to break up our biggest tech companies.'On May 12, Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA)[2] told CNN's Jake Tapper that Facebook was 'essentially a utility.''It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. </p><p>And as far as I'm concerned that's gotta stop,' she continued.Other Democratic candidates, perhaps still hopeful for a campaign check from tech companies, have advocated regulation, but not as severe as the breakup proposed by Biden, Warren and Harris.SenatorCory Booker (D-NJ), a favorite of tech companies, told ABC's This Week[3] on May 12: 'I don't think that a president should be running around, pointing at companies and saying 'break them up' without any kind of process here. It's not me and my own personal opinion about going after folks. That sounds more like a Donald Trump thing to say, 'I'm going to break up you guys.' No. We need to create systems and processes.''Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg went to Harvard with Mark Zuckerberg and Chris Hughes, but wasn't as interested in breaking up the company. He proposed 'a spectrum of regulation that could include fines, blocking new mergers or splitting up companies.'Former Texas Democratic CongressmanBeto O'Rourke[4], who failed to wrestle a Senate seat away from Republican Ted Cruz, also favored increased regulation rather than breaking up the company.'I'm not sure if having five more Facebooks -- if you broke up Facebook into five component parts, or any of these other large social media or technology companies --makes as much sense as regulating them, given the power they have and the way in which they can be used to undermine our democracy and affect the outcomes of our elections,' O'Rourke said on March 21 to CNBC.It seems like regulation at the very least is on the table for Facebook   if Democrats have their way.

STEVE SCALISE (R-LA): Thanks. It'll be a lot of fun. Appreciate the interest and God bless America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MACCALLUM: You bet. Thank you, sir. That is THE STORY on baseball and debate night. We're going to be back here tomorrow night at seven. Tucker is coming up next. Good night, everybody.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Konichiwa and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Tonight, we are coming to you live from Kyoto, Japan. We're sitting in front of the Hozu River, really one of the prettiest places in the world. This was for more than a thousand years the capital -- the Imperial Capital -- of Japan before it moved to Tokyo.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're here because the G20 Summit in just a few days will be coming to Osaka nearby. We will be interviewing the President. You'll see it right here.</p><p>But first tonight, the Democratic debate, less than an hour from now. A dozen candidates are so, 10 Democrats will take the stage. Some of them potentially could become President. Many others: Bill de Blasio, Cory Booker are merely making fools of themselves for reasons that aren't exactly clear.</p><p>But it's interesting to see them all gathered together because you get a sense of what the Democratic Party cares about, what its priorities are. And this season, the candidates will be trying hard to become the most extreme on the question of immigration, which one can attack the idea of borders most aggressively?</p><p>Keep in mind it was only a few months ago that as a group, they were telling you there was no crisis at all on the border. In fact, they were saying it was manufactured by the Trump administration. Remember? Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHUCK TODD, MSNBC HOST: Folks, the President has manufactured one heck of a political crisis for himself.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Donald Trump is manufacturing a national security crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You will hear them say, this is a manufactured crisis. It's not a national security crisis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: From Nancy Pelosi down to Debbie Wasserman-Schultz or anybody else who will give him a dime for this project.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because it is manufactured.</p><p>JOE LOCKHART, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It's a manufactured crisis for the President to get a political win.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have a President and who will go on TV tonight and lie and lie and like some more. This is a manufactured crisis.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Shills and liars and dumb people. Joe Lockhart coming out of retirement to lie to you, \"It's a manufactured crisis.\" That wasn't true then, it's definitely not true now. A hundred thousand people estimated to be streaming into this country illegally every month, many from as far away as Africa. The crisis is not manufactured. It's demonstrably real. Even Democrats recognize that now.</p><p>But now they're saying it's not their fault, of course, they're blaming the President. This week a man and his daughter drowned trying to cross the Rio Grande River which creates our southern border. Beto O'Rourke, a participant in tonight's debate tweeted this quote, \"The President is responsible for these deaths.\" This is the man who said we should have no border barrier whatsoever.</p><p>The Press instantly adopted Beto's view as their own. Watch them repeat his sentiments.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS HAYES, MSNBC HOST: This administration's mix of cruelty and incompetence continues day by day to exacerbate a humanitarian crisis at the border.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Resulting in the suffering of children and infants, as the President and his administration concoct a toxic brew of political opportunism and operational competence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Children who live there today and tonight should not have to shoulder the political dysfunction and the administration's policies that have created the situation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: What you just saw isn't shading the truth, it is not bending the truth, it's lying right to your face and daring you to disagree. It's the definition of propaganda.</p><p>Thousands of people cross our border every single day illegally. Why? Because word has gotten out that our immigration laws will not be enforced. It's not the President who decided not to enforce them. He was elected to enforce them. No, it's the Democratic Party, which has staked its entire political future on the dysfunction you're watching right now on importing a new class of voters to replace the American middle class, which it no longer serves or cares about.</p><p>Its Democrats who erected sanctuary cities. It's Democrats who halted deportations. It's Democrats who are telling you even today, we have to shut down I.C.E.</p><p>Not everything about the Democratic Party is bad. Not everything they say is a lie. But when they tell you that it's Trump's fault that the border is out of control. That is a lie. It is a hundred percent their fault. They created the status quo that is causing deaths suffered by migrants.</p><p>But don't take it from us. Five years ago, President Obama admitted that dysfunctional borders lead to suffering. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Our message absolutely is don't send your children unaccompanied on trains or through a bunch of smugglers. We don't even know how many of these kids don't make it. They may have been waylaid into sex trafficking or killed because they fell off a train. We have no way of tracking that.</p><p>So that is our direct message to the families in Central America. Do not send your children to the borders. If they do make it, they'll get sent back. More importantly, they may not make it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Says Barack Obama telling illegal aliens not to come and not to put their children in harm's way trying to sneak in. Can you imagine? He is a Democrat, by the way, in case you don't remember. He held office just three years ago.</p><p>Try saying that today. Anyone who even had those thoughts would be considered a thought criminal. Obama would be too far-right wing to stand on tonight's debate stage, he actually would be scorned by his fellow Republicans, by the way, if he were a Republican. Things have changed a lot.</p><p>Ed Henry is in Miami for tonight's debate. He joins us tonight with some perspective on this question. Hey, Ed.</p><p>ED HENRY, FOX NEWS CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Tucker, good to see you. It's fascinating. You're right, because among the 10 Democrats on stage tonight, none of them are saying what Barack Obama said, which is that at least parents have some responsibility for what is happening at the border, the kids that are coming across.</p><p>Back in 2014, it was about unaccompanied minors. The photo you're talking about that is captured, though with less attention right now. And it should capture everyone's attention, because the tragedy that a father and daughter die, but no one among these Democrats on stage tonight are talking about the father's responsibility, parents in general.</p><p>And I'll take it a step further. At least two Democrats on stage tonight, you mentioned beta O'Rourke, as well as Cory Booker, they both served in Congress. O'Rourke, a former House member; Booker, a current senator. They're both out tonight, blaming the President for the death of this father and daughter when they have been and were in Congress and did virtually nothing about the border crisis.</p><p>I will say, Cory Booker, at least a few months ago, we checked the record, he did say it's a crisis and his party should not deny it's a crisis. But in fact, when you look at it, Nancy Pelosi called it a fake crisis. Chuck Schumer said it's a crisis that does not exist.</p><p>And then look at people in the media. Don Lemon on CNN, back a few months ago, said this was an imaginary Latin American conspiracy, put together by the President. Well, last night, Don Lemon was holding up this photo that you showed a moment ago on CNN and saying, \"Anyone who wants to deny it's a crisis, I'll show you this photo.\" Anyone like Don Lemon? Or Nancy Pelosi? Or Chuck Schumer? They've all denied previously that it was a crisis.</p><p>CARLSON: So they're betting, I guess, that nobody else in America can remember what the world was like three months ago, or what they said three months ago.</p><p>HENRY: Right. And part of it is that you now have this debate in Congress and House Republicans bear some responsibility. Let's remember they ran the House the first two years of Donald Trump's administration. They didn't follow through on the wall. They didn't follow through on a lot of pieces. They did some of it, but there's a whole bunch of they didn't follow up on, right? So you have that issue on the table.</p><p>So now, Byron York was pointing this out today. You have Democrats and Republicans in Congress fighting about a few billion dollars to deal with the border crisis. Everyone should admit now it's a crisis as the President from declared it.</p><p>They're fighting over a few billion dollars to deal with this crisis, and yet we have thousands of people crossing illegally every day, and while they fight, there's nothing that they're doing.</p><p>By the way, Cory Booker who is on stage tonight, he is going even further. He wants to decriminalize the idea of crossing the border illegally. How exactly will that work? So if you come here illegally, he as President is going to say, \"I'm decriminalizing that. You could break our laws. It's okay.\"</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, and here's universal healthcare which you can now participate in. Yes. That's the end of the country right there. Ed Henry, thank you for being the institutional memory on that question. Really amazing. Good to see you.</p><p>Mark Morgan is the current acting Director of I.C.E. and he joins us tonight. Mr. Morgan, thanks very much for coming on. So it does seem like the Democratic Party has woken up to the fact it's a crisis, but now it's the President's fault. What's your response?</p><p>MARK MORGAN, ACTING I.C.E. DIRECTOR: Yes, again, Tucker, this is just outrageous. How long have we been talking about it? The experts, the people who do this every single day that risk their lives, we've been out there pleading Congress that they need to step up.</p><p>The only dysfunctional thing is Congress, their inability to do what we've been begging them to do, to fix the Flores Settlement Agreement, so we don't release families into the United States. TVPRA which allows us that we are forced -- kids from the northern triangle countries, we have to let in the United States.</p><p>We've told them, that's the incentive. That's the pull factor. If they pass meaningful legislation to fix those two things that would end catch and release and Tucker, I'm promising the American people, the numbers would skyrocket down and Congress refuses to do their job.</p><p>CARLSON: That's very, very obvious. So this is an ominous sign or it seems like -- well, I want to run this by you. Nicaraguan police say they've arrested and deported four suspected members of ISIS -- two Egyptians and two Iraqis, reportedly came to Costa Rica earlier this month and were caught after several after a previous alert by U.S. Department of Homeland Security coming into Nicaragua. What is this about? Do you have any sense?</p><p>MORGAN: I do and Tucker, I'm glad you brought this up. Because here's another narrative. We went from, it's a manufactured crisis to now they'll admit it's a crisis but only a humanitarian crisis? Well, it's not. That's why the President declared a national emergency because it's a humanitarian crisis and a national security threat crisis as well. And this is a great example.</p><p>And this is where Homeland Security Investigations, HSI, the investigative element of I.C.E., this is where they're pushing the borders out. They are working with other countries, and they've come up with these great systems where when we get an alert on somebody, these countries, we're helping them do biometrics on these people and we're identifying who they are well before they get anywhere near our borders to do damage. And in this case, that's exactly what they did.</p><p>Now, it came out -- we call it \"no derog.\" So there wasn't any derogatory information about these individuals. So right now, we don't have any connections to terrorist groups or terrorist activities. But that's not the point. The American people should realize that that bad things, bad people could potentially come through that southwest border and this is a great example of that.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, but as soon as they get here, they get driver's licenses. No, I'm laughing because it's so completely absurd. Mark Morgan, thanks very much for perspective on that.</p><p>MORGAN: You bet.</p><p>CARLSON: Young pioneer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a member of Congress, but would make a fantastic Bolshevik if she decides to change careers. It's not enough she is telling us to oppose the President's immigration policies.</p><p>We also need to destroy anyone who even remotely connected to securing the border. E-commerce company, Wayfair is providing beds for a new immigrant holding facility in Texas. Today, some employees walked out in protest of that.</p><p>Ocasio- Cortez endorsed their efforts. She tweeted this quote, \"This is what solidarity looks like.\" Maybe next, she will boycott the snack foods that I.C.E. stocks in vending machines.</p><p>Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, is entering tonight's debate with a fresh proposal to completely decriminalize illegal border crossings, which is, of course completely insane. Sneaking into America legally would no longer be illegal. What would happen to the country if we did that?</p><p>Melissa Francis cohosts \"Outnumbered\" as well as \"After the Bell\" on Fox Business. We're always grateful to have her on the show. Melissa, thanks for coming on. So first to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. What do you make of this? She is saying that anybody who does business with I.C.E. in effect should be punished.</p><p>MELISSA FRANCIS, FOX BUSINESS HOST: I mean, it's idiotic. The CEO -- Wayfair is a public company first of all, they're losing money. Their CEO doesn't get to make decisions like that. He has a legal fiduciary responsibility to do best with the shareholders money. It's not his money.</p><p>He can't make decisions based on his own politics or his own definition of morality. He has to try to make money for his shareholders. It's against the law for him to do what she wants him to do, to turn down business, especially given the fact that the company is losing money.</p><p>Now let's talk about the Elizabeth Warren and this other proposal that we're going to hear more about tonight at those debates, if you tune in, where they're saying if you cross the border, it shouldn't be illegal.</p><p>Guess what? If somebody is coming here to seek asylum, it's because the rule of law in their home country has broken down to the point where they no longer feel safe.</p><p>They are coming to this country, because the rule of law works and keeps them safe. So how is breaking the law helping those people who are coming here for laws and security? These are both really stupid ideas.</p><p>How does taking away furniture help children? How does taking away laws help children? It doesn't. You know what? Our lawmakers have massively failed us. This is a huge problem that is enormous. Because it has festered for so long. There is no easy way to solve it. It's going to take a whole bunch of solutions.</p><p>And here's the thing, Tucker. I mean, what if every time we interviewed a lawmaker, what if you and I took this pledge and everybody else and Shep and Sean and Rachel and Anderson, what if we all said that every time you interview a lawmaker, you say: Name one thing you've opposed before that you're willing to give and put on the table as a gesture to get the ball rolling? You can't name what you want in return.</p><p>Because you know what? Everyone' is going to have to work together to come to a solution, and that picture of the dead child is really heartbreaking. But everybody looks at it and they see someone different to blame.</p><p>We can all look at it and see that it's total failure on the part of America. So look at that picture and ask lawmakers, what is it that you're willing to put on the table with nothing in return? You won't look weak. You look strong. What do you think? Don't you think that would work?</p><p>CARLSON: It might. I mean, I personally think that the people in charge of the country needs to first care about the country. I'm in a country now Japan, whose leaders whatever their flaws care about the country of Japan, there's no immigration to Japan, because they don't think it's good for the country. There's also no litter here and no crime.</p><p>So every priority on both sides of the divide here politically, the basic priorities are the same, which is take care of the country. I don't see almost anybody in Congress who is putting America -- literally America's interest first, at all.</p><p>FRANCIS: No, I don't think so either. I agree with you. But I think this would expose them, because I think both sides have let this problem fester, and it's become a great political thing for them. It's become a way to hit the other side.</p><p>I mean, when you have somebody proposing that anybody who comes into this country illegally, suddenly it's legal. That doesn't make any sense. So they're obviously not true trying to do anything real. They're trying to make a political point. So let's challenge them to actually fix the problem or shut up and get out of the way.</p><p>CARLSON: Amen. Melissa Francis, thanks very much for that. Just a reminder tonight, going forward, we will monitor the Democratic debates and have all the low points on tomorrow's shows so you don't have to suffer through it. We recommend you don't.</p><p>Robert Mueller wants to go into retirement. He said so in public. Democrats won't let him though. The Russia probe must continue. So he is being forced to testify. I'll tell you when and where.</p><p>Yesterday, by the way, we were broadcasting live from Tokyo and now we're along the Hozu River in a remarkable city called Kyoto, Japan. Take you to the journey, how we got here.</p><p>Our first stop Japan's famous bullet train station in Tokyo. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So we're in the Central Tokyo Train Station heading to Kyoto in the bullet train in just a minute. This is -- keep in mind the largest Metro area in the world. And the first thing you notice about this train station is what they don't have, which is filth, or graffiti. There's no trash. It's perfectly clean. No one is begging money. No one is shooting drugs. Nobody is yelling or picking imaginary insects out of the air.</p><p>This is as nice as any public space I've ever been in my life. Shocking. It'd be nice to live in a place like this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. We are live this morning because, it is morning here in Japan from Kyoto, the Old Imperial capital for a thousand years. This is where the Japanese Emperors live.</p><p>But that entire millennium, the city may have never seen anything quite as absurd as what's happening in our own capital of Washington, D.C. right now.</p><p>The Mueller report has been out for two months. If you've read it, you know that there is no evidence contained inside of it. This is the result of two years of investigation that Russia helped the Trump campaign with the knowledge of the Trump campaign. In other words, that there was collusion between the two. No collusion.</p><p>But it doesn't matter. Democrats cannot allow this story to die. It has to last until -- let's see -- November of 2020. So now Democrats are bringing Robert Mueller back next month to testify about the report. Congressman Jerry Nadler who really is -- he is a contemptible Member of Congress -- insist it won't be a waste of everyone's time. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): I think it will have a profound impact. I think it's very important that the American people hear from Mr. Mueller as what he did find, what the results of that two-year investigation were, and not have to rely on the misinformation spread by the Attorney General or in reading the report, which most people did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: John Kiriakou is a former C.I.A. officer and a frequent guest in the show. He joins us tonight. John, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>JOHN KIRIAKOU, FORMER C.I.A. OFFICER: Thanks so much for having me.</p><p>CARLSON: So you just heard Mr. Nadler say that Mr. Mueller needs an opportunity to explain what he found. But I thought he got to write the report that had no time limit and no length limit. What could he possibly tell us that wouldn't have been in the report?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Well, he is not going to tell us anything at all. He has already told us that he is not going to tell us anything at all that's not already been published in the report. What Jerry Nadler is hoping is that 99 percent of Americans have not read the report, they've relied on media to tell them what they should think, and that they're not good to go read the report now.</p><p>Now, can you imagine somebody like Robert Mueller, who has made it as far as he has made it in life by being a professional, just throwing all of that out of the window, and sitting in the witness chair and coming up with some sort of new revelation that nobody has known about that he hadn't written about? That his investigators hadn't uncovered until just now? It's never going to happen. This is only political theater and nothing more.</p><p>CARLSON: So Mueller told us when he made his one and only public appearance after the release of his report, that if called to testify, he would not say a single thing that wasn't contained in the report. Do you think it's possible he'll change that position?</p><p>KIRIAKOU: I can't imagine that he'll change that position, because then he's going to open himself up to all kinds of new criticism. Why do that?</p><p>What Robert Mueller wants is for this whole thing to just end so he can take that seven figure salary and the big corner office in some law firm somewhere and live happily ever after.</p><p>He said, and I saw this on all of the news networks in the last day or so that he only agreed to testify because he didn't want to spend the money on an attorney fighting a subpoena.</p><p>And so what he's going to do -- and I would bet a paycheck on this -- what he is going to do is he is going to sit in the witness chair, and he is going to repeat everything that he concluded in that report. We are not going to see anything new coming out of this testimony.</p><p>CARLSON: I think your point about legal fees -- as someone yourself who has been hounded for --</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Oh, yes.</p><p>CARLSON: -- by the Federal government knows very well. That's one of the ways they get is you give up because it's too expensive.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: So thank you for making that point. John, great to see you tonight.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: My pleasure. Great to see you.</p><p>CARLSON: I wish we had more time. Thank you.</p><p>KIRIAKOU: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, lawlessness continues to gain traction in the United States. Now in Queens, New York, apparently, a new DA has been elected who is committed to protecting criminals and tearing down the law. We're not overstating that. We've got details after the break.</p><p>But first more of our journey from Tokyo to get to our current location in Kyoto as we prepare for the President's arrival here in Japan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So we're at the Central Tokyo Train Station, about to board a bullet train. They are called bullet trains because they're really fast. A train like this could get between New York and Washington for example in an hour. It currently takes our fastest train three hours.</p><p>This train is going to Hiroshima right behind me and it's about to take off. They have electric engines that apparently the lift off, the G Force is intense when it starts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back. We're here in Kyoto, Japan along the banks of the Hozu River. Back in the United States, Democrats are just moments away tonight from taking the debate stage in Miami, where they're now demanding that we open our borders to the world and give healthcare to millions of foreigners. They're telling us that global warming will end the world and the Green New Deal giving them total control of the U.S. economy is the only way to save it.</p><p>For months, Democrats have been telling us this, working themselves into a frenzy, a lather of hysteria. They say things like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JULIAN CASTRO (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The biggest threat to our prosperity in this 21st Century is climate change.</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The crisis that could at its worst lead to extinction.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Climate change is real, it is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We are running out of runway to be able to fix this problem. We need all hands on deck.</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: When the planet has been in peril in the past, who came forward to save Earth from the scourge of Nazi totalitarian regimes? We came forward.</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: So if you don't take global climate change seriously, you don't care about the world and the country. You don't care about people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Nazis, human extinction. These people are buffoons, they wouldn't know science if it got in the shower with them. No human atrocity is too ludicrous to draw a comparison with. It's total hysteria. It's hilarious actually.</p><p>For some reason, though, every candidate was willing to fly to Miami on a gas guzzling airplane for the debate, emitting carbon along the way. That's weird.</p><p>So in other words, the world is ending, but it's not important enough to curtail their ambition.</p><p>Justin Haskins is a research fellow at the Heartland Institute and he joins us tonight. Justin, does this confuse you if this is an existential threat -- I love that phrase, not that I know what it means -- but to humanity, if it's worse than the Nazis, why would you fly on an airplane ever if you really believe that?</p><p>JUSTIN HASKINS, RESEARCH FELLOW, HEARTLAND INSTITUE: Yes, I mean, I have a better question, why would you ever support a bunch of socialist policies? Why would you want to spend even one single penny on anything other than stopping this supposed existential threat that's going to wipe out humanity in 80 years?</p><p>If we're all headed for a Mad Max, post-apocalyptic, hell scape universe in 80 years, shouldn't we be focusing all of our money and energy on stopping that problem, and yet they want free college tuition for everyone, canceling all student loan debt, Federal jobs guarantee, universal healthcare, basically any socialist program they can think of? That's what they're calling for.</p><p>But I don't -- I'm not confused by this. It's obvious why they're doing this. They're doing this because this is all about socialism. This is not about climate change. This is not about saving the planet. This is about socialism, and any Democratic Party presidential candidate who wants to debate us on the climate science, we are more than willing to do that.</p><p>We have a conference coming up at the Heartland Institute, July 25th, in Washington, D.C., any presidential candidate who wants to come and debate us on climate science, we will gladly host you. I don't think anyone is going though.</p><p>CARLSON: I don't think they are going to take you up on that. So you follow this for a living. China is the greatest emitter of carbon, of course in the world by far, it's the biggest polluter, too in conventional terms. Do you ever hear Democratic candidates denounce China?</p><p>HASKINS: No, never. And the amazing thing about that is, is that even if we were to reduce our CO2 emissions down to zero -- down to zero -- it wouldn't do anything because China and India and countries like that are spending or are emitting way more fossil fuels or carbon dioxide emissions than we are here in the United States. It is not going to make any difference over the next 10 years.</p><p>The reality is that CO2 emissions, global CO2 emissions are going to increase no matter what we do here in America. So Democrats who tell you otherwise are lying to you. They're lying to you because this again, is not about climate change. It's not about saving the planet. It's about socialism. Plain and simple.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, about increasing their power over you. Justin, good to see you tonight. Thank you.</p><p>HASKINS: Thanks.</p><p>CARLSON: Voters in Queens, New York last night elected a new District Attorney. Her name is Tiffany Caban. She was endorsed by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and funded by billionaire leftists including George Soros. She just won the Democratic primary there, so in effect, she is the office holder because that's the same as winning the November election.</p><p>Once she is officially in office, Caban is clear about what she wants to do. She's going to decriminalize prostitution, decriminalize drug offenses and fare evasion in the New York City subway, she will end cash bail for all criminal offenses, and she will close down New York's famous Rikers Island Prison without building a replacement for it.</p><p>What would that mean for New York? Howie Carr is a radio host. He has been watching this carefully and he join us tonight. Howie, what would happen if you did what she says she is going to do?</p><p>HOWIE CARR, RADIO HOST: Well, it's chaos, obviously. I mean, Queens is a very big place. It's got more population than 15 states. Archie Bunker and Edith Bunker obviously don't live there anymore.</p><p>She was elected with a tiny vote. It was only 11 percent turnout in a special election. The regular Queens Democrat machines split the vote two or three different ways and she slid in by a thousand votes. But this is just total chaos what's going on here, Tucker.</p><p>You know, she wants to decriminalize turnstile jumping on the subways and the buses. And yet, you know, across the river in Manhattan, Governor Cuomo who backed the losing candidate, he just talked about adding 500 cops to the subways and buses in Manhattan to stop the crime and the fare jumping that's been created by this same policy in the borough of Manhattan.</p><p>And you know, Soros has taken over -- these are, you know, kind of low profile but very powerful prosecutorial jobs here. He knocked off two moderate Democrats in your neck of the woods in Northern Virginia a couple of weeks ago.</p><p>They've elected these people in Philadelphia, St. Louis, the Jussie Smollett disaster is pretty much due to this new State's Attorney in Cook County, Chicago. She is another, you know, one of these woke prosecutors. And it's just -- it's crazy.</p><p>And you know, this woman -- Caban -- ran on a platform of --</p><p>CARLSON: Wait, but I am confused here.</p><p>CARR: You know, we've got the end mass incarceration. There is no mass incarceration. The jail population in New York is down 50 percent in the last 20 years. The prison population of the state is down 31 percent.</p><p>You know, what are they talking about? And you know, people don't know what a crime is anymore. Boston is this the same way.</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever happened to campaign finance reform? So you have one guy, some naturalized American, George Soros, who hates the United States and wants to destroy it, and he gets to choose who enforces the law in all these different cities, because he's rich, and the rest of us aren't as rich? Whatever -- the left used to be upset about things like that, but now they're there for it. They think George Soros ought to be allowed to control the country in the way he does. What changed?</p><p>CARR: Yes, I don't know. Well, you know, I tell you, I don't think these -- what used to be called the mainstream Democrats are paying much attention here.</p><p>You know, Cuomo, the Governor was complaining today about the miserable turnout and the -- you know, the normal Democrats splitting a vote. It happened in Boston, too, Tucker. Last year, Rachel Rollins was elected.</p><p>And these candidates keep going further and further left that the DA in Boston, just want a court case to keep I.C.E. agents out of the court rooms. Now this Caban in Queens is talking about actually arresting I.C.E. agents in courthouses, and there's all this confusion, too.</p><p>CARLSON: You know exactly where this is going. You go ahead.</p><p>CARR: We had a guy last month, he just got out of jail. And he said he went out to a grocery store and started shoplifting because the cops picked him up, and this was in the suburbs and he said, \"You can't arrest me. Shoplifting is no longer illegal in Boston.\" And the cop said, \"Well, that's true in Boston, but you're not in Boston. You're in Norfolk County.\"</p><p>So you know there's all kinds of confusion even for the criminal community they want to help.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, the criminal community. The whole thing is -- we know where this is going. Howie Carr, great to see you. Thanks.</p><p>CARR: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, here's a happy story, one of the most amazing survival stories really ever, a man dragged away by a bear found alive a month later in the bears cave waiting to be eaten, but rescued. We'll tell you exactly what happened after the break.</p><p>Plus, the press routinely denounces the President is a threat to the Free Press. But should they be worrying more about the influence of Facebook and Google? The two companies that have actually destroyed the American media. We will tell you, after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back from ZKyoto. One of the reasons journalists are so hysterical recently is that journalism itself is dying in this country. In the past 30 years -- 28 years more precisely -- newspapers have cut more jobs in this country -- in America -- than coal, steel or commercial fishing. It's being hollowed out. The only people left are the dumb ones.</p><p>Digital journalism was supposed to be the future, it was supposed to rescue the whole operation. But earlier this year, there were mass layoffs at digital journalist outposts, \"Huff Po,\" BuzzFeed and other new media giants.</p><p>We recently talked with Matt Stoller of the Open Markets Institute about why this is happening. He says that Facebook and Google are the cause, they are the enemies of a healthy democratic Free Press. Here's part of our conversation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So, state as clearly as you can, we often hear journalism is dying, and now online journalism dying as well. But rarely do people say exactly why. Why?</p><p>MATT STOLLER, FELLOW, OPEN MARKETS INSTITUTE: Well, it's because Google and Facebook have monopolized the advertising market. It's not so much technology, as it is the business models of these two communication networks.</p><p>CARLSON: So that means that once they have this duopoly and they control virtually all online advertising, they take all the money and starve the sites that are driving the traffic. Is that what you're saying?</p><p>STOLLER: Yes, so just to kind of explain. Google and Facebook are both -- they are essentially communication networks that you have to use. They are monopolies. Google is search and a bunch of other products. Facebook is social networking. And effectively every business or publisher and person on the internet has to use them.</p><p>And what they do with their power is they surveil you, they learn all your secrets and then they run large advertising businesses and manipulate users. You, other businesses, and the flow of information across the web to serve themselves and this diverts advertising money that used to go to publishers into the pockets of Google and Facebook.</p><p>So that, you know, these people know why all the journalists are being laid off. It's because that money that used to go -- and by the way, this is a post 2009 phenomenon. So it isn't the internet. It's a specific business model that has emerged on the internet after 2009.</p><p>CARLSON: I'm thinking as I'm listening to you, boy, we should have a law against that. But I guess it turns out, we already do have a number. We've had them for over a hundred years, and they ban monopolies for the very reasons that you're describing. But no one in the Congress or anywhere else seems willing to invoke these laws. Why is that?</p><p>STOLLER: Well, since the 1970s, we've had kind of been enthralled to this philosophy that says the only way to determine if something is a monopoly is if consumer pricing -- is if you can see changes in consumer pricing.</p><p>But because Google and Facebook appear to be free, you don't pay any cash for using their services, enforcers and antitrust regulators tend to say, \"Oh, well, there's no market power problem there.\" It's an absurd philosophy. It's crazy. It's not really in the law. It's in a bunch of made up court decisions.</p><p>But that's the way that we do antitrust enforcement now and it's time to start rethinking these choices so that we can have a Free Press.</p><p>CARLSON: Right. And so the alternative, what we have now is a system where our biggest newspaper in the capital city is the private broadsheet of the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos, who is responsible in part for the destruction of the media.</p><p>So the media can exist independently, and now Jeff Bezos has the biggest megaphone in the city of Washington. That doesn't seem like a dystopian outcome?</p><p>STOLLER: Of course, it is. I mean, the Free Press should not be the play thing of, you know, rich monopolists. But it is and that is a devastating situation that we're in right now.</p><p>And the solution is pretty simple. If you are a communication network that people have to use, so if you are a monopoly that people have to use to get information from them, to you know, their friends or family or other businesses, you should not also be able to run an advertising business. It's very simple. Break them up.</p><p>We've done it many times before in our history. We can do it again. It's a simple fix.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: A man has been found alive a month after he was dragged away by a brown bear, a remarkable story just ahead as we continue our live broadcast from the beautiful Suiran Hotel along the Hozu River here in Kyoto, Japan.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back. We've got live pictures I think of the President landing in Anchorage, Alaska. There it is. Presidential plane, Air Force One refueling in Anchorage en route to Osaka, Japan, we will see him in a couple of days for the G20. What a pretty plane.</p><p>Well, you might assume based on his name that \"Teen Vogue\" is some kind of fashion website, but in our modern cartoon world, of course it's not, it's much more than that.</p><p>Yesterday, \"Teen Vogue\" tweeted this to its followers, quote, \"Everything you should know about Karl Marx, and how they're relevant to our current political climate.\" \"Teen Vogue\" didn't mention the downside to millions, many millions, tens of millions murdered by Marx's ideas, the ruin of Venezuela, Russia, Cuba, and so many other countries. Instead they call Marxism inspiration and a bulwark against oppression.</p><p>\"Teen Vogue\" used to target actual young people, now they target 35-year- olds with childish political beliefs. Also poisonous.</p><p>Well, one of Japan's closest neighbors is Russia and that's where this incredible survival story comes from. A Russian man in Siberia was mauled by a brown bear then dragged back to its den to be kept for later like a plate of leftovers.</p><p>He was suffering from a broken spine and yet he managed to stay alive for a month, apparently without food or water until he was found by a group of hunters who rescued him. He is now in a hospital recovering. How did this happen? Is it a real story? Could you do it if you were grabbed by a bear?</p><p>Dr. Marc Siegel is Fox's medical correspondent who joins us tonight. Doctor, does this --</p><p>MARC SIEGEL, FOX NEWS MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It's one of the stories that you want to believe is true. As a matter of human physiology, is it possible? Could this be true?</p><p>SIEGEL: You know it's possible under the current -- under the following circumstances. First of all, brown bears do not usually drag humans anywhere. Humans are not their prey.</p><p>But if he attacked the cubs or he put the cubs at risk, the bear might get angry, and those brown bears do sometimes store food and they wait for a while until their food decomposes, and then they eat it. So it's possible he would be in this cave for a month.</p><p>He can survive without food, Tucker. You can survive weeks and weeks without food. Mahatma Gandhi survived on a fast for 21 days without food. You need water though. And you're not going to survive by drinking urine the way he says he did. That's the part of the story I don't believe because urine is very salty, it's going to make you more dehydrated.</p><p>You could survive with the broken bones, you might look like that because areas of your of your skin are going to slough off from insufficient blood flow. The body will protect its vital organs and blood and glucose and oxygen goes to the vital organs.</p><p>But here's how you could survive. If you were drinking from the rock icicles in the cave. If the water that was dripping down in a cave, it has minerals in it and if you're drinking that, you could survive and it's cold there.</p><p>Now Tuva, which is near Mongolia is about 27 to 28 degrees. The colder it is, the more likely you might survive because your organs stay alive longer including your brain. I think it's possible. I think it's plausible but not the urine part of this. You'd have to get water somehow. If he got water he could survive.</p><p>CARLSON: That's heartening because the urine part is of course repulsive, as well. Dr. Siegel great to see you tonight.</p><p>SIEGEL: The courage is amazing, too, if it happened. Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: It is amazing. It is amazing. Nothing like a Siberian hunter. Tough group. Healthcare costs across the world, particularly in this country are crushing. Ours are some of the highest in the world here in America. And they're rising all the time. Where's the money going?</p><p>Well, one place is the massive paychecks for the heads of supposedly charitable hospitals. Openthebooks.com just released a report on the top executives of 82 large charity hospitals. At 74 of them, the top paid executive makes at least a million dollars a year. Check this out.</p><p>At six -- six of these hospitals -- charity hospitals, the head guy, the administrator makes more than $10 million a year, which is hard to believe.</p><p>Adam Andrzejewski is the founder of Open the Books and he joins us tonight. Adam, more than $10 million a year for running a Charity Hospital. How does that work?</p><p>ADAM ANDRZEJEWSKI, FOUNDER, OPEN THE BOOKS: Well, it's outrageous. The top guy last year at Banner Health based in Phoenix, Arizona made $21.6 million. The second highest paid executive at Banner made $12.4 million. That means two executives at Banner last year cleaned off $34 million.</p><p>CARLSON: Wait. Can I stop you there? Do you have any idea what percentage of the billing to that hospital comes from Federal or state government? Probably the majority, right?</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: Well, it's a lot of money. Out of the 82 charitable hospitals, $2 billion worth of research grants flowed from the Federal agencies and we estimate that the 82 charitable hospitals did $83 billion last year in Medicaid and Medicare billings. So it's a substantial amount of money, probably about one third of their revenues comes directly from government.</p><p>CARLSON: And they're rewarding themselves over $10 million a year. I mean, that's -- am I missing something or is that like disgusting?</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: No, no, you got it and we found charities, operating hospitals all over the country participating in this. So in Chicago, Northwestern Memorial, their CEO made $11 million. Ascension Healthcare in St. Louis, Missouri last year, their chief made $13 million.</p><p>We looked at the last four years of his compensation and we were able to quantify that he pulled out $60 million of cash compensation.</p><p>CARLSON: I want to put his picture, I wish we had his picture for the screen because that's really -- it's a charity hospital.</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: In Houston, Texas --</p><p>CARLSON: It's unbelievable, and by the way --</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: They justified --</p><p>CARLSON: Keep going.</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: They justified an $18 million payout because the CEO was in his last year. It was a golden parachute retirement payment.</p><p>Look, this is patient money. The average family in America is paying nearly $20,000.00 in healthcare costs. Congress needs to crack down and there's a lot that Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary can do to start enforcing rules on these charities.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, these are all Hillary donors, anyway, by the way, trust me. Adam, infuriating, fascinating segment. Thank you for that.</p><p>ANDRZEJEWSKI: Thank you, Tucker. Thanks for your interest in our work.</p><p>CARLSON: Amazed by it. That's it from Japan. Don't forget, we will monitor the Democratic debate so you don't have to. Have a great night doing something wholesome. We will see you tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that's the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. We leave you from Kyoto, truly one of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p><p>We'll be interviewing the president at the end of the week. See you tomorrow</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019062601cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WF5-P4M1-JB20-G0B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7496\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Robert Mueller</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Espionage</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Journalism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big Tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Healthcare</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hospitals</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Can you assure me that the majority will hold itself to the same standard in this case?</p><p>With that, I yield back.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122774117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMJ-4C81-JCBF-S09S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"902\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Elizabeth Warren says.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Massachusetts Democrat is leading the charge for a regulatory crackdown that would rein in the freewheeling nature of the internet. She wants tech giants such as Amazon, Google and Facebook cut down to size the same way Ma Bell was nearly 40 years ago.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Her fellow 2020 Democratic presidential hopefuls, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and New Age guru Marianne Williamson, have their own plans. They say companies such as Facebook have turned themselves into necessities and the government must respond.</p><p> \"We have to recognize it for what it is: It is essentially a utility that has gone unregulated. And as far as I'm concerned, that's got to stop,\" said Sen. Kamala D. Harris, California Democrat and presidential contender.</p><p> Even as the candidates talk of new rules for the information superhighway, they want the government to become the granddaddy of internet service providers by building federally run high-speed internet in rural and other underserved communities.</p><p> It is the tech equivalent of \"Medicare for All\" government-run health care. One candidate, Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Indiana, even dubbed his plan \"Internet for All.\"</p><p> These candidates backed away from a proposed takeover of health care recently after voters balked at potential impacts on services they enjoy, such as the freedom to pick their doctors and insurance plans.</p><p> Voters are not convinced that it's time to mess with their favorite tech companies.</p><p> A majority say it is unnecessary to break up Amazon, Apple and Google to stop them from becoming too big and powerful, according to a survey this summer by RealClear Opinion Research.</p><p> Americans told the pollsters that it is unnecessary to break up Amazon (55% to 30%), Apple (55% to 28%), Google (53% to 32%) or Facebook (48% to 38%).</p><p> The survey showed no significant differences in opinion by party affiliation. Democrats and Republicans were equally as likely to say splitting up Big Tech is unnecessary.</p><p> When Ms. Warren first floated her breakup plan in April, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that 50% of voters opposed it and 47% supported it.</p><p> A larger majority of 68% told the pollsters that those types of decisions should be left to the free market instead of the government.</p><p> Under Ms. Warren's plan, Facebook would be forced to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon would have to jettison Whole Foods grocery stores and Zappos shoe stores from its retail empire, and Google would shed Waze maps, Nest smart home systems and the online advertising platform DoubleClick.</p><p> Ms. Warren insisted that nothing consumers like about the companies would change.</p><p> \"Here's what will change,\" she said. \"Small businesses would have a fair shot to sell their products on Amazon without the fear of Amazon pushing them out of business. Google couldn't smother competitors by demoting their products on Google Search. Facebook would face real pressure from Instagram and WhatsApp to improve the user experience and protect our privacy. Tech entrepreneurs would have a fighting chance to compete against the tech giants.\"</p><p> The companies in the candidates' crosshairs staunchly oppose divvying up their businesses, as do technology enthusiasts.</p><p> \"Breaking up large internet companies just because they are large won't help consumers. It will hurt them by reducing convenience, reducing the quality of service and innovation, and in some cases leading to the introduction of priced services,\" said Rob Atkinson, president of Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a science and technology policy think tank.</p><p>Amazon officials criticized Ms. Warren for accusing the company of stealing business ideas from people using its platform, an allegation she regularly makes from the stump.</p><p> \"Sellers aren't being 'knocked out'  they're seeing record sales every year,\" Amazon tweeted.</p><p> Breakup plans for Big Tech won support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocate for civil liberties on the internet.</p><p> \"It is quite possible that industry is opposing discussions of structural separation policies, which have a long history in antitrust law because they might be the most effective solution,\" the group said in a blog post. \"An extraordinarily valuable benefit of the internet is how it has lowered the barriers to participation in commerce, politics and other social activities that historically were often reserved to the powerful few.\"</p><p> It's not just Democratic candidates who want a piece of Big Tech. Congress is eyeing tougher regulations. The Justice Department and a bipartisan group of state attorneys general are exploring antitrust lawsuits.</p><p> Republican lawmakers such as Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri have proposed tighter regulations for tech giants, though their ideas stop far short of slicing and dicing the businesses.</p><p> Democratic strategist Zach Friend called it a \"low-risk proposition\" to go after tech companies because they do not have a direct constituency like most other sectors.</p><p> \"Even though there are real and valid concerns about privacy that should be addressed, there is also a reality that people's daily lives are intertwined with tech and most appreciate what tech does for them,\" he said. \"From health care improvements to research capabilities to the ability to communicate with family, it seems that people either view it approvingly or at least as a flawed necessity.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-1757E56E9D506118</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WWB-H601-DXVP-V4RJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>23 August 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002O8A</classCode><className>DOUBLECLICK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

David Cicilline told POLITICO Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The so-called Protecting Democracy from Disinformation Act would limit political advertisers to targeting users based only on age, gender and location - a move intended to crack down on a practice known as microtargeting, in which advertisers direct messages at subsets of users based on data ranging from their hobbies to their ethnic background. The tactic has come under fire from Democratic lawmakers, who say it allows politicians, including President Donald Trump, to tailor lies to voters online with impunity - and tech companies to profit off it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cicilline said the legislation, which he plans to introduce Tuesday, is essential toward stopping politicians from targeting voters who may be more susceptible to believing deceitful advertising. </p><p>\"The microtargeting is where the real danger is,\" he said during a phone interview.</p><p>The Rhode Island Democrat said that the practice also serves to shield what politicians say from public scrutiny.</p><p>\"You lose the ability to be able to counter it in the open with a contrary assertion by someone else, because we don't even know that people got those ads that said false things,\" said Cicilline.</p><p>The incoming legislation would also set new disclosure requirements for political ads online, including their cost, how they were targeted and who saw them. And it would give regulators at the Federal Election Commission, tasked with overseeing its enforcement, the power to seek criminal penalties against online platforms that knowingly violate the measure.</p><p>The legislation is expected to be introduced with other Democratic co-sponsors, according to a Cicilline spokesperson, who declined to elaborate.</p><p>The proposal could draw significant support from congressional Democrats, who have hammered Facebook and other social media companies for taking a tougher stance against misinformation on their platforms, particularly in political ads. But it's unlikely to pick up steam among Republicans on Capitol Hill, some of whom have blasted those calls as an affront to free and political speech.</p><p>Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), one of Silicon Valley's fiercest GOP detractors in Washington, offered rare praise for Facebook last year after the company said it was largely standing pat on its advertising policy that allows politicians to narrowly target voters with ads, even if they contain falsehoods.</p><p>\"Mark Zuckerberg is right ... We should be defending free speech, not empowering a handful of Silicon Valley billionaires to control all public discussion,\" Cruz told POLITICO in October.</p><p>Trump's reelection campaign has also pushed back on the movement for restrictions on targeting, saying such tools \"help us reach more great Americans &amp; lift voices the media &amp; big tech choose to ignore!\"</p><p>The microtargeting practice is widely used by candidates of all political stripes, and political ad spending online is booming this election cycle, despite the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The bill notably does not target the online industry's prized liability protection over user-posted content under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Cicilline told reporters in February he was preparing legislation to amend the legal shield to stop tech giants from publishing and profiting off targeted, false political advertising.</p><p>Cicilline said Thursday he opted to keep the legislation more tightly focused.</p><p>\"This is for a very specific kind of speech,\" he said. \"It's very narrowly tailored to elections and to speech in the context of elections and [Section] 230 of course has applications to all speech on the internet, so that's kind of a broader question.\"</p><p>He said he also decided against incorporating limits specifically on falsehoods in political ads, which could prove challenging to litigate. Cicilline previously said the bill would crack down on misinformation in political ads, but did not say how.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats have banded together on separate legislative efforts to weaken Section 230 of the CDA, a 1996 law widely credited with helping the internet industry to flourish by protecting companies from a barrage of lawsuits over harmful material online.</p><p>A bipartisan group of senators, led by Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are pushing separate legislation that could strip companies of their liability protections if they cannot prove they are taking sufficient steps to curb child exploitation on their sites. The bill has faced intense opposition from the tech industry, whose representatives say Section 230 enables them to take action against bad actors abusing their products.</p><p>That provision broadly shields digital services from lawsuits over content posted by users and their good faith efforts to take down noxious material.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1285396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYH-RBJ1-F118-91F2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"820\"/><timeReceived>9:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 21, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It would force tech companies to disclose the personal information they have collected, delete or correct inaccurate or incomplete information and allow consumers to block the sale of their information.</p><p>If passed the act would also make it easier for US authorities to levy large fines on tech companies and make it easier for individuals to bring legal action against the companies that breach the privacy rules. It also includes tougher rules to protect teenagers and children.</p><p>The bill's sponsors are all Democrats and include presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar. \"Companies continue to profit off of the personal data they collect from Americans, but they leave consumers completely in the dark about how their personal information is being used,\" she said. \"It's time for Congress to pass comprehensive privacy legislation.\"</p><p>Bipartisan support for tighter regulation of the tech companies has grown after scandals including Cambridge Analytica, the political consultancy that harvested the personal data of millions of people's Facebook profiles without consent. However, the bill will face stiff opposition, not least from the tech industry's powerful lobbying arm which has successfully fought off other attempts to pass more meaningful regulation.</p><p>Evan Greer, deputy director of digital rights group Fight for the Future, said Copra looked like a legitimate effort to put at least basic protections in place.</p><p>\"The writing is on the wall: companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have achieved their titanic size and by harvesting our personal data as part of a business model based in surveillance that is fundamentally at odds with basic human rights,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's a no-brainer for lawmakers to support this basic level of protection. In the end, strong data privacy legislation will need to be one piece of a larger effort to rein in big tech and ensure that the internet is a force for liberation and creativity, rather than tyranny and greed,\" said Greer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-58171642</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKM-Y681-F021-603C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><timeReceived>4:38 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech's biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Senators Elizabeth Warren </nameText></person>of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders of Vermont, </nameText></person>an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren't paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and <person><nameText>Amy Klobuchar </nameText></person>of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can't be trusted to regulate themselves.</p><p><person><nameText>Representative </nameText></person>David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, ''We need to restore competition and protect our rights online.'' He added: ''The promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward.''</p><p>  The concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>  Over the past year, Googlehas avoided the intense scrutiny heaped upon internet rivals, even as it grappled with questions about privacy and misinformation on services like YouTube. But the company upset lawmakers when it decided not to send a top executive to testify alongside leaders of Facebook and Twitter at a hearing a few months ago. Lawmakers left an empty seat for Googlewith a name tag for Larry Page, chief executive of <person><nameText>Alphabet, </nameText></person>Google's parent company.</p><p>  To tamp down criticism, Mr. Pichai traveled to Washington in September, meeting with lawmakers from both parties. He agreed at the time to testify later in the year.</p><p>  The hearing, ''Transparency &amp; Accountability: Examining Googleand Its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices,'' is expected to cover a wide array of topics, led by Republican allegations of anti-conservative biases in how search results are surfaced. A Google spokesman declined to comment about the hearing.</p><p>  Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.</p><p>  ''Recent reports suggest Googlemight not be wielding its vast power impartially,'' said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. ''Its business practices may have been affected by political bias.''</p><p>  Some Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data.</p><p>  ''The public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,'' said <person><nameText>Representative </nameText></person>Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ''Unfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias.''</p><p>  The prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch.</p><p>  ''The internet companies' blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,'' said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen &amp; Company. ''Democrats now see political gain in taking on tech.''</p><p>  On Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle's co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm's chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.</p><p>  While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks.</p><p>  At the hearing, Mr. Pichai is likely to get questions about Google's search results, which company executives have repeatedly denied are altered for political purposes. He will probably also get questions about privacy and how the company handles cases of sexual harassment.</p><p>  Last month, more than 20,000 employees around the world walked out in protest of the company's handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The company gave in to one of the protest organizers' demands to end the practice of forced arbitration for employees bringing sexual harassment claims.</p><p>  Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google's possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking.</p><p>Googlehas more recently been working on a search engine that adheres to the Chinese government's censorship requirements. The project, code-named Dragonfly, has upset employees who feel Googlewould be playing a part in silencing dissidents and spreading government propaganda. Mr. Pichai has said that Googleis merely investigating the idea and that it has not made a decision to move forward with a search product for China.</p><p>  Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google's chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington.</p><p>  Mr. Pichai's political donations also mirror Google's attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations. In 2017, he donated nearly $34,000 to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: <person><nameText>Sundar Pichai, </nameText></person>Google's chief executive, will testify on Tuesday before the House Judiciary Committee.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the Justice Department's antitrust chief at a Senate hearing Tuesday. \"You're doing this because the administration is cross.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official, Makan Delrahim, defended the investigation and denied any political motivation or influence from the White House.</p><p>Delrahim said the investigation seeks to determine whether antitrust laws were violated by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW in reaching the July deal with California.</p><p>Under the deal being reviewed, the automakers plan to comply with pollution and related mileage requirements established by California that are tougher than the federal standards sought by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Democrats also questioned whether political influence played a role in the antitrust regulators' effort to block the $85 billion merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner or their approval of T-Mobile's $26 billion takeover of rival cellphone company Sprint.</p><p>The administration, meanwhile, is poised to revoke California's authority to set auto mileage standards, insisting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A formal announcement is expected Wednesday.</p><p>Asked whether Trump or anyone at the White House had pressured him on antitrust actions, Delrahim said no, \"unequivocally.\"</p><p>\"I don't view politics as having a role in our enforcement decisions,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting separate, far-reaching antitrust investigations of the big tech companies. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel didn't raise political interference as an issue in those reviews, but they joined with Republicans to criticize federal regulators' enforcement actions against Big Tech as too weak.</p><p>\"What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He told FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, who testified at the hearing alongside Delrahim: \"We need more than a task force. We need action.\"</p><p>Simons confirmed that the FTC's competition task force is investigating Facebook. Delrahim acknowledged that Google is among the companies included in the Justice Department's probe. In addition, Amazon and Apple are believed to be under investigation by both agencies.</p><p>The FTC's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy violations, for example, came under sharp criticism by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as too lenient. \"What I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis,\" he told Simons.</p><p>Simons maintained that if the agency had fought Facebook in court, the case would have dragged on for years and the government would have wound up with an even smaller penalty.</p><p>Hawley expressed concern that \"turf wars\" over antitrust between the FTC and the Justice Department have led to a lack of enforcement. And Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the Republican heading the subcommittee, condemned the dual investigations of the same companies as inefficient overlap, with regulators grabbing \"the same slice of the same pie at the same time.\"</p><p>\"Consumers are harmed when you're tripping over each other and you're prevented from doing your job effectively,\" Lee said.</p><p>But Sen.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the Justice Department's antitrust chief at a Senate hearing Tuesday. \"You're doing this because the administration is cross.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official, Makan Delrahim, defended the investigation and denied any political motivation or influence from the White House.</p><p>Delrahim said the investigation seeks to determine whether antitrust laws were violated by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW in reaching the July deal with California.</p><p>Under the deal being reviewed, the automakers plan to comply with pollution and related mileage requirements established by California that are tougher than the federal standards sought by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Democrats also questioned whether political influence played a role in the antitrust regulators' effort to block the $85 billion merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner or their approval of T-Mobile's $26 billion takeover of rival cellphone company Sprint.</p><p>The administration, meanwhile, is poised to revoke California's authority to set auto mileage standards, insisting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A formal announcement is expected Wednesday.</p><p>Asked whether Trump or anyone at the White House had pressured him on antitrust actions, Delrahim said no, \"unequivocally.\"</p><p>\"I don't view politics as having a role in our enforcement decisions,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting separate, far-reaching antitrust investigations of the big tech companies. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel didn't raise political interference as an issue in those reviews, but they joined with Republicans to criticize federal regulators' enforcement actions against Big Tech as too weak.</p><p>\"What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He told FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, who testified at the hearing alongside Delrahim: \"We need more than a task force. We need action.\"</p><p>Simons confirmed that the FTC's competition task force is investigating Facebook. Delrahim acknowledged that Google is among the companies included in the Justice Department's probe. In addition, Amazon and Apple are believed to be under investigation by both agencies.</p><p>The FTC's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy violations, for example, came under sharp criticism by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as too lenient. \"What I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis,\" he told Simons.</p><p>Simons maintained that if the agency had fought Facebook in court, the case would have dragged on for years and the government would have wound up with an even smaller penalty.</p><p>Hawley expressed concern that \"turf wars\" over antitrust between the FTC and the Justice Department have led to a lack of enforcement. And Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the Republican heading the subcommittee, condemned the dual investigations of the same companies as inefficient overlap, with regulators grabbing \"the same slice of the same pie at the same time.\"</p><p>\"Consumers are harmed when you're tripping over each other and you're prevented from doing your job effectively,\" Lee said.</p><p>But Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the panel's senior Democrat and a presidential candidate, said: \"I am more concerned that consumers are going to get a big pie in their face if we don't do something about this. ... The American people increasingly understand that competition is important for their well-being.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the Justice Department's antitrust chief at a Senate hearing Tuesday. \"You're doing this because the administration is cross.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official, Makan Delrahim, defended the investigation and denied any political motivation or influence from the White House.</p><p>Delrahim said the investigation seeks to determine whether antitrust laws were violated by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW in reaching the July deal with California.</p><p>Under the deal being reviewed, the automakers plan to comply with pollution and related mileage requirements established by California that are tougher than the federal standards sought by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Democrats also questioned whether political influence played a role in the antitrust regulators' effort to block the $85 billion merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner or their approval of T-Mobile's $26 billion takeover of rival cellphone company Sprint.</p><p>The administration, meanwhile, is poised to revoke California's authority to set auto mileage standards, insisting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A formal announcement is expected Wednesday.</p><p>Asked whether Trump or anyone at the White House had pressured him on antitrust actions, Delrahim said no, \"unequivocally.\"</p><p>\"I don't view politics as having a role in our enforcement decisions,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting separate, far-reaching antitrust investigations of the big tech companies. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel didn't raise political interference as an issue in those reviews, but they joined with Republicans to criticize federal regulators' enforcement actions against Big Tech as too weak.</p><p>\"What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He told FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, who testified at the hearing alongside Delrahim: \"We need more than a task force. We need action.\"</p><p>Simons confirmed that the FTC's competition task force is investigating Facebook. Delrahim acknowledged that Google is among the companies included in the Justice Department's probe. In addition, Amazon and Apple are believed to be under investigation by both agencies.</p><p>The FTC's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy violations, for example, came under sharp criticism by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as too lenient. \"What I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis,\" he told Simons.</p><p>Simons maintained that if the agency had fought Facebook in court, the case would have dragged on for years and the government would have wound up with an even smaller penalty.</p><p>Hawley expressed concern that \"turf wars\" over antitrust between the FTC and the Justice Department have led to a lack of enforcement. And Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the Republican heading the subcommittee, condemned the dual investigations of the same companies as inefficient overlap, with regulators grabbing \"the same slice of the same pie at the same time.\"</p><p>\"Consumers are harmed when you're tripping over each other and you're prevented from doing your job effectively,\" Lee said.</p><p>But Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the panel's senior Democrat and a presidential candidate, said: \"I am more concerned that consumers are going to get a big pie in their face if we don't do something about this. ... The American people increasingly understand that competition is important for their well-being.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the Justice Department's antitrust chief at a Senate hearing Tuesday. \"You're doing this because the administration is cross.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official, Makan Delrahim, defended the investigation and denied any political motivation or influence from the White House.</p><p>Delrahim said the investigation seeks to determine whether antitrust laws were violated by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW in reaching the July deal with California.</p><p>Under the deal being reviewed, the automakers plan to comply with pollution and related mileage requirements established by California that are tougher than the federal standards sought by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Democrats also questioned whether political influence played a role in the antitrust regulators' effort to block the $85 billion merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner or their approval of T-Mobile's $26 billion takeover of rival cellphone company Sprint.</p><p>The administration, meanwhile, is poised to revoke California's authority to set auto mileage standards, insisting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A formal announcement is expected Wednesday.</p><p>Asked whether Trump or anyone at the White House had pressured him on antitrust actions, Delrahim said no, \"unequivocally.\"</p><p>\"I don't view politics as having a role in our enforcement decisions,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting separate, far-reaching antitrust investigations of the big tech companies. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel didn't raise political interference as an issue in those reviews, but they joined with Republicans to criticize federal regulators' enforcement actions against Big Tech as too weak.</p><p>\"What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He told FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, who testified at the hearing alongside Delrahim: \"We need more than a task force. We need action.\"</p><p>Simons confirmed that the FTC's competition task force is investigating Facebook. Delrahim acknowledged that Google is among the companies included in the Justice Department's probe. In addition, Amazon and Apple are believed to be under investigation by both agencies.</p><p>The FTC's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy violations, for example, came under sharp criticism by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as too lenient. \"What I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis,\" he told Simons.</p><p>Simons maintained that if the agency had fought Facebook in court, the case would have dragged on for years and the government would have wound up with an even smaller penalty.</p><p>Hawley expressed concern that \"turf wars\" over antitrust between the FTC and the Justice Department have led to a lack of enforcement. And Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the Republican heading the subcommittee, condemned the dual investigations of the same companies as inefficient overlap, with regulators grabbing \"the same slice of the same pie at the same time.\"</p><p>\"Consumers are harmed when you're tripping over each other and you're prevented from doing your job effectively,\" Lee said.</p><p>But Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the panel's senior Democrat and a presidential candidate, said: \"I am more concerned that consumers are going to get a big pie in their face if we don't do something about this. ... The American people increasingly understand that competition is important for their well-being.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island told the Justice Department's antitrust chief at a Senate hearing Tuesday. \"You're doing this because the administration is cross.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The official, Makan Delrahim, defended the investigation and denied any political motivation or influence from the White House.</p><p>Delrahim said the investigation seeks to determine whether antitrust laws were violated by Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW in reaching the July deal with California.</p><p>Under the deal being reviewed, the automakers plan to comply with pollution and related mileage requirements established by California that are tougher than the federal standards sought by President Donald Trump.</p><p>Democrats also questioned whether political influence played a role in the antitrust regulators' effort to block the $85 billion merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner or their approval of T-Mobile's $26 billion takeover of rival cellphone company Sprint.</p><p>The administration, meanwhile, is poised to revoke California's authority to set auto mileage standards, insisting that only the federal government has the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A formal announcement is expected Wednesday.</p><p>Asked whether Trump or anyone at the White House had pressured him on antitrust actions, Delrahim said no, \"unequivocally.\"</p><p>\"I don't view politics as having a role in our enforcement decisions,\" he said.</p><p>The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission are conducting separate, far-reaching antitrust investigations of the big tech companies. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary antitrust panel didn't raise political interference as an issue in those reviews, but they joined with Republicans to criticize federal regulators' enforcement actions against Big Tech as too weak.</p><p>\"What the public sees is a facade with respect to Big Tech,\" said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. He told FTC Chairman Joseph Simons, who testified at the hearing alongside Delrahim: \"We need more than a task force. We need action.\"</p><p>Simons confirmed that the FTC's competition task force is investigating Facebook. Delrahim acknowledged that Google is among the companies included in the Justice Department's probe. In addition, Amazon and Apple are believed to be under investigation by both agencies.</p><p>The FTC's recent $5 billion settlement with Facebook over privacy violations, for example, came under sharp criticism by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., as too lenient. \"What I see from your agency is, frankly, a culture of paralysis,\" he told Simons.</p><p>Simons maintained that if the agency had fought Facebook in court, the case would have dragged on for years and the government would have wound up with an even smaller penalty.</p><p>Hawley expressed concern that \"turf wars\" over antitrust between the FTC and the Justice Department have led to a lack of enforcement. And Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, the Republican heading the subcommittee, condemned the dual investigations of the same companies as inefficient overlap, with regulators grabbing \"the same slice of the same pie at the same time.\"</p><p>\"Consumers are harmed when you're tripping over each other and you're prevented from doing your job effectively,\" Lee said.</p><p>But Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the panel's senior Democrat and a presidential candidate, said: \"I am more concerned that consumers are going to get a big pie in their face if we don't do something about this. ... The American people increasingly understand that competition is important for their well-being.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAPRSS-cbc726513139490585990781704bb4fc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAPRSS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2X-5JW1-DY9S-T0M1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253760</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"624\"/><timeReceived>07:33 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Canadian Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canadian Press</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20815\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 17, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

To the hundreds of you who signed up of the break, thank you and welcome to The Interface. My goal is to offer you the best daily liveblog of a tumultuous era in technology and government, in convenient newsletter format. If the past few weeks were any indication, we ll have plenty to talk about in 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What did you miss over the break? Lots more scrutiny of Facebook, for starters. The New York Times published a fusillade of stories examining the company s historically lax oversight of its data-sharing agreements with third parties; its problematic efforts to aid suicidal users; the political ramifications of its content-moderation regime; and the reluctance of the Federal Trade Commission to weigh in on any of it.</p><p>To some journalists and critics, this coverage offers a necessary corrective to years of blithe utopianism from the tech press. To others both inside and outside Facebook, but reportedly including Mark Zuckerberg   it feels like overkill. To me, the Times story that resonated the most over the break was the investigation into data-sharing practices   I did a bonus newsletter about it, which you can find here.</p><p>What else?</p><p>Facebook s stock price declined so sharply over the past quarter that Zuckerberg stopped selling his shares. Sheryl Sandberg called Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and told him that if he only read some materials that her office would send him, he would change his mind about Facebook being bad for the world. Benioff claimed that the materials never arrived, which seems preposterous.</p><p>A report commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee found that Instagram played a much bigger role in Russia s 2016 information operation than was previously known, and will likely play an even bigger one in 2020. BuzzFeed s analysis of misinformation on Facebook in 2018 found that the top 50 fake posts got only a little less engagement than the top 50 did last year   and more than the top 50 got in 2016.</p><p>Predictions for social networks this year generally leaned negative. The Guardian asked a range of people about what Zuckerberg s big project for the year should be, and their opinions ranged from  he should probably resign  to  he should definitely resign.  Behold the magnificent self-regard of Anti-Social Media author Siva Vaidhyanathan, who wrote:</p><p>Zuckerberg could take a two-year sabbatical from Facebook, enroll at the University of Virginia, and finish his bachelor s degree under my direction. That would serve him   and his company and all its users   better than just about anything else he could do.</p><p>As a serious proposal I find Vaidhyanathan s idea laughable   but I do think it has legs as a sitcom premise.</p><p>Instagram tested a horizontal feed, causing momentary panic. Amnesty International   or was it Supremely Obvious Magazine   announced that women face serious abuse on Twitter. On YouTube, stars promoted a dubious form of gambling, which was the worst thing they did until a few days later, when they put on blindfolds for the spectacularly ill-conceived Bird Box Challenge.</p><p>For more links that caught my eye over the break, keep reading. First, though, I want to talk about Reid Hoffman.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Project Birmingham</emphasis></h><p>There are two basic ways of thinking about Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. One is that the misinformation campaign was a historical anomaly enabled by social networks  naivete, which will be prevented from recurring through a combination of additional tech security personnel, artificial intelligence, and government intervention. The other is that the 2016 revealed vulnerabilities in social platforms so fundamental that they cannot effectively be contained   leaving an opening for any interested parties who wish to sway politics.</p><p>In Project Birmingham, we have compelling evidence for the latter view. A coalition of groups working to support Democrats and progressive causes has been caught employing Russian-style information operations on Facebook. Funded in part by LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman, the operations have now been found to have taken place in Alabama, Texas, and Tennessee. And while no one involved seems to think the operations proved decisive in the 2018 midterm elections, they contribute to a general diminishment of trust in social networks as a platform for honest political discussions.</p><p>Scott Shane and Alan Blinder described the first set of operations, which were discovered in Alabama, on December 19th:</p><p>The project s operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention.</p><p> We orchestrated an elaborate  false flag  operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,  the report says.</p><p>Who s behind all this? Everyone involved has attempted to distance themselves from the work. The Washington Post has done a heroic job attempting to sort through the various donors, nonprofits, researchers, and cybersecurity firms that are involved. Hoffman said he had no knowledge that the groups he funded were going to use Russian-style tactics, and apologized for his negligence. The firm that most people involved say was responsible for the campaign   the cybersecurity firm New Knowledge   swears it was not.</p><p>In any case, somebody s lying. (Facebook has suspended five user accounts so far, including that of New Knowledge CEO Jonathon Morgan.)</p><p>But to underline just one of the points from that Times piece: one strategy here was to have thousands of apparent Russian bots follow Republican candidate Roy Moore, generating media coverage suggesting that Moore was the favored candidate of the Russians   and that Russia might be working to promote his candidacy.</p><p>It s a head-spinning bit of information warfare   a legitimate false-flag operation. And it was only the start. Organizers also worked to promote a write-in candidacy for another Republican candidate in hopes it would siphon votes away from Moore.</p><p>And in a separate effort, they created a fake campaign for a  Dry Alabama  attempting to link Moore to the return of Prohibition. In a follow-up piece today, Shane and Blinder talked to one of the latter campaign s organizers:</p><p>Matt Osborne, a veteran progressive activist who worked on the project, said he hoped that such deceptive tactics would someday be banned from American politics. But in the meantime, he said, he believes that Republicans are using such trickery and that Democrats cannot unilaterally give it up.</p><p> If you don t do it, you re fighting with one hand tied behind your back,  said Mr. Osborne, a writer and consultant who lives outside Florence, Ala.  You have a moral imperative to do this   to do whatever it takes. </p><p>Elsewhere, campaigns in Texas and Tennessee worked to undermine Republicans and promote Democrats using misleading pages that attempted to grow audiences around nonpartisan subjects and then flooded them with political content. Here s Tony Romm, Elizabeth Dwoskin, and Craig Timberg:</p><p>Some of News for Democracy s pages inserted Democratic messages into the feeds of right-leaning voters, according to a review of Facebook s ad archive. News for Democracy ran ads touting Texas Democrat Beto O Rourke on  The Holy Tribune, a Facebook page targeted to evangelicals, the archive shows. Another page called  Sounds like Tennessee  focused on local sports and news, but also ran at least one ad attacking since-elected GOP Sen. Marsha Blackburn.</p><p> People start to trust the content emanating from the page, because it appeals to their interests, and once there is a certain degree of trust, you can start to pivot by slowly adding in kernels of disinformation or overly-politicized information that lacks context,  said Benjamin T. Decker, research fellow at the Shorenstein Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who called such tactics an  intentional act of deception,  that mimicked strategies of Russian operatives around the 2016 presidential election.</p><p>To the extent that any of these efforts had an impact on the 2018 elections, it appears to be small. But it s clear that groups across the political spectrum now believe that these tactics are effective enough to warrant spending significant resources. The tactics are certain to evolve   and the cynicism embodied in Osborne s ends-justify-the-means language suggests this battle will head to some dark new places in 2020.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Democracy</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook, Google to pay Washington $450,000 to settle lawsuits over political-ad transparency</emphasis></p><p>Facebook will no longer accept political ads in Washington due to disclosure requirements that go beyond what the company currently offers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inside the Nasty Battle to Stop Amazon From Winning the Pentagon s Cloud Contract</emphasis></p><p>Naomi Nix reports on shadowy mudslinging involved in winning a large Pentagon contract these days:</p><p>Allegations of a corrupt procurement process have been directed at Pentagon officials and company managers, primarily at Amazon.com Inc., the front-runner for the contract, which involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and Oracle Corp. are the biggest names jockeying against Amazon, though there s no evidence they are behind the mudslinging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In Project Maven s Wake, the Pentagon Seeks AI Tech Talent</emphasis></p><p>Zachary Fryer-Biggs reports on soul-searching at the Pentagon in the wake of Google abandoning Project Maven:</p><p>Inside the Pentagon, Google s withdrawal brought a combination of frustration and distress  even anger   that has percolated ever since, according to five sources familiar with internal discussions on Maven, the military s first big effort to utilize AI in warfare.</p><p> We have stumbled unprepared into a contest over the strategic narrative,  said an internal Pentagon memo circulated to roughly 50 defense officials on June 28. The memo depicted a department caught flat-footed and newly at risk of alienating experts critical to the military s artificial intelligence development plans.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Histories Of Today s Wars Are Being Written On Facebook And YouTube. But What Happens When They Get Taken Down?</emphasis></p><p>Megha Rajagopalan writes about the tension between taking down graphically violent content and preserving evidence of war crimes:</p><p>The way investigators document human rights abuses is undergoing a fundamental shift. Once researchers depended heavily on diaries, physical records, and interviews with witnesses to atrocities that sometimes took place years after the fact. Now, investigators at international bodies like the United Nations and the ICC are also cataloguing and analyzing millions of photos, posts, and videos from social media in an effort to hold human rights abusers accountable in court, working alongside nongovernmental organizations, researchers, and digital detectives. Holding perpetrators of human rights abuses accountable, researchers say, increasingly depends on access to content posted on social media platforms.</p><p>But this shift in how war crimes are being investigated comes at the same time that social media companies are facing unprecedented criticism for failing to police their platforms, allowing neo-Nazis and other extremist groups to spread their messages online.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India Wants Platforms Like Facebook, Google, WhatsApp, And Twitter To Take Down  Unlawful  Content And Break Encryption</emphasis></p><p>In the wake of a similar law being passed in Australia, Pranav Dixit reports on a move to break encryption in India:</p><p>India s government wants to make it mandatory for platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, and Google to remove content it deems  unlawful  within 24 hours of notice, and create  automated tools  to  proactively identify and remove  such material.</p><p>It also wants tech companies to build in a way to trace the source of the content, which would require platforms like WhatsApp to break end-to-end encryption.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vietnam: How Facebook is being abused to silence critics in Germany</emphasis></p><p>Reporters Without Borders reports that the Vietnamese government is successfully getting posts from an activist removed even though he s based in Germany.</p><p> Our research shows that the Vietnamese government is apparently using digital space to suppress critical voices outside the country as well,  said RSF Germany s Executive Director Christian Mihr.  Those responsible must end these attacks and respect press freedom. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twitter in China: Authorities crack down one user at a time</emphasis></p><p>Gerry Shih reports on Chinese censors going door to door telling people to delete their tweets:</p><p>In Beijing and other cities across China, prominent Twitter users confirmed in interviews to The Washington Post that authorities are sharply escalating the Twitter crackdown. It suggests a wave of new and more aggressive tactics by state censors and cyber-watchers trying to control the Internet.</p><p>Twitter is banned in China   as are other non-Chinese sites such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram. But they are accessed by workarounds such as a virtual private network, or VPN, which is software that bypasses state-imposed firewalls.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Censoring China s Internet, for Stability and Profit</emphasis></p><p>Speaking of Chinese censorship, Li Yuan went inside one of the country s censorship factories:</p><p>Mr. Li works for Beyondsoft, a Beijing-based tech services company that, among other businesses, takes on the censorship burden for other companies. He works in its office in the city of Chengdu. In the heart of a high-tech industrial area, the space is bright and new enough that it resembles the offices of well-funded start-ups in tech centers like Beijing and Shenzhen. It recently moved to the space because customers complained that its previous office was too cramped to allow employees to do their best work.</p><p> Missing one beat could cause a serious political mistake,  said Yang Xiao, head of Beyondsoft s internet service business, including content reviewing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LinkedIn Censored A Pro-Democracy Activist s Profile In China But Then Said It Was A Mistake</emphasis></p><p>Megha Rajagopalan reports on an unlikely case in which LinkedIn became a political battleground. Fun 2019 goal: get your LinkedIn page banned, but only in China.</p><p>LinkedIn censored, and then quickly restored, the profile of a New York based Chinese human rights activist on its Chinese platform after a wave of negative publicity.</p><p>Zhou Fengsuo, one of the founders of a nonprofit organization that aids political prisoners and other vulnerable groups in China, is best known as one of the student leaders of the pro-democracy protests at Beijing s Tiananmen Square in 1989, which ended in a bloody crackdown by the Chinese government. He was forced into exile in the United States over his role in the student movement, which landed himon a most-wanted list in China.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How Artificial Intelligence Will Reshape the Global Order</emphasis></p><p>The debate over the effects of artificial intelligence has been dominated by two themes.

The other is the worry that a new industrial revolution will allow machines to disrupt and replace humans in every or almost every area of</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Elsewhere</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook s Lonely Conservative Takes on a Power Position</emphasis></p><p>Deepa Seetharaman profiled Joel Kaplan, perhaps the most influential conservative voice at Facebook:</p><p>This summer, Mr. Kaplan pushed to partner with right-wing news site The Daily Caller s fact-checking division after conservatives accused Facebook of working only with mainstream publishers, people familiar with the discussions said. Conservative critics argued those publications had a built-in liberal bias.</p><p>Mr. Kaplan argued that The Daily Caller was accredited by the Poynter Institute, a St. Petersburg, Fla.-based journalism nonprofit that oversees a network of fact-checkers. Other executives, including some in the Washington, D.C. office, argued that the publication printed misinformation. The contentious discussion involved Mr. Zuckerberg, who appeared to side with Mr. Kaplan, and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. The debate ended in November when The Daily Caller s fact-checking operation lost its accreditation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What Facebook knows about you</emphasis></p><p>Ina Fried made an effort to round up all the different kinds of data that Facebook collects about its users.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook and Consumer Privacy</emphasis></p><p>Here s a newly released market-research survey from Creative Strategies from April 2018, in the midst of the Cambridge Analytica fallout. Among other things, the data suggest that nearly a third of respondents planned to use Facebook less in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Why People Go to Instagram for the Comments Section</emphasis></p><p>Taylor Lorenz reports that it s going down in the Instagram comments section:</p><p>For years, comments on Instagram were secondary to the photo and video posts that make up the app s main feed. But recently, Instagram comment sections have begun to eclipse the photos they sit below.</p><p>Over the past year and a half, the Instagram account @commentsbycelebs has ballooned to nearly 1 million followers by documenting celebrities  most notable Instagram comments. It has spawned a network of copycat comment accounts, many of which have thousands of followers. Part of the rise in comment culture on Instagram is due to product changes made by the platform. In August 2017, Instagram added threaded comments, making it easier for people to have coherent conversations. And in the spring of 2018, the company instituted an algorithm that surfaced noteworthy comments from celebrities, athletes, influencers, and verified accounts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brands  waste  millions as extent of Instagram influencer fraud revealed</emphasis></p><p>Here s a report that says 11 percent of all engagement on sponsored influencer posts in 2017 came from fake accounts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google picks up company behind Q&amp;A app</emphasis></p><p>Google paid  less than $60 million  for a Q&amp;A app I had never heard of, if you wondered whether the going rates for engineers had cooled off at all.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Launches</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook Is Developing a Cryptocurrency for WhatsApp Transfers, Sources Say</emphasis></p><p>Sarah Frier and Julie Verhage had some good new details on Facebook s blockchain division:</p><p>Facebook Inc. is working on making a cryptocurrency that will let users transfer money on its WhatsApp messaging app, focusing first on the remittances market in India, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>The company is developing a stablecoin   a type of digital currency pegged to the U.S. dollar   to minimize volatility, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing internal plans.

By doing so, they contend they are improving their products and benefiting customers. An entrepreneur can create a superior product or service and still get crushed because Big Tech is controlling the game and playing it, too.</p><p>This distorted playing field strikes at the heart of the American Dream.

Its Pegasus software, according to human rights groups and independent investigators, has been used in as many as 45 countries, often by authoritarian leaders to aid the persecution of dissidents, journalists and other innocent civilians.</p><p>What hasn t been previously reported is that NSO is working with a group of Washington-based consultants and law firms to craft its export and ethics policies, including Beacon Global Strategies, a consulting firm run by former top U.S. intelligence and national security officials.

Those headlines, which one psychologist I spoke to described as  scaremongering , are based on studies that show small, ambiguous effects; they suggest that social media is the disease, when the research cannot show that it s anything but a symptom; and almost all the studies are weak and badly designed, so even what little they do show we can t take very seriously.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript</emphasis></h><p>Perhaps the saddest story over the break was the sudden death of HQ Trivia co-founder and CEO Colin Kroll.

Douglas Melamed, professor of law at Stanford told the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights.</p><p>During Tuesday's hearing, four academics confirmed lawmakers' convictions that the tech industry harms consumers, but offered nuanced approaches to improving competition and consumer welfare.</p><p>Melamed, for example, said \"Antitrust institutions are not well suited to assessing other objectives, such as reducing inequality or the wealth or political clout of large businesses or insulating jobs from market forces. Those objectives are best served by other laws.\"</p><p>Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), chairman of the subcommittee, said his \"preferred approach\" is to write better laws rather than use antitrust law against tech companies like Facebook and Google.</p><p>Joshua D. Wright, executive director of the Global Antitrust Institute at George Mason University, agreed, adding that when the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust discretion is too broad, it is \"an invitation to rent-seeking that ends up serving, not the consumers, but the economic interest of one firm or another, and allows the courts to pick winners and losers rather than encourage competition.\"</p><p>Part of the problem is, tech companies like Facebook and Google redefine the meaning of the words \"monopoly,\" \"oligopoly\" and \"consumer welfare.\" Traditionally, antitrust law focuses on the nominal prices of goods and services as a way of determining whether one or more companies rips off consumers (by controlling the market supply and raising prices).</p><p>While consumers do not pay a nominal price to use Facebook or Google, they do pay with their data and their privacy. In exchange for their customers' data, Facebook and Google provide customizable news and information services.</p><p>\"It is a misstatement to say that antitrust is focused on price,\" Melamed said. \"In the Microsoft case for example, price had nothing to do with it. The reason it comes up is because it's easier to measure it. A lot of these so-called free goods are not really free, they're often bundled with other services and temporary. They're sold in a barter exchange, rather than an exchange for nominal cash price.\"</p><p>Facebook and Google control most sources of internet advertising revenue, thus maintaining market dominance and political influence.</p><p>Because they control the information market, some economists consider Facebook and Google to fit the traditional definition of the word \"oligopoly.\"</p><p>\"It was reported not long ago that Google went after the New America Foundation, because the NAF was doing things that Google felt was particularly threatening,\" Robert B. Reich, the chancellor's professor of public policy at Berkeley, told senators at the hearing. \"Google has quietly financed hundreds of professors at universities -- like my own -- that help Google defend itself against regulatory challenges to its market dominance.\"</p><p>This kind of behavior, Reich said, is exactly why regulators should use antitrust law against Big Tech.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) also thinks that is a legitimate use of antitrust law, because by controlling the way people get their information, tech companies like Google effectively destroy the free market.  \"My concern, as a conservative, is the drowning out of individual voices and the ability of these behemoth corporations to extract favors from government and leverage their economic power into political power that results in cronyism and insider dealing and results in a free market that is decidedly not free, but rigged,\" he said.</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-N.Y.) took antitrust considerations a step further.</p><p>\"I think a lot of industries have gotten a free pass, like airlines,\" he said. \"Facebook never should have been allowed to acquire Instagram. I feel like post-merger, some of these should be challengeable, especially when the mergers are approved on conditions that are then violated and have proved anticompetitive.\"</p><p>Melamed said it's possible to challenge a merger years after it completes, but that it's a bit like trying to \"unscramble an egg,\" because now you're dealing with one integrated company, and it can be hard to determine where Instagram ends and Facebook begins.</p><p>Regardless how law enforcement and lawmakers decide to proceed, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) summarized the sentiments of the committee by describing it as a bipartisan issue, recalling how Americans sought to stop anticompetitive behavior since before the nation's founding.</p><p>\"When you look at the history of our country, this started out with the Boston Tea Party -- they were protesting against the monopoly of the East India Trading Company,\" she said. \"They saw it as a way to encourage capitalism, encourage innovation. They didn't see it as a partisan issue. When we look at the facts of increase in concentration, there's many studies showing increase in income inequality. [We] are seeing parallels between the old monopolies of the Gilded Age to the internet monopolies of today.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2019 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.
