Until now, that agenda was in the hands of Frans Timmermans. Jourova was responsible for justice, consumers and gender equality in the previous EC team. Following an EC debate about the union's future budget in April 2018, she reported that all commissioners agreed to introduce a mechanism that would tie EU subsidies to a country's respect to the rule of law,\" TVN 24 said.</p><p>\"I think we should consider creating a stronger dependence between the rule of law and cohesion funds,\" the Polish television reported Jourova's words from a statement dated to November 2017.</p><p>TVN 24 claims Jourova posited that regional and cohesion policy will not be effective without being tied to the rule of law since it will only create corruption and fraud otherwise.</p><p>According to TVN 24, she continued to state that the rule of law is not exclusively a matter of specific countries because they must respect EU law and if one country's justice system is corrupt, it would mean corruption for the whole EU system.</p><p>The Polish television also pointed out that last September, the EC filed a lawsuit against Poland with the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p><p>Even though Poland managed to pass an amendment of its Supreme Court law in order to defuse the EU's criticism, Jourova told Czech media at the time that the EC will continue with the lawsuit.</p><p>The TVN 24 station also summarised the life and political path of Jourova, as well as her inclusion in Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people of 2019 as \"a leading voice in the call for the regulation of digital enterprise and big tech companies.\"</p><p>bas/mr/pvr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CTK-T201909100988301</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CTK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X18-47X1-DYT4-M49T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"381\"/><timeReceived>8:18 PM (Central European Time)</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Czech News Agency (CTK) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CTK National News Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs have declined Facebook's invitation to join Libra[1]. The refusal comes amid worries that cryptocurrency could be used to violate money laundering and sanctions laws. The news was reported by AnnaMaria Andriotis, Peter Rudegair, and Liz Hoffman at The Wall Street Journal. [2]The tech giant planned on launching its Libra cryptocurrency by June 2020. The plans included including over two dozen cofounders and members of the Libra Association. However, these plans have been unraveling since the project was announced early this summer.As of now, Facebook has declined to comment.Lawmakers have had concerns about Facebook moving into the cryptocurrency world, especially after privacy snafus[3] like the Cambridge Analytica[4] scandal.Additionally, when Facebook cryptocurrency chief and former Paypal president David Marcus was questioned about the project[5] by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, he promised that Facebook will not launch Libra until regulators' concerns were addressed.In July, Rep. Maxine Waters and other lawmakers sent a letter[6] to Facebook calling on the company to stop Libra implementation over 'serious concerns' about the project. These criticisms also come amid worries that Facebook and other big tech companies are monopolies without sufficient competition.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is slated to testify before Congress about Libra on October 23.

Many of Libra's backers have already dropped out, including Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[7]. JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs declined Facebook's invitation to join Libra because of worries that cryptocurrency could be used to violate money laundering and sanctions laws, AnnaMaria Andriotis, Peter Rudegair, and Liz Hoffman at The Wall Street Journal reported.[8] Facebook hoped to launch Libra by June 2020 with over two dozen cofounders and members of the Libra Association, but these plans have been unraveling since the project was announced early this summer. Facebook did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment regarding J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs' involvement. </p><p>Lawmakers have had concerns about Facebook moving into the cryptocurrency world, especially after privacy snafus[9] like the Cambridge Analytica[10] scandal. In July, Facebook cryptocurrency chief and former Paypal president David Marcus was questioned about the project[11] by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. He promised that the company wouldn't launch Libra until regulators' concerns were addressed.Read more: Facebook made the unusual decision to push back directly on Elizabeth Warren and her criticism of the company, but its attempt to defend itself backfired spectacularly[12] In July, Rep. Maxine Waters and other lawmakers sent a letter[13] to Facebook calling on the company to stop Libra implementation over \"serious concerns\" about the project. Increased regulatory scrutiny spooked many of the project's backers, and more than a quarter[14] of initial partners have backed out, including PayPal[15], Mastercard, Visa, and eBay.[16] These criticisms also come amid worries that Facebook and other big tech companies are monopolies without sufficient competition. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren[17] has made breaking up large tech companies a cornerstone of her platform. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is slated to testify before Congress \u2014 which will include critics like Waters \u2014 about Libra on October 23.NOW WATCH: Why Apple's Mac Pro 'trash can' was a colossal failure[18]See Also: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will give his 'most comprehensive take' on freedom of speech in a livestream on Thursday[19]Evan Spiegel and Miranda Kerr just welcomed their second child together.

I'm still bullish for 2020 because I'm bullish on the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: BARTIROMO: All right, I just -- I just -- I just want to point out that JPMorgan quarterly average total loans down 1 percent or up 3 percent, excluding the impact of loan sales and home lending.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, again, lending is really a key component here and you are seeing the more -- the portfolio in terms of lending reflect that businesses are still uncertain. There is some uncertainty out there. So we'll keep watching that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: And, Maria, you've been --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Anthony, it's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just wanted to quickly say --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because you've been talking about the importance of asset management for all these financials. Assets under management of 2.4 trillion, was up 19 percent. Up 19 percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So that is an incredibly important number. That's from the JPMorgan press release.</p><p>And, by the way, I pointed out, the stock was down year-to-date. And that's one of the reasons. There was -- you surprise to the upside and you get a lift because people were under-estimating at least to start the new year what JPMorgan would do.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I think one other thing that -- and it's important to the stock, Maria --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a big number.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Is -- and to the bank stocks in general is that for sure, over the last 24 months we've had an easing of regulatory oversight of the banks. I don't mean that the regulators have walked away. But if you talk to any senior banker, they'll tell you that the general tone in Washington is much more positive, more positive about allowing the banks to engage in mergers and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: OH, yes.</p><p>PEEK: And grow their businesses and stuff. I don't think we should forget that because that's an underpinning for this whole sector.</p><p>CHAN: And, Maria, you know that's great for --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, 100 percent. It's a great point.</p><p>Yes, go ahead, real quick, Anthony.</p><p>CHAN: And, Maria, you -- you know that's great for fee income because as the value of these assets, the market went up 30 percent last year. You get that fixed -- that fee income going up as the market goes up. And that was good for JPMorgan . It's been good for a lot of the asset managers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean that -- and that's -- and that's one thing I asked Jamie Dimon about, in terms of Schwab cutting fees to zero, what does that mean for asset management? What about active versus passive? So you'll hear that coming up.</p><p>JPMorgan kicking off this big healthcare conference and the bank earnings with a strong start this morning, posting a beat on both the top and bottom lines for their fourth quarter at JPM.</p><p>I spoke exclusively with JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon late yesterday ahead of the earnings in a wide-ranging interview. We touched on hot button topics ranging from the China trade deal to the ongoing debate between capitalism and socialism.</p><p>We begin with the state of the U.S. economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you.</p><p>So let's start on the economy. You've got such an incredible vantage point. How do you see things today?</p><p>JAMIE DIMON, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, JPMORGAN CHASE: Yes, it's doing OK. You know, the United States consumer, which is 70 percent of the GDP, their confidence levels are very high, their jobs are going up, their wages are going up, their savings are strong, their balance sheet is in excellent shape, more household formation. So I'd say it's very good.</p><p>Thirty percent is the -- is business. And that -- that confidence came down, CapEx came down, and I think a lot of it is driven by trade and trade uncertainty. And that all seems to have stabilized. And, obviously, if we do this trade deal in the next couple days, I think that will be a small plus for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're looking for a good year?</p><p>DIMON: Yes, so far it looks like at least the first part of the year is going to be pretty good. And, obviously, you know, things happen to change that. But I think the economy can continue to hum along.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's such an incredible amount of liquidity out there. The Federal Reserve expanding money supply by more than $400 billion.</p><p>How does that manifest itself? Do you see higher deposit money?</p><p>DIMON: Yes. Well, eventually, it adds to deposits. Some of these activities. And, you know, I think most of that $400 billion the Fed did to -- to ameliorate what's going on in the money markets. So it had a very targeted -- targeted theme. But it does have other effects and stuff like that. So I think the Fed did the right thing to react to that. I think they need a more permanent stabilization as opposed to jump in every time they don't like what's happening at the repo rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, because people were wondering what was going on with the repo market with that overnight need to do something.</p><p>DIMON: Yes. So, remember, that's happened many times before. And the question is, when should the Fed do something about it, not whether it's going to happen.</p><p>In this case, there were a lot of reasons for it, from tax payments to, you know, to certain regulations that caused the year-end numbers to change a little bit. I think they should fix all of that and make it a non-issue, which I personally think is achievable, but it's going to take a little bit of time to -- I think for them to figure out exactly what they want to change.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mentioned to you earlier, I love how much data you have. And you use your card data really effectively to know where to put new branches, where to put new ATMs. Two-thirds of accounts in new markets have been digital.</p><p>Tell me about the branches that you're opening. How much branches did you open last year? What are your expectations this year?</p><p>DIMON: Yes, so we're -- we're thrilled to be expanding again. And we're in -- you know, we're going to D.C. and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and Boston and North and South Carolina and we love opening branches. And, as you say, we do a lot of products and services. And the branch is kind of the hub of that. And clients know us because even though we're not in that state, they have our credit cards. So that credit card relationship is a pretty important thing.</p><p>And the branch is doing quite fine. It's still early. You know, we don't want to talk too much about it, but they're doing far better than we would have thought. And partially because the clients tell us they love the digital services, partially because they love linking various services. But we're going to be opening another 300 in the next couple years and another, you know, total of 16 states, including the ones we did this year.</p><p>So I love expanding. It feels great. We visit those markets.</p><p>The other thing about those markets, I mean you go there, those branches help private banking, middle market, small business, mortgages, and even government business. So -- and even investment banking because it makes you -- it gives you more stature in the state. People know who you are. And so they've been (INAUDIBLE). It's a wonderful thing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We had a guy on the other day, a credit card specialist, and we said, what's the best credit card out there today? He said the Sapphire card.</p><p>DIMON: Sapphire, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just so you know.</p><p>DIMON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I wanted to make sure to tell you that.</p><p>DIMON: Thank you. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>You were taking -- with all of this expanding, you're taking --</p><p>DIMON: I can't take credit for that, by the way. There are a bunch of -- mostly women who actually designed that product years ago. It's just done an outstanding job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's resonating for sure.</p><p>So you're taking market share from a lot of the regional banks as you move into new states. Sun Trust and BBT recently completing the biggest bank merger since the financial crisis, done largely to keep up with you and your spending at JPMorgan .</p><p>Do you expect we're going to see more regional bank mergers in 2020?</p><p>DIMON: I think so. I think there's a lot of business logic for it. And bank mergers, the business logic is there, the industrial logic is there, the economies of scale is there. The difficult part is always what we call the social stuff, name, location, who's going to be the CEO, and those are complex things but if people could overcome that, I think you'll see more mergers for good reason.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What states are you expanding in this year or the next three years at JPM.</p><p>DIMON: Well, I think -- we did South Carolina, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts. We're doing Minnesota. I think Kansas. So it's all over. Sixteen more. We're already in 23. So now it's going to be -- we'll be in a total of almost 40.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you said that the economy is looking good, the consumer is looking good and you've got the data to show us that. But talk to us about the corporate side. We've got this chart that we're going to show and it shows corporate borrowing down in the last year, certainly in the last couple of years.</p><p>What do you think is going on? Is there uncertainty on the corporate side of the economy?</p><p>DIMON: Yes. So the corporate side, confidence was very high, and it came down -- very high. Literally all-time high after tax reform. It came down to -- I call it average. CapEx came down the same way. And a lot of that we think was trade uncertainty. Some geopolitical stuff, but mostly trade uncertainty, which hopefully have a bunch of that behind us now. I don't think it's going to be totally gone, but hopefully a bunch of it is behind.</p><p>But you have to remember, just a very important fact, companies spend capital when they need to spend it. They don't just kind of guess out there. So very often, you know, when there's consumer demand, that's when they start to build a new plan to hire the new workers. And we've had a very slow growing economy for the better part of 10 years. And it sped up a little bit in the last two years. But the fact is, a slow-growing economy will mean that companies need less capital expenditures to keep up with their demand. And so it's hard to figure out exactly what the interplay is, but I do think it's part of the reason.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the auto lending market? This is another issue. There was an article in \"The Journal\" the other day that one guy bought a $27,000 Ford truck. He actually spent $45,000 on the truck.</p><p>DIMON: Yes. Yes, I think it's OK. I mean it's a trillion three. Like the mortgage market's at 10 trillion. Of the trillion three, something like 450 million or billion or so is subprime. And there's always going to be stuff like that. So I think, you know, leases got extended. Collateral has gotten less. I just don't think it's systemic. And my guess is, it's a couple players who are really on the fringes there who will regret having done it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, so you were the first or really --</p><p>DIMON: Actually, on our position, we don't -- if we -- if we're uncomfortable, we simply don't do it. We've told the people in the auto business or any loan business that you can't make good loans, don't make the loans, let the book go down. That's completely fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And in 2007, you saw the crisis coming before a lot of people. In fact, you started, you know, avoiding riskier places.</p><p>Do you see risky areas in the market today that you want to avoid?</p><p>DIMON: Not really. I mean if you look at credit, wholesale, consumer, it's pretty pristine. And so I think you mentioned one where it's out there. I think student lending, which was done by the government, has -- has -- is going to have a huge -- hundreds of billions of dollars of problems. It's not systemic.</p><p>You know, prime -- mortgages have been pretty good. The amount of subprime came down dramatically. It's going up a little bit. And it should. It's making mortgages more affordable to lower income individuals. But at one point those trends will get to a point -- I'm going to be sitting here talking you, now that we've gotten to the point where I think they can cause problems.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>DIMON: But it's not there yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the government sponsored entities, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, continued conversation about these companies going public again. How do you handicap the likelihood of this and how do you anticipate that's going to impact the mortgage business?</p><p>DIMON: Yes. I don't know -- I can't handicap it because you can do it through legislation, though I've been told that some of the things they're talking about doing, they can just do without legislation. If it was with legislation, I think it's virtually impossible.</p><p>But I think what they're talking about is exactly right. You know, it's to get those companies public, recapitalized, to, you know, be very transparent about the guarantee, to have the guarantee paid for by the mortgage underwriters so that you have a very healthy mortgage system with total transparency and those entities should not get involved in political lending. If the government wants to get involved in all forms of other lending, let them do it directly, but not through these public companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about spending in terms of your investing because you've done a lot for Detroit. You've done a lot for Chicago. When you get into a city, you start investing there and you can turn a deprived situation into economic progress.</p><p>What other cities are on your agenda in that regard?</p><p>DIMON: Yes, remember, that's what a bank does, you finance the growth of an economy. And so it could be a country, it could be a city, it could be a company, it could be a small business. And, of course, what we're talking about now is also we do what, you know, more corporate social responsibility stuff. So there's basic banking. But we could help those cities with locating, you know, attracting workers, attracting companies, training workers properly, affordable housing, you know, capital for minority entrepreneurs who may not be able to get it in the normal way. So you can help accelerate the whole city.</p><p>So Detroit was a huge benefit. And we weren't the only ones. A lot of companies who did a lot of work in Detroit. And it works. You would actually take -- a city was -- virtually totally collapsed in terms of unemployment, population and taxation and has turned the corner because of an excellent mayor, et cetera. So we're doing -- those lessons are being replicated by us in New Orleans, LA, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris. And as we've learned, we're going to share that with other person. So this is not about just JPMorgan , it's about what are the things that business can do to help lift up society in a way that's good for everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, I mean, this city, for example, I mean I know you've done this conference for a long time and it's record numbers, everybody comes. Even your competitors, they go, they get hotel rooms elsewhere so that they can talk to your clients.</p><p>But look at the city. The homelessness issue is skyrocketing. There's -- I don't even want to say, poop on the street, et cetera. I mean would you consider moving this conference to another city? Have any of your attendees said to you, look, Jamie, San Francisco's just -- can't do it anymore. Can you move the conference?</p><p>DIMON: Not quite that -- not quite that bad. I understand your point. And bad policy causes all these various issues.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>DIMON: But, you know, what happens in these things, people, they know where they're going, they plan for it the same time of the year, they have their friends and so we have Chase Center here, by the way, so we're doing some functions down there which can accommodate large groups of people.</p><p>But I think the bigger point, cities need policy that actually works to educate the kids, create affordable housing. So, you know, here, a lot of the affordable housing isn't because people won't do it, it's because of zoning laws. And, of course, you have a lot of the big companies don't want to do it. So we do a lot of affordable housing. We're going to get deeply involved in San Francisco across the board. We're a big bank here now and we want to be -- want to be the people that help lift up this city too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, did you see in New York the new bail reform law that they don't -- they can't hold anybody for bail, so they just let out inmates and they let out people who they hope will come back for court.</p><p>DIMON: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There's this one guy that they let out. He keeps going back and robbing Chase banks.</p><p>DIMON: Yes. Oh, really? I -- I -- I did see that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He hands the teller a note. And then -- I mean he's only gotten away with like a couple of thousands of dollars, but he keeps going back to Chase banks --</p><p>DIMON: And he keeps -- and he --</p><p>BARTIROMO: As a New Yorker and as the head of Chase, I mean any -- any remarks?</p><p>DIMON: That's -- you know, I -- I read about that. I think they are going to -- I read that they're going to try to modify it and make it -- there's a reason to do some of it, but maybe it over -- they over -- went overboard.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, looks that way.</p><p>Let's talk technology for a second. You've been investing billions in technology every year, more than 11 billion. Is there an opportunity to acquire a technology company or do you think you're going to keep up that kind of level of spending in technology? Give me the in and out.</p><p>DIMON: Yes, with technology you always want to spend it wisely. But if we're going to build products and services and digital and cloud and AI and reduce fraud and offer you things that you like and get (INAUDIBLE), it's all technology, which (INAUDIBLE) all people. That's what gets that stuff done.</p><p>So we have to do that to compete. And we are very rigorous about doing it. And, yes, we could acquire things. We bought WePay, which is in the merchant processing business. We bought InstaMed, which connects providers and customers for medical payments, which I forgot the number, maybe 80 percent is still done by check. So there are -- there will coming (INAUDIBLE) require which are more technology companies than banking companies that help serve our clients, particularly around -- possibly on payments and data and APIs and things like that. We own a piece of 100 different companies, you know, when we -- particularly when we do business with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got much more of my exclusive interview with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon coming up. Stay with us. We get into China, as well as the world coming up.</p><p>Then, Trump getting his wall built. The president taking additional steps to fulfill a key campaign promise. We've got those details coming up.</p><p>Then this, royal settlement. Queen Elizabeth agreeing to let Prince Harry and Meghan Markle step away from royal duties. Inside the palace split, right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>More money could be on the way to complete the border wall.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details now on the president's plans.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>President Trump planning on diverting $7.2 billion. This is according to \"The Washington Post.\" All of it apparently coming from the Pentagon. The money would finish the project by 2022 and bring the total miles of wall to 885. More than the 509 miles originally planned by the Trump administration. This would bring the total amount of federal funds allocated under the president to $18.4 billion.</p><p>Well, Visa seeing green and Plaid. Visa's buying the Silicon Valley start- up for $5.3 billion. Plaid is the financial technology company that powers Venmo and other banking apps. The deal will help Visa expand its access to fin tech firms as it takes another step to move beyond traditional credit cards. You were just talk about that with Jamie Dimon.</p><p>Well, the Megxit drama still unfolding. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting the queen's consent to live part-time in Canada. This decision coming out of a royal crisis summit concerning the couple's decision to step back from their duties. Harry arrived two hours early, by the way, to meet with her royal highness alone. That's according to \"The Daily Mail.\" Canada has yet to decide whether it's going to pay for security, which could cost upwards of $1 million a year for the couple.</p><p>An American muscle taking home top honors in the motor city. The 2020 Corvette named the North American Car of the Year by a panel of automotive journalists. The model is a complete redesign with the engine moved to the back of the car, which is kind of similar to some other high-end sports cars that we've talked about on the show. The base price for the 2020 Corvette, Maria, $60,000.</p><p>I'll send it back to you and Dagen because for me a car is just something that gets me from point a to point b. You all are way more into this stuff than I am. She's the car girl.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it's not electric, right?</p><p>CASONE: She's the girl.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It looks good.</p><p>What do you think, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are they giving them away. I drive it if it was free. I'm just joking. It's a mid-engine car. So a Porsche 911 is a rear engine car. This is a mid-engine car. I think that they had some difficulty kind of fine- tuning that move -- that placement of the engine. But it looks more like a super car than the previous Corvette.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So they're clearly going after somebody that might buy, I don't know, a more expensive Lambo or even a Ferrari.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Little red Corvette, looking good.</p><p>Coming up, corporate real estate this morning. I'll be speaking with one of the leading investors in lab and technology locations. Wait until you hear what's going on there.</p><p>Then, Astros fired. The front office and Major League Baseball coming down hard on one of last year's World Series contenders. The fallout all ahead.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Alexandria Real Estate Equities is a market leader in labs and technology facilities in America. The company named the number one and most active corporate life sciences investor in Silicon Valley bank's annual ranking. This is the third year in a row they've gotten that distinction.</p><p>Joining me right now is the chairman and founder of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, executive chairman and founder, Joel Marcus.</p><p>Joel, it's great to see you again.</p><p>JOEL MARCUS, FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, ALEXANDRIA REAL ESTATE: A pleasure. Happy New Year, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You too. Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>How's business? Give us an update in terms of what you're seeing with healthcare and technology coming in and renting space in Alexandria.</p><p>MARCUS: Well, we're very fortunate, 2019, the stock had a total performance of 44 percent, which doesn't happen every year. So it was very great. We're seeing the demand for our spaces and really our clusters and our campuses in those clusters to be as white hot as they've ever been.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So the stock is obviously performing so well in reaction to your growth. You are expecting growth in 2020 of what?</p><p>MARCUS: Twenty percent over 2019.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is a huge number, 20 percent.</p><p>MARCUS: It is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So where does that growth come from?</p><p>MARCUS: Well, it comes from a number of locations, really, the demand in Cambridge still remains the strongest in the country. Here we are sitting in San Francisco. That is really also kind of competing for the most demand by our tenants. Many of the companies reporting here and presenting here at JPMorgan .</p><p>I think people want to see these clusters, they want to be in these clusters because they can attract the best talent in both these -- both these locations together with places like Seattle, San Diego. New York City has been very, very strong.</p><p>And I think over the last year or two, we've kind of increased our focus on these campuses within these great brain trust clusters and created what we call the mega cluster, or the mega campus within the cluster.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's --</p><p>MARCUS: A million square feet together. It's -- think of it as almost a new kind of shopping center, but not like the ones we have today where you have a deep concentration of life science and technology tenants surrounded by - - anchored by a transportation hub and surrounded by amenities, places where you want to be, because that's where the collision of science creates these great medicines of the future.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's actually fascinating to see your business and how it has evolved in terms of the tenants.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because that really is an indication of what's going on in America. You've got traditional retail, the malls, if you will, moving out and healthcare moving in.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Technology moving in, right?</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me how that has evolved in the last five years.</p><p>We've been speaking with you on this program for about four or five years here --</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you've walked us through this transition.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes. I think the companies have doubled down on the locations. The hardest thing in corporate America today is the hiring of critical talent for businesses. And we're in the knowledge and information business, the scientific business, and you can only get those quality people in certain locations, in depths, and you must provide great environments, creative environments, you must provide amenities, places where they can hang out close to where they can live and on great transportation hubs. And I think that's what's driven these so-called mega campuses that we've really instituted over the last couple of years and within these great clusters today here in the United States.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So is retail, tradition retail, moving out or I mean it's -- it's -- it's fascinating what you say. The big challenge for companies today is getting the right talent.</p><p>MARCUS: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they're finding that talent in your -- in your neighborhoods.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes. And you find key amenity -- key retail people moving out of some of the malls --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MARCUS: And some of the strip malls and they're coming into places like we have. We just bought a campus in Watertown, right near Cambridge, a million square feet, called the Arsenal on the Cambridge, right on the water.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MARCUS: And people want to be in that location, access to living, you know, living quarters, and retail being very nearby. And so that's kind of the evolution of what you see today.</p><p>So although retail in malls is down, retail within these campuses is really very big demand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about the opioid crisis.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alexandria Real Estate teaming up with Google --</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: (INAUDIBLE) to build a new way and a place to fight the drug epidemic in America.</p><p>MARCUS: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OneFifteen is a technology focused opioid rehab campus in Dayton, Ohio.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about that. It's helping patients, regardless of insurance coverage, right?</p><p>MARCUS: Yes. So it -- right now it's open, taking outpatients. Next summer it will open to be able to treat about 3,000 people. The first one of its kind ever in this country, maybe in the world, where you can not only just go through the detoxification for 28 days, which is the normal standard of care, but you're put out on the street, here you go, to sober living, you go to family reunification, after that job training and then job placement. So it's the whole continuum, the wrap-around services, data driven, very importantly, so you can understand how to treat, because not everybody -- many of the addiction kind of impacts are really caused by deeper problems, depression, schizophrenia, bipolar issues.</p><p>We also think this may be, and we may launch something in San Francisco, this may be a model for homelessness where you bring homeless people into a wonderful environment, you try to help them from -- whether it's mental health or physical health, you try to get them to live independently. You reunify them with their families, you train them and then you put them into the workforce.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>MARCUS: So it might even be extended to something as big a problem here in California, as you know, as homelessness.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's unbelievable.</p><p>MARCUS: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I can't believe the homelessness that has really skyrocketed in places like San Francisco here and in Los Angeles as well. Great idea, Joel. And it's certainly needed.</p><p>Great to have you and congrats on --</p><p>MARCUS: Thank you very much. Thank you. A real pleasure to be here and Happy New Year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And to you. Joel Marcus joining us there. Alexandria Real Estate.</p><p>We will take a quick break but stay with us. We continue our live coverage from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference.</p><p>This week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, tomorrow, big tech bracing for big regulations but stocks continue to soar. We are watching your wallet.</p><p>Thursday, increasing Iranian saber rattling, bringing the U.S. to the brink of war. Senator James Lankford on the path forward.</p><p>And Friday, it is time to Ask Maria, I'm answering the questions that matter to you, that's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Coming to you live this morning from the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference here in San Francisco. It is Tuesday, January 14th. Your top stories right now 07:33 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Bank earnings set to drive the action on Wall Street this morning, JPMorgan reporting better than expected results this morning, the stock is higher on the news, up 1-2/3 percent.</p><p>The company will hold a conference call this morning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern. We'll probably get more headlines out of that call when the CFO and CEO, Jamie Dimon speak and that may very well move the stock further.</p><p>We are awaiting results from Citigroup and Wells Fargo later this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Futures this morning indicating a pretty much a gain at the start of trading for the Dow Industrials, although it has been a mixed situation there as you can see, Futures are showing a gain on the Dow. We'll get that board fixed for you.</p><p>We had gains across the board yesterday, the momentum continues. The S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ closed at all-time highs yesterday. As you see, the Dow was up a quarter of a percent, the NASDAQ was up better than one percent and the S&amp;P up three quarters of one percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this. European indices right now are showing a mixed story. FT-100 is basically flat in London, up a fraction, the CAC Quarante in Paris is down three points and the DAX Index's Germany is up nine points, so very much a fractional move across Europe this morning.</p><p>Asia overnight, mixed performances overnight and the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up three quarters of one percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning but first, our top story this half an hour, a win for democracy this weekend. This weekend's presidential election in Taiwan dealing a major blow to Beijing.</p><p>Pro-democracy candidate Tsai Ing-wen winning the election, strengthening the island's commitment and defending itself against mainland China's influence and the authoritarianism there.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted his congratulations saying this; the U.S. congratulates Dr. Tsai Ing-wen on her re-election in Taiwan's presidential election. Taiwan once again demonstrates the strength of its robust Democratic system. Thank you President Tsai for your leadership and developing a strong U.S. partnership, wrote Secretary Pompeo.</p><p>Joining me right now is U.S.-Taiwan Business Council president Rupert Hammond-Chambers. And Rupert, it's good to have you this morning. Thanks very much for being here.</p><p>RUPERT HAMMOND-CHAMBERS, PRESIDENT, U.S.-TAIWAN BUSINESS COUNCIL: Thank you, Maria, it's my pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So your reaction to the election victory this weekend and what that means for the rest of the world, in particular the U.S. and its dealings with China?</p><p>HAMMOND-CHAMBERS: Yes, it was -- Tsai Ing-wen's reelection was not a surprise. The margin of her victory perhaps was slightly -- she really had a significant gap between her and Han Kuo-yu who she defeated. I think that perhaps the biggest surprise in the election was the parliamentary results where her party retained control of the legislative chamber and unifies governance on both ends and the legislature and the executive branch.</p><p>For the states, we retain an important partner in the Asia-Pacific that President Trump and his administration has been working with closely on democracy promotion, on the economic challenge of a predatory China and on the security challenge of a predatory China. Taiwan has been tremendous for U.S. policy, Indo-Pacific policy and we're going to see continuity for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, it was amazing to look at the pictures this weekend. You had people rallying in the streets in Taiwan and then you had people rallying in the streets in Hong Kong, holding the American flag. You even had Iranians in Iran for a different reason obviously, pushing back against the authoritarianism in Iran.</p><p>I sat down with former White House strategist Steve Bannon this weekend on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES\" over on Fox News. And he noted the incredible signs that he saw about pro-democracy movements across the world. Watch this. Got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Reaction to what's taking place across the world?</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER STRATEGIST, WHITE HOUSE: What, this is the Trump doctrine, whether it's in Hong Kong, the ballot box in Taiwan, in the streets of Tehran, freedom and democracy. This is what --</p><p>President Trump has stood up to the Chinese Communist Party, the dictators in Beijing. He stood up to the mullahs in Tehran and now you're seeing it, you're seeing the people, whether it's the ballot box in Hong Kong or in the protests. It has had a sweeping victory there a couple of weeks ago. A landslide victory for the -- for the freedom and Democracy Party in Taiwan with a record turnout and this is what the Chinese Communist Party is trying to put their thumb on the scale.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rupert, what do you say?</p><p>HAMMOND-CHAMBERS: He's absolutely right. Mr. Trump's policy towards China has been a huge breath of fresh air over the last three years after very difficult times under Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama.</p><p>And the promotion of democracy, a recalibration of our economic relationship with the Chinese was badly needed. Their predatory approach to America, to the world indeed, the theft of intellectual property and trade secrets had us on the back foot.</p><p>And also, we as a country, we're not handling our relationship with the Chinese well. There was self-censorship in our approach with the Chinese, we felt we needed to appease them to gain narrow -- to gain progress and narrow goals.</p><p>With Mr. Bush in his second term it was with the North Koreans, with Mr. Obama, particularly in his second term it was with the Paris accord. And of course, the Chinese made gains across the board when it was clear we were focused on only a single issue.</p><p>So, it has been a breath of fresh air. We've made progress on democracy, on economic engagement and critically as well in our security relationships in the -- in the region.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And not only that, but you're seeing the U.S. continuing its relationship with Taiwan, selling them arms. This is obviously to the chagrin of the Chinese. What does that relationship look going forward look like between Taiwan and the United States and how does this signing of the phase one deal with China impact all of this that's happening tomorrow?</p><p>Secretary Mnuchin making a big deal, a big splash of the signing of this phase one deal tomorrow in Washington.</p><p>HAMMOND-CHAMBERS: On security cooperation, Maria, Mr. Trump has rightly demanded that our friends and allies take up more responsibility for their own security.</p><p>And President Tsai in her first term jumped at that opportunity. She's raised real defense spending, she has modernize her arm forces, she has bought modern equipment from the United States such as F-16 fighters, modern tanks and that has improved the security in the Taiwan strait. And we can expect President Tsai to continue to improve her security footprint and look for ways to cooperate with the United States in an Indo-Pacific security framework.</p><p>On the -- on the phase one trade deal, I think the important thing to recognize here from a Taiwan angle is the United States will need partners in executing some of the trade deal, particularly in the areas of intellectual property and trade secrets.</p><p>Taiwan's role in the global supply chain is absolutely critical. Their tier one systems integrators like Hon Hai Foxconn and perhaps the most important technology company, few people have ever heard of, Taiwan Semiconductor, these companies are essential to our economic health and well-being. So we'll need partners to pressure the Chinese to live up to their obligations.</p><p>Obviously, the Chinese are very good at headline commitments, making big splashy announcements but over time do they stick to those deals, do they actually do what they say they're going to do? That will be where the rubber meets the road. Taiwan will be an important part in ensuring the Chinese meet their commitments.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. I mean, you've got the pressure from Taiwan and then you've got the pressure from Hong Kong as well. Look at those pictures of the Hong Kongers in the street, they're holding up the American flag. Look at those picture of the Taiwanese in the street, that ha -- that has not go unnoticed by the Chinese.</p><p>HAMMOND-CHAMBERS: Absolutely not. But I would -- I would caution any view that the Chinese would make any significant or any change candidly in their approach to Hong Kong. They appear to be doubling down. They've just appointed a hard-liner as their representative in Hong Kong and with Taiwan too.</p><p>We fully expect China to double down on its policies towards Taiwan to constrict and restrict its international space, to undermine its physical security and to coerce it economically.</p><p>And our hope is that the Trump administration will look at Taiwan as a key ally in the Indo-Pacific area, to look at a bilateral trade agreement as a priority in Tsai's second term and hope -- and hopefully moving forward here with Mr. Trump and his government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there. Rupert Hammond-Chambers. It's great to get your insights, sir. Thanks very much, Rupert.</p><p>HAMMOND-CHAMBERS: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rupert Hammond-Chambers joining us there.</p><p>We'll take a break. When we come back, Astros fired, the front office Major League Baseball coming down, one of last year's World Series contenders, the fallout out next.</p><p>And then Adam Sandler thanking Mama.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KATHY BATES, ACTRESS: You don't understand me, Mr. Coach Klein, my boy is all I've got left.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. The star's response to his Oscar's snub right after this. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Hong Kong's leader is pledging support. We want to tell you more about this story because we are looking at a new support this morning coming out of -- coming out of the situation. We will get more on that coming up because Hong Kong's support, Carrie Lam is pledging to help the struggling economy. Of course, the economy under severe pressure given the fact that we are seeing really people in the streets, in the millions, day after day. Cheryl Casone with the details now in headlines, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, well said, Maria. And it is a story we've been watching for a while on this program. So Carrie Lam, as you said, she's promising 1.3 billion in relief measures to prop up the economy there.</p><p>Now, the region's sinking into recession for the first time in a decade amid months of anti-government protests. And this new spending proposal brings total stimulus to 4.5 billion, just since the summer there. Big story we're watching obviously Maria, is Hong Kong.</p><p>We're also watching this, Major League Baseball handing down a major fine. The League has suspended Houston Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A. J. Hinch for sign stealing. The team owner then fired them both after the announcement yesterday. The League also fining the team $5 million. This after the World Series appearance folks.</p><p>Well, only one tiger could win and the LSU Tigers defeated the Clemson Tigers, 42-25 last night, that makes them the new College Football champions. President Trump and the First Lady attended and were greeted with cheers as they walked out onto the field.</p><p>Now the president even hung out with actor Vince Vaughn which caused some controversy. Some on social media calling for Vaughn to be canceled.</p><p>Well, finally this, no nomination, no problem. Adam Sandler taking the comedic route over his Oscar snub. Here's what he tweeted. Bad news, Sandman gets no love from the Academy. Good news, Sandman can stop wearing suits. Congrats to all my friends who got nominated, especially Mama. He's referring to Kathy Bates there, that's Mama.</p><p>A lot of buzz he was going to get nominated Maria, for \"Uncut Gems\". It was a serious role for him and we talked about it on the show that the -- he had done this amazing job on \"Uncut Gems\", but Oscar voters didn't seem to care, Maria. Oh, well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: So Kathy Bates responded to that Adam Sandler tweet. And this is he -- she played his mother, Mama, in \"The Waterboy\". And his name -- here's what Kathy Bates said on Twitter. And I'm reading it in maybe Mama's voice. I love you my Bobby Boucher. You was robbed but Mama loves you. I learned a new urban slang word for you. You the goat, not the one we eat at home, son. That's the response from Kathy Bates. It exploded on Twitter. I retweeted it yesterday. God love her and God -- and God love Adam Sandler.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was very funny. He's one of the best for sure.</p><p>All right, quick break, and then when we come back, we are looking at tackling cholesterol, how one company is looking at new ways to help solve the problem. He is here with me at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We are talking about tackling cholesterol, heart disease is the number one killer in the United States every year. That remains the case for years. Millions of Americans are struggling to get their cholesterol levels down. One company now waiting for FDA approval on two drugs to help patients get the results they need with me right now.</p><p>Joining me right now is Esperion Therapeutics Incorporated CEO, Tim Mayleben. Tim, it's great to have you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>TIM MAYLEBEN, CEO, ESPERION THERAPEUTICS INCORPORATED: Good morning, I'm very pleased to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When would you expect approval from the FDA on your first drug? Let's talk about that because you've got two new medications. This is a very important topic for so many people out there.</p><p>MAYLEBEN: Sure, so we're expecting approval from FDA as early as next month. So this is a very timely discussion for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about the drugs.</p><p>MAYLEBEN: So our drugs are -- well, new medicines to lower bad cholesterol and one of the things that I would highlight, in fact, surprises most people is there are 18 million people in the U.S. who still need something additional to help them get their bad cholesterol levels down to a healthy level. And I could break that down for you into two groups. One --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because there are other medications already on the market, right? Like statins, like Lipitor.</p><p>MAYLEBEN: I was just going to mention that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's the most common, right, Lipitor?</p><p>MAYLEBEN: Statins, they are great drugs for most people, eight or nine out of 10 people who take a statin do great. But those people need a non-statin means for getting additional LDL cholesterol lowering or bad cholesterol lowering.</p><p>But probably the biggest group are people who can't or won't take statins because of side effects and they need a non-statin pill to get their cholesterol to a healthy level. And this is beyond the diet and exercise that we all strive to do, of course.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's terrific. What about diet, how important is that? Obviously --</p><p>MAYLEBEN: Diet is fundamental, all of us need to obviously be on a good diet but most of us can't achieve a healthy cholesterol level on diet alone or exercising and that's where medicines like ours would come in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And real quick on your burn rate, you are obviously going to see profitability once you get the -- with the drugs approved. When would profitability happen and what's your burn rate on cash?</p><p>MAYLEBEN: So we expect within a couple of years that we could be profitable. As I mentioned earlier, this is a really high unmet need. There's a lot of patients who -- 18 million people who need non-statin ways of lowering their bad cholesterol and we think --</p><p>And you know, I would highlight too, this is going to be surprising, but our pills to lower bad cholesterol, they're non-statin pills, will be the first non-statin pills approved to lower bad cholesterol in almost two decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, that is fantastic. Tim, it's a really important topic. We appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.</p><p>MAYLEBEN: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching the approval process at the FDA, Tim Melben -- Mayleben rather, pardon me.</p><p>We want to get right to Jackie DeAngelis, Wells Fargo is out, it is a miss as we're looking at these numbers right here. Jackie, over to you.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you Maria. And Sharp contrast to what we saw with JPMorgan , this is a big miss, $0.93 adjusted in earnings, expectation was $1.12. A revenue miss as well. So both top and bottom line, 19.9 billion is the actual number, the estimate was for 20.14 billion.</p><p>Some commentary coming from the CEOs, CFO, rather, saying that some of the expenses were too high, becoming efficient is a top priority here. So this is a stock to watch today, although it's trading a little bit higher right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Jackie, thank you. We will be right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020011402cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y04-4321-DXH2-654V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7703\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

This is our 37th Annual Conference that's been held here at this same hotel, believe it or not, for all those years.</p><p>Just a couple of housekeeping items for you. For folks that want the WiFi password, it's bancanalyst18. Banc is with a C, not a K. I'd also like to point out that this has been a challenging year with a number of banks canceling at the last minute. And so Flagstar, who's supposed to present tomorrow, had to cancel this week so we'll have an extended coffee break tomorrow morning. And just a reminder, tonight's dinner at the Museum of Science, Bank of America being hosted by <person><nameText>Brian Moynihan, </nameText></person>Chairman and CEO of Bank of America. Buses will depart from the lobby starting at 5:30 and taking us over there. The last bus will depart about 6:15. Cocktail hour will be from 6:00 to 6:45. Dinner from 6:45 to 8:15, and then buses back here to the hotel.</p><p>We're going to kick it off, as we've done in years' past, with JPMorgan, and it's a fireside chat. So we'll get started in a couple of seconds here.</p><p>Thank you again, everyone, for joining us. Today, we have Lori Beer. She's JPMorgan's Global Chief Investment Officer. She joined JPMorganin 2014, and prior to joining JPMorgan, she was the Executive Vice President of Specialty Businesses and Information Technology for WellPoint Inc. As many of you know, JPMorganhas one of the largest technology budgets in the U.S. banking system. She manages more than $10 billion with nearly 50,000 technologists in her group. She supports the JPMorgan ChaseRetail, Wholesale and also the Wealth Management businesses. Lori, welcome.</p><p>LORI ANN BEER, CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO.: Thank you. Nice to be here.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: We'd like to start off with some questions about scale and competition. And similar to other fireside chats from last year, if there are questions from the audience, please raise your hand as we are talking and we'll get to your question.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Maybe, Lori, you can share with us what are the drivers of scale across the JPMorgan, from a technology standpoint at JPMorgan.</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: So when we think about scale across technology, it actually starts with the incredible scale we have in our businesses. So incredible scale, both on the Consumer side as well as the Wholesale side. So when I think about scale, for example, on wholesale payments, we process $5 trillion a day. The scale around the processing, just the infrastructure and environments to process and move that money across the globe, we have to have incredible scale, resiliency and infrastructure to support businesses like that.</p><p>And on the Consumer side, being in 50% of all U.S. households really scale on a digital platform, the real front-facing platforms that our customers engage with us. So if you then again transfer that to scale across digital platforms, we also have to have incredible scale around how do we protect not only JPMorgan, but our customers as well. And I think part of it, as we've talked about earlier, we spend over $700 million in cybersecurity alone. So incredible scale around cybersecurity, how we protect our customers. Incredible scale around our systems and solutions.</p><p>I think another dimension of scale is the scale of creating new ideas and bringing them to market at scale. So every time we want to innovate on a new consumer feature in our digital lab, the ability to take that from small proof-of-concept where we're vetting that with a consumer into production, the scale [across] the number of digital customers that we have is also another way to think about scale in our business. And then, of course, our data assets. We have incredible scale across our data assets, which is going to be incredibly important as we think about how to use that data in more of the world where we start becoming more of an AI-driven or insight-driven company as well. So those are some ways I think about scale.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: So to follow-up on your comment, how long will it typically take to go from proof-of-concept to actually having a product that's out there for the customers to use?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: From the consumer space, we actually have tried what is typically talked about as agile teams. And these are small teams of individuals that work on very specific features in the digital space. We actually, in our digital labs, one is in New York in Five Manhattan West. We'll bring our customers in, we'll bring consumers in and we'll test the products. So we could actually deploy software on a pretty regular basis. In fact, doing so in the digital environment, we can deploy weekly. And sometimes now when you look at the amount of change that we are implementing across the broadest estate of JPMorgan, it factors into about deploying a change a minute. And that's something we are continuing to increase. Just when you take the total number of changes that we do and think about that, that scale. So a lot of changes going into the environment on a regular basis.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Got you. When you think about your technology budget of close to $11 billion, what do you focus on for that spend? What is the mix involved in, in terms of what strategic versus maintenance?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes, so I think we generally talk about $5 billion we spend as investments, and I'll talk about that in a minute. But what's really important when you think about just the underlying infrastructure and data storage and data centers, day-to-day, our data centers that we have to have just to support our customers every day, there's a significant investment in just that alone. And then when you talk about the investments that we make, we like to think about those that are short-term investments. So how are we transforming the digital, anything that's on a digital paradigm, whether it's to support consumers or an asset wealth management, even some of the client-facing institutional capabilities that we are building. Anything in that digital world where we're trying due to very bring value to customers faster, that is an area where we think more about what are the short-term iterations, as I mentioned earlier. And then there's some of the longer-term strategic investments around how are we transforming our payments business, the underlying engines that transform our payments business, our custody fund services businesses. And we also like to think about investments about research and development. The pace of technology is changing faster than it ever has. And so we're already thinking about what are some of the next-generation capabilities that may, both on the business side, new products like whether it's Sapphire or new products like Finn, whether that's going to be long-term, we want to look at those from an innovation perspective. We also want to think about new emerging technologies. Even quantum computing or partnering with IBM to look at some -- already taking some of the traditional derivative processing algorithms and saying how does that perform on a quantum algorithm? So that's the other extreme of R&amp;D. So customer-facing R&amp;D and also some of the pure, more technology R&amp;D. And so it's always important that we take, say, about 10% of some of the investments that we make and focus on those kinds of things, either business innovation or R&amp;D or technology R&amp;D.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: One of the questions that this group often has to determine or answer is how the banks are differentiating themselves in this area. Obviously, you guys are spending a considerable amount of money. So when you look at it, how do you differentiate yourself from the competition? And how can others remain competitive?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes. So I think so one of the ways that we differentiate ourselves, I think, certainly our customers vote, especially in the consumer side. And if you think about that we are the.</p><p>(technical difficulty)</p><p>mobile app, also the one that was the highest rating, in J.D. Power, we actually moved up to the #1 position. So certainly, customers, all of our Net Promoter Score across those Chase products, we've seen increases in them. So we are always, especially in a consumer business, looking at how our consumers are voting with the capabilities that we're delivering. So I think business performance clearly as well as consumer experience, and we like to keep those front and center. On the same time, on the wholesale side, our businesses have performed well. And I think it's always constantly looking at where is the market moving. What are the capabilities that are truly competitively differentiating, focusing on putting our investments there and not being afraid of if it's not a competitively differentiating capability, we'll partner for that. We'll use a third-party solution for that. So really being disciplined. And I think a lot of it, if you think about it, everybody's got -- every industry has a digital strategy. Every industry is thinking about how to become AI driven. The key to success beyond the strategy is talent and execution, and that's where we spend a lot of time focusing on, how do we get the top technology, the talent, the best data scientists. How do we make sure that we streamline decision-making so that we can get new capabilities from ideas to the market faster.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Yes, question?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I've got a question about the Wholesale side. If you can talk about which bits of Wholesale is transforming faster, and which bits of Wholesale are most open to disruption, if you're open about it.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: If you can repeat the question?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes, so which bits of Wholesale are transforming faster. Which bits of Wholesale are open to disruption. So some of the areas that we're really focusing around the Wholesale is the transformation of the underlying payments ecosystem. Not necessarily the execution of payments itself, but what are the value-added clients capabilities that you can put around that if we're trying to serve our customers? And so we've put a lot of innovation, not only transforming the underlying engine that processes payments. We've got a lot of work going on in that space, but how does a Treasury Service client -- how do we give them the data and the insights? How do we change the way they manage their accounts? Traditionally in that business, you would think about lots of different accounts, and we're giving them a virtual account structure where they really have, through the use of data, we can actually allow them to break that account up into different views without physically having to have multiple accounts. And so the areas that we're going to watch very carefully, because there's also a lot of regulation on the Wholesale space that also creates not necessarily a lot of the new entrants, if you would say. But we obviously watch the intersection point with our clients. We want to make sure that we're maintaining that rich experience with our clients. [Cost and Fund] services has been another area where we've put a lot of investment into those businesses. And I think you saw we won the BlackRock deal, successfully migrated all their business seamlessly without disruption onto our platforms. At the same time, because we're making the investments and we have the scale, I think a lot of folks in that business are saying, \"Do I really want to do some of that middle-office processing? Or do I want to take advantage of the investments we're making?\" And you saw some of the next-generation things we're even talking about there, which are starting to expose data analytic capabilities to our customers for them to leverage. So you go from something that was processing a business to creating a platform to start offering new products and capabilities, like data and analytics, to our customers in a different way.</p><p>And, of course, the markets businesses. We continue to electronify in those markets businesses and in the equity space. And, again, I think you can track our growth and successes as we come into the top 3 in the equity space. So those will be some of the areas in the wholesale side I would point out. And Wealth Management, I didn't mention but, obviously, we've been spending a lot of time digitizing in the Wealth Management space. You Invest with one of our interesting products where we brought the scale of the platforms together, our consumer platform with Wealth Management, created a new experience for consumers that brought You Invest to market.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: If I could just follow up with (inaudible)?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes. So we're very...</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Repeat the question again.</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Oh, sorry. So cash management. Generally, just to paraphrase, clients complain about the speed and the processing of banks when you're going cross-border as well as -- so how are we thinking about that? And also Goldman has been talking about getting into the cash management business. So again, to respond to that. So a couple of things I would say. The historical cash management platforms for us and many banks were more mainframe or more older technology type platforms. We embarked on a journey. We call it Graphite, which we were building the modern architecture, cloud-based architecture. And one of the reason that's critically important is if you look at the flow of how money moves and payments, it's very spiky. So it fits -- if you think about -- one of the benefits of a cloud-based architecture is that it allows you to only consume what you need. And so if I'm only consuming if it's flatlined, and then it spikes up and I only need to consume, compute or infrastructure at those peaks, it actually allows me to reduce the cost of how I process a payment transaction, so that's the cost aspect of it. If you think about all the work around real-time payment in the U.S., that also, given some of that regulation, is also -- on the modern platform we rebuilt how we thought about processing and payments. The other thing you have to think about when you think about the core cash management capabilities is all the supporting processes around it. So fraud, for example. We've seen an increase in wholesale payments in the fraud space. And so one of the things we've done through the use of technology is how do we get smarter at being able to detect? This is actually a place we're applying machine learning, detect a real fraud from white noise. Because again, from a customer's perspective, paying their supplier across the globe, they don't want us to necessarily slow down the payment. But the other processes we have to wrap around that are fraud, sanctions, anti-money laundering. And so not only do you have to innovate the process of processing a payment, but how you actually transact across border and how you support all those supplemental processes as well. And I think Goldman's getting into cash management because there's a great opportunity there, and we see it too. And we feel really good about how our technology is positioning and also growing those -- as you can see, our numbers in those businesses -- growing those businesses as well. And those are rich, deep customer experiences. And the key for us there beyond -- similar to consumer. Not just similar to consumer, because you're right. Consumer trends set the expectation in these institutional wholesale businesses, which is they want real-time data. They want it at speed and that's some of the things we're doing as we innovate even how we think about payment. So we hear the term API thrown out, but it's really about how do you more directly connect with your clients. So think about a case where a client may have SAP, and through their SAP platform, they want to process the payment. Instead of having a back office to enter the payment into JPMorgan, we can directly connect through an API. And that makes it much more of a seamless experience and allows them to take out some of the back-office processing that they have to support. And so those are just some of the examples and ways. So I think, obviously, as Goldman loves to expand the breadth of their businesses, they're looking at cash management as one opportunity. We have the benefit of having significant scale in that business already, so that as we're able to do these innovations, we're able to then apply them at scale across our customer base and that's also allowing us to acquire new customers as well.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Speaking of payments, obviously, Zelle has been very successful by the banks that have introduced it. Does Zelle -- which is a consumer P2P as we all know, is there any application for Zelle on the commercial side that you see down the road?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Looking -- there's always sort of -- I think time will tell how much that will take place versus -- there are a little, fewer different characteristics, but again, I think those are some of the ways that we can facilitate more direct payments across. And I think if we remain focused on feeding that and making it a seamless process -- but I think time will actually tell in terms of -- I think companies certainly are looking at peer-to-peer payments in the business-to-business space. But again, we are -- we have a lot of the rails that are there today, so we can also continue to think about how we want to innovate around that.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Great. One of the other questions we often wrestle with is how, obviously, you've got bank competitors in this technology area, but how do you think about disruption from the fintech companies and other nontraditional financial companies?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Here's the way we think about it. Because a lot of these fintech companies are parts of our ecosystem today. So if you think about some of the examples, as we've been working on transforming our mortgage experience, deeply integrated in that is something called Roostify, and that's a fintech company. As we try to simplify the billing in our commercial banking businesses, we partnered with a company called Bill.com. So many of these companies -- and why do we look at them and how do we make those choices? Because I think that's important to understand. Fintechs are very good at taking a simple problem and simplifying it. And a problem that has been a consumer or customer-facing challenge and just streamlining and simplifying it and focusing on that and speed. Speed because they have a little bit more of a greenfield technology environment. The challenge they often face is size and scale, so especially the size and scale of JPMorgan, and understanding the complexity of the regulatory environment. So just to give you an example, when you think about payments, somebody trying to come in to the Wholesale payment space, we have over 200 regulators that regulate that business. So the complexity and the size and scale of trying to deliver something new without understanding the regulatory implications around things like sanctions, money laundering, et cetera as well is really highly complex. And then understanding also how to achieve size and scale when you're dealing with the numbers. So fintechs for us are an opportunity, sometimes, to put it as part of our end-to-end customer experience and deliver solutions, such as mortgage, as I mentioned, with Roostify. And sometimes we bring them inside. We have a program called Fintech In-Residence. We also noticed this problem. By the way, given we're an investment bank, we think a healthy fintech ecosystem is also really important to grow new companies as well. And many times, if they work for us in part of our ecosystem, we can help those companies scale. But our Fintech In-Residence program was created because we saw these challenges around how do I understand the size and complexity of JPMorgan. How do I understand the regulatory requirements that also may surround that? So we actually bring the fintech inside our walls. They're generally very early-stage companies. We put our technology and senior business leadership around them. We allow them access into our data and technology environment, obviously, with all the right controls in place. And then we help them incubate. They maintain their IP. We choose, ultimately, if we want to invest. And we had 1 company, it's the company called Mosaic that actually went through our Fintech In-Residence that ultimately we deployed in production. Sometimes we decide, like WePay, that it was such a differentiating capability that we wanted to acquire them. And in that scenario, we acquired WePay. Sometimes we just choose to invest.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: One of the other questions that we wrestle with is how do you attract and retain tech talent at a bank when you're competing against the tech companies like Facebook and Google and others? How do you keep those people or how do you attract them?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: We actually are very fortunate that we're able to attract a lot of technology talent. You can imagine with the numbers that we talked about and the fact that our technology investments have been growing, that we hire a lot of talent on an annual basis. One of the things that has been really interesting, when I think about the top senior levels in the technology organization that we've been hiring, about 25%, sometimes that swings up a little bit higher, are coming from technology companies. So there is actually a myth that we can't hire from technology companies. In fact, the in AI space, since we're very early stage at taking some of the capabilities we have there and scaling them more broadly, we were able to bring a top executive from Google, Apoorv Saxena, that's helping us build out our frameworks. And when you think about Apoorv, you think about this other talent of why they would want to join us. When you're at a tech company, it's generally focused on a few products, but they don't necessarily have the data and they don't necessarily have the scale [as] JPMorgan. So for some people that talk about why they came to JPMorgan, it's really about, I want to solve a really hard -- technologists are generally wired to wanting to create value, a purpose. How do I solve a really hard problem. We have a lot of those really hard problems to solve. We have the data. And at a company like JPMorgan, there's generally 2 kinds of technologists; those that like to create the next technology and those that like to apply it. We actually have both use cases. Sometimes like our Quorum product, we actually have created technology. And other times, of course, we have many applications of applying it. So I think the bigger thing we focus on is how do we keep the talent. So when you think about the top talent in the technology space and the really hot field at cybersecurity. Again, the investments we make and the partnerships we have with all the -- the government are really interesting problems for those in the cybersecurity space. Cloud, cloud skills, data scientists and AI. So we have very special programs around how we attract, retain and develop that type of talent. But that's really -- and talent is so critical. Success in technology, it really -- at the end of the day, technologists are creators of the products and solutions for us. So talent is one of the #1 focuses for us.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: I've got a question. Before the (inaudible)?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Not a revenue center, but we absolutely impact revenue from that perspective. So a couple of things. So $10.8 billion is what you heard from us from Investor Day is what we spent. In terms of -- we made a significant investment this year year-on-year, and there were a couple of reasons for that, which allowed us to put more like $5 billion towards creating new capabilities. We wanted to accelerate into the building out of our digital capabilities, accelerating our payments transformation, custody fund services and make sure that we are making the right investments on things like data as we prepare for -- I mean, the real oil that fuels AI is all about the data. And so really making sure we're getting ahead of understanding the information and data we need to have more of an insight-driven business going forward. So we were very thoughtful about the investments that we wanted to put into this year, but that I would say what's a little bit of a bump. As you think about going forward, I think -- when we're building out data centers, we've got a lot of investments that will continue, but I don't think you -- I think you'll see generally in the same ballpark in that at our Investor Day, we'll share more details. We're still working through the budgeting process now. The thing that I would say is every year, we are able to, through technology, find a lot of efficiencies. So whether that's for Gordon in the consumer business, these things -- you kind of have to connect the dots through these things. So as more and more of these transactions, whether you're talking about an ATM, which has really become a banking kiosk, or in a branch, more of those transactions have become digital. So team has been able to optimize his workforce and operations. Even though the digital cost might have gone up, he's actually been able to bring his operational cost. Now his cost of acquiring a new customer -- it's like, as he talks, it's almost pennies to nothing, right? And so the way I think to think about it is -- and if you look at custody and fund services or some of the Wholesale business in payment, those businesses or equities, those businesses have grown. And a lot of the reason for their growth is a lot of the investments that we've made in technology that are pulling through. We try to be very disciplined. As you look at cloud, for example, over time, a hybrid cloud strategy, which means we are using infrastructure. Cloud really is just servers in our data center. It really isn't much more mysterious than that, but it allows you to get scale. So we can scale inside our 4 walls as we consume infrastructure. Cloud just gives you another way to share that scale more in a multitenant kind of environment. And so as we consume more infrastructure, because the more you want to do with data, the more you want to do with AI, you're actually needing more ability to process. Rather than building that up in those cases on the inside of our walls, that allows us to use the resources you have in a cloud-like environment. And so I think one of the ways to look at it is business-outcome based. What's the marginal cost to add a new customer as we look at digital account opening? How are we performing and growing businesses? What is the over -- how are our customers rating us from a Net Promoter Score of an overall experience? Because a lot of that is being brought together to the investments in technology.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Yes, over here.</p><p>JAMES HANNA, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, MILLENNIUM MANAGEMENT LLC: It's Jimmy Hanna. So I'm trying to (inaudible)?</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Can you repeat the question?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes, so really the question's around go a little bit deeper on some of the things you're doing to continue to optimize the investments, the thing that I alluded to, and what our sort of some of the next things that we should be thinking about. Let me start with saying -- I was just out in the Valley about a month ago. The pace of change of technology is changing more than -- actually, the paradigm is shifting a bit. It's changing faster than we've ever seen it. So the one way I would look at it is the ball is constantly moving in terms of new technologies coming to the market that allows us to lower the cost of processing on infrastructure. What's allowing this ability to do AI now, AI has been around forever. I always remind people, it's been around since before I was born. What's matured is actually some of the machine -- some of the algorithms is maturing and they're being democratized. So I can go out on to Google and use TensorFlow, just as an example, and get access to machine learning. Because I can use the cloud, I can do -- I can take my data and I can do that in a much more cost-effective way that I spin up the compute. This is very intensive to do, AI, and spin it down when I don't need it anymore. So it's really driving AI, ML. And now, you actually need more data. You actually need more infrastructure, but what's actually allowing you to do that at a reasonable cost is the convergence of better technologies around the data, better technologies around the cloud, companies -- large companies getting comfortable to have a hybrid strategy where I use some internal capabilities but I can also use the same ones that are available to any fintech or emerging companies. So you what I'm seeing? The paradigm's shifting. And so the average lifespan of technology is actually reducing. And it's really actually a positive thing in the sense that there's constant innovation around. So I don't think we would say that we're ever going to be done. Some of the things that we're focusing on in the short term is we are definitely focusing on the infrastructure space. How do you take some of the traditional ways they consume infrastructure and you move to a hybrid cloud paradigm? Remember, cloud is just servers in a data center, but what I am really talking about is instead of the old days where you ran an application on a physical piece of infrastructure, you now share infrastructure. Before, from a -- if I was a software engineer, right, it actually becomes agnostic to physically where my software is running. But what does that translate into, the efficiency of my ability to run it is increasing, but the model's getting complicated to figure out. Do you see what I mean? That's what I'm just trying to say. The paradigm is shifting because companies used to have data centers full of servers. And so one of the things you got to think about is it also helps drive speed. Now I don't have to wait to stand up a data center. If I want to do an innovation, I can just open up -- so you have to balance the cost with how it's also helping accelerate the speed of innovation. And I think in the shorter term, the technology you're going to see that help the most is AI, machine learning, which includes many paradigms like natural language processing, et cetera. So that's one way to think about it. So we're still looking. I would say we focus a lot on building out platforms. So let me give you an example. When we -- we were able to build Finn in 6 months or less because Finn was built on the Chase Mobile platform. We created a new digital bank solution targeted at the millennial. Still really in its innovation R&amp;D phase, if you will, but we were able to build a lot of that based on the core capabilities we had in Chase Mobile. So if you think about it, even though Finn has a really creative user design, when I'm looking at debt account balance, it's actually calling the same transaction the Chase Mobile. So think about that leverage and reuse. So the other paradigm that's shifting in technology is the building out of platforms. You hear them call it building out of micro-services. We used to build technology, in the older days, of this big -- you hear monolithic platforms. Now everything is being broken down into components and services, but that allows the speed of innovation to create a new customer experience. That's what technology companies, like an Amazon, is really good at, right? They take the core problem, they break it down. They're able to stitch a new customer experience together, and that's the path we're going down on too. So as we continue to do that work, as we continue to -- so it's less -- you'll hear us talk less about application consolidation. It's more about how do you build those strategic micro services. So when I want to build the next Finn or the next You Invest, You Invest was the same way, built on assets we already have that serves other customer purposes. That's the leverage of platform. That's the leverage of scale. Does that help?</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible) we often hear is that how can a regional bank compete with JPMorgan (inaudible).</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: It actually -- from -- if you look at it from -- so the question is, talk a little about the disadvantages. And one of the notions was for regional banks, it's hard to compete. You could also argue, if you think about APIs and open banking and cloud, et cetera, it could level the playing field. But one interesting thing where it has changed, if you thought historically, if I needed to do a big application rationalization to get to the strategic state, I'll use payments again, we would have typically -- here's a target state -- here's a system. We're going to shut this system down. We're going to migrate it, and you had those [Big Bang] system migrations. It actually allows us to do the same thing. By applying those types of architectures, it allows us to isolate the brownfield, if you will, and more quickly deliver. I don't have to wait to do a system migration before I can start delivering new customer capabilities, and that's exactly, in some of the spots around payments and custody and fund services, we were able to innovate while we were doing migrations. And the goal is obviously how do you make those migrations seamless and transparent? When I think about the smaller players, certainly for a fintech or smaller regional player, you'll probably see them more aggressively go to the cloud or go to some of these other capabilities. The other pieces that I think are also critically important -- this is a business of trust. So the investments that they can afford to make in things like cybersecurity, the scale, the talent. We can compete on talent with some of the big tech companies. Some of the smaller players can't. One of the things that we're really focused on is making sure we can push decision-making down to the right level. So how do you find that balance of an organization that has incredible scale? That they too can push appropriate decisions down, so those teams can move as quick as those digital teams that I talked about. Those are the things that we're really focusing on. How do we set the right framework so decision making can happen at the speed, so that we can innovate at the speed we need to for our customers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: 15 years ago, we started a lot of it. It was all centered on cross-selling. And one of our customer add was (inaudible).</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: So the question is we used to talk a lot about cross-selling, and in the shorter term, I'm paraphrasing again, but in the shorter term, we focused a little bit more on building the rails, the digital, the security, all those kinds of things and is that still happening around knowing your customer and knowing the full set of their capabilities? And the answer is actually yes, it is. And so historically, when you thought about being in 50% of U.S. households with Chase products, we're not necessarily in 50% -- we're not in 50% U.S. households with every product. And even think about -- when you think about that customer experience, when we're trying to certify that someone has the credit, whether it's for an auto loan, credit card, et cetera, we can really transform the way we think about it. We actually have been investing, and again, this is important for multiple reasons, but one of the reasons is for the one that you mentioned. It's also important we start talking about leveraging our data in the AI world. But we're actually creating like a One Chase. So what is all the data you know about Lori Beer? And so when I go to engage with you, you understand my credit worthiness. You understand what might be the next best product that's relevant to me, not the advertisement that's coming across the banner, but what's a relevant product to me. Because the trend that's actually happening, which is why we need to understand these rich data insights about an individual, both internal and publicly available information, is an expectation that's a richer, personalized experience. And one of the ways, whether you're talking on the consumer side or the wholesale side, you can deliver a richer personalized experience, whether it's creating products, managing your products, et cetera, is about the leverage of data and knowing about you and exposing that. One of the reasons we try to seed the team with some of these resources I talked about earlier, when you look at some of these big tech companies, they're really good at that. And part of it is because they were built greenfield. And one of the things that they did was really understanding the data at every interaction point with the consumer, regardless of product. And that's what we really have been building to facilitate a richer, personalized experience going forward.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: We have time for one last question. Yes?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED ANALYST: (inaudible)?</p><p>LORI ANN BEER: Yes. So a couple of questions in there. One is it seemed like organizations, big organizations like us, used to want to run everything on the inside? We went through that phase too. Now with public cloud and the maturing of that, are we open to running production workloads on the public cloud? And how do we think about that? And what does that do to the cost structure over time? The one reason, just to give you a little bit more color, we actually do run production workloads on the public cloud today. So -- but we don't for highly confidential data yet. And one of the things, and this is the way we actually work the technology ecosystem, we work very closely with those cloud providers. We visit them regularly. We talk to them. We strategize because we want to make sure that the security controls, our minimum control requirements, can be met. The great thing about at that is because the cloud providers are actually getting it. What they're hearing is big companies are not going to bet on 1 cloud provider. We are going to want the optionality. Remember, the future state as we think about it is the software engineer or the person consuming the technology shouldn't actually have to worry about physically where it's running. And so I want to actually also be able to move some of my workloads across providers to spread it out across those 3 big public cloud providers. By the way, they're building different capabilities too. And if I wanted to take advantage of the fact that Google is going deep in data and that's going to align to my AI strategy, it may change that we innovate there first and then decide to bring it in. So it actually changes the paradigm of how we think about this. So when you think about it, it is a hybrid cloud strategy and a multi-cloud strategy meaning we will still have big data centers for some of our workloads. We haven't gotten comfortable yet. We're never going to push everything -- oh I should never say never. But we're not at a point now in our strategy that we're going to push everything out to the public cloud. What we're really trying to do is take advantage of what's happening there from an innovation perspective. The cost leverage of only consuming what I need -- I can build a smaller footprint, right, as we go to our strategic data centers and leverage when I need. So when we run things like CCAR today, it leverages my internal resources. When it spikes, we can actually burst out to the public cloud. It shuts down. I didn't have to have the headroom on those inside machines to support that. And so that's just a whole different paradigm around how that works. But the one thing which I always caution everybody, especially with AI coming, I think the need for compute, especially with AI models and things going forward, that's more intense. But the good thing is we're trying to mature these capabilities so we can optimize the value of the public cloud as that comes on board versus building all that on the inside too. So that's the way I think about.</p><p>GERARD S. CASSIDY: With that, we've run out of time. Lori, great job. We really appreciate you being here.

Case in point is the latest coverage of JPMorgan Chase's (JPMC) 2019 results. The bank's latest results are stunning, with the fourth-quarter profit soaring to $8.52 billion or $2.57 a share. A year earlier, the bank reported a profit of $7.07 billion or $1.98 per share. It is now one of the most valuable banks in the world (after the Chinese[1]), with a market capitalisation of almost half a trillion dollars ($430 billion), and builds upon a wildly successful decade of market growth, beating all of the banks' US peers. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FTMarCap.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/FTMarCap.jpg</url> Source:The Financial TimesThe Financial Times had two exceptional columns reviewing JPMorgan's success. The first looked at the US banks overall[2], and tracked the fact that the past decade since the financial crisis has been kind to American banks (unlike European banks). America's largest universal and investment banks - Bank of America, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo - have more than doubled their collective profits since 2009. You could put this down to the strength of the American economy, which has seen eleven years of continuous growth, but its more than this. For example, the big banks are eating the small banks deposits, with Bank of America and JPMorgan increasing deposits by 4% and 6% respectively last year, even as economic growth slowed. The FT quotes[3] Mike Mayo, an analyst at Wells Fargo: 'The moats around the largest banks are as deep as they've ever been. That's due to technology and marketing skills, but also due to new regulations that require a good degree of overheads.' And The FT continues: 'Remarkably, banks' return on equity remains near the levels of a decade ago, despite rules requiring them to hold much more capital. Cost-control initiatives have played a key role in this. Bank of America is again a good example: its overhead costs last year were $65bn, $10bn lower than five years earlier, despite higher revenues. 'A decade ago, too, there was much concern that financial start-ups and big tech companies would invade industry territory. But marketplace lenders, social media platforms and other tech groups have, for the most part, ended up partnering with banks rather than displacing them and why has JPMorgan outperformed all the others by such a large margin? It came out of the crisis with fewer holes in its balance sheet than Citi or Bank of America, and unlike Wells Fargo, has not had any major scandals. In banking, more capital and fewer mistakes are a potent combination.' Nice. There's then an opinion piece by Tom Braithwaite that expands on JPMC's strengths. Jamie Dimon is causing headaches for rivals \u2014 and himself[4] One line in Tom's piece really strikes the point home about how Europe is languishing and America, particularly JPMC, are steamrolling over the banking world: 'JPMorgan's market capitalisation of $430bn is higher than the combined value of Barclays, Socit Gnrale, Standard Chartered, UniCredit, Credit Suisse, UBS, BBVA, Royal Bank of Scotland, Crdit Agricole, ING and Lloyds.' Wow! Just wow! OK, JPMC is worth less than Apple, Google, Amazon, Tencent and Microsoft, but is worth a lot more than the largest group of European banks. It makes you realise that Europe's banks are now valued about as much as half a Stripe if they're lucky. Shoot. And Tom builds on the earlier point, that it's not just about America's economy. 'The comparative strength of the US economy is helpful, but it cannot be the only explanation. After all, Mr Dimon is also embarrassing Wall Street rival Goldman Sachs, whose once stellar profitshave dimmed[5]and whose new gambits, such asconsumer banking[6],are yet to pay off.  'You can point to JPMorgan's boost from consolidation. Mr Dimonswooped on Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008. But he was only in a position to strike those deals because he had protected his own balance sheet. And if crisis-era acquisitions were all that mattered then Barclays, which picked up the core of Lehman Brothers, and Bank of America, which bought Merrill Lynch and Countrywide, would be worldbeaters too.' In other words, it's all down to having a strong balance sheet, good management, great leadership and a focus upon innovation and regulation in equal balance. Meantime, for all the bleating about disintermediation, disruption, digital transformation and revolution, JPMC is a bank that truly is showing how to deal with all these challenges and find a strategy for success. No wonder they are one of the stars of my new book Doing Digital[7]. Finally, in a third piece[8], The FT interviews Brian Moynihan, the CEO of Bank of America (BoA) over the past decade. Brian doesn't like BoA being compared with JPMC, even though the latter has a valuation a third more than BoA today when, ten years ago, they were neck and neck. He claims that this is because JPMC was far better capitalised as it came out of the crisis although, imho, that's not the answer. I always remember reading a research report in the 2000s about BoA's amazing success at turning customers online when many were struggling. This was due to a time-series analysis the bank performed which discovered little online banking usage in the first six months, as customers didn't trust it. After nine months it picked up however and, after eighteen months, online was the primary customer focus. This led to BoA becoming an internet banking lead in the USA (see end note). Today, BoA is lagging behind JPMC in online, digital and mobile banking. Brian Moynihan: 'We have 38 million digital customers and 29 million-plus mobile customers who grew 10 per cent year over year.' JPMC has almost 52 million digital and 37 million mobile customers. No wonder Mr. Moynihan reckons that Bank of America can double their market share[9]:'Our market share in consumer is probably 12, 13, 14 per cent, depending on who counts\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009The reality is, you could double that.' And they will do this digitally. Not by opening more branches.OPTIONAL READING This is a TowerGroup (now part of Gartner) research note from 2004, written by George Tubin. How Bank of America became the biggest US online bank Coming out of the dot-com boom, brick-and-mortar businesses across all industries were forced to reexamine their online strategies. After the mad dash to gain market share and 'online real estate,' the real economic underlying value of the online channel came under considerable scrutiny. This question was especially difficult for the banking industry with its highly complex delivery system, organizational structure, product mix, and geographical reach. In short, measuring the economic value of the online banking channel is difficult. Unlike most other top-tier US banks, Bank of America was determined to confront this issue head on. Realizing that measuring the profitability or return on investment of the online banking channel directly was fraught with problems, the bank decided to approach this issue from a customer-centric perspective. Rather than trying to determine the value of the online channel in isolation, the bank chose to determine the value of customers that used the online channel compared to those that did not. Online Banking Time Series Analysis Although the approach and results of Bank of America's online customer profitability study have been publicly available for some time, a brief description is warranted for those who may not have had the opportunity to review it. After evaluating approaches to determine the nagging question of profitability of the online channel, Bank of America took a unique approach to determine the answer. Rather than simply comparing the profitability of online customers as a segment to that of offline customers, the bank performed a time series analysis that tracked both online and offline customers over a period of time. Online customers were compared to control groups of customers who were not online, based on several measurements taken over an extended period. To isolate the effects of the online channel on the overall customer relationship, control groups were chosen that had demographic and tenure attributes similar to those of the online group. This analysis was structured to isolate the effects of online banking on customer profitability. Bank of America started collecting this data in late 1998 and completed the first time series analysis in the middle of 2000. The study showed that, after going online, customers actuallybecamemore profitable than their control group counterparts. Put another way, the study determined that online banking led to higher customer profitability. Although online bill pay customers cost more to serve, these costs were more than offset by an increase in account retention rates and an expansion in the number of products used. But the most significant profit driver for online customers proved to be an increase in account balances. That is, the interest income derived from higher account balances produced the most significant lift in customer profitability. After nine months, profitability of the online groups was 5% lower than the profitability of control groups, but by the end of the 31-month period, online customers became 21% more profitable than their offline counterparts. Results of Bank of America Online Bill Pay Customer Time Series Analysis (2001)       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Exhibit-2.jpg\">https://thefinanser.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Exhibit-2.jpg</url> To gain the backing of the entire organization, Bank of America's e-commerce unit realized that it should share the online profitability findings widely. Not only did the bank communicate its findings across the entire organization, but Ken Lewis, Bank of America's CEO, actually presented the bank's findings outside the company. In fact, the presentation is publicly available on the company's Web site. The results of the time series analysis formed the crux of how the bank makes decisions about online banking, including the decision to offer free online banking and bill pay. As a result of this and subsequent studies, Bank of America decided to aggressively pursue projects that would increase online banking adoption and usage across its customer base. Subsequent time series studies with different customer groups have shown similar results. As the technology infrastructure was being improved to support the bank's anticipated growth, the organization focused on overcoming customers' potential misperceptions or objections to online banking. Deeply committed to Quality and Six Sigma approaches, the bank's management believed that by really listening to customers and understanding their needs, the bank could focus on implementing programs to improve customer satisfaction and delight its customers. The organization believed that this approach would lead to broader relationships and, hence, higher customer profitability. The bank used a Six Sigma approach known as 'Voice of the Customer' to understand what customers really wanted in an online banking application and to prioritize projects aimed at removing barriers to customer adoption and usage. This approach allowed the bank to target its marketing and development efforts to areas that would produce tangible results. Further, the bank shared findings from the Voice of the Customer project across the organization to provide a common understanding among the thousands of bank associates. After carefully planning, a Voice of the Customer project involves gathering both solicited and unsolicited input from the customer base. Solicited input came from several sources, including focus groups, online questionnaires, and mail surveys. Unsolicited input came from e-mail, mail, contact centers, and branches. To obtain a comprehensive view of the customer base, the bank ensured that input came from both online and offline sources. Reams of data were then organized and scrubbed to provide a good basis for Voice of the Customer analysis. As with any data analysis project, the first step was to ensure the validity and accuracy of the data to be analyzed. Voice of the Customer analysis proved fruitful The bank was able to translate and prioritize customers' objections to online banking into several categories but discovered that four objections were the most significant barriers to adoption. By concentrating on these top objections or barriers, the bank was able to implement programs and policies that directly addressed the areas that would eventually provide the most benefit to their clients, and henceforth, the bank. Although the bank continues to conduct conducts Voice of the Customer projects and share the analysis across the organization, on its road to 11.2 million customers, the bank needed to overcome these four primary barriers to online banking: Barrier 1: 'Online Banking Costs Too Much' Today, it is fairly common practice for large retail banks to offer online banking for free. However, this was not the case just a few short years ago. Most banks would charge a monthly fee for online banking or online bill payment, or provide it for free with high minimum balance requirements. In May 2002, Bank of America announced it would join the budding movement to provide online banking with bill pay free of charge. This decision removed one of the largest obstacles that kept customers away from banking online: cost. Thanks to the bank's sheer size and market impact, almost the entire industry followed suit and began offering free online banking with bill pay. However, many of the other banks did not fully grasp the impact of this move. They had not performed any kind of detailed customer profitability analysis and did not know the value of their respective online banking programs. Most banks feared that online banking was unprofitable for them to begin with and that giving it away would only make it more unprofitable. But, because the largest retail bank in the US was giving the service away, other banks felt forced to provide the service for free as well. They hoped that Bank of America knew what it was doing and that providing free online banking would somehow provide a benefit. Indeed, Bank of America knew exactly what it was doing when it made the decision to go free. Its time series analysis proved that customers became more profitable as a result of going online. The elimination of online banking and online bill pay fee income was far outweighed by the increased profitability derived from customers banking online. Barrier 2: 'Online Banking Is Not Safe' Online security continues to be a top concern for many consumers, especially in light of the many phishing and spoofing scams that have surfaced across the financial services industry. Even before the recent spate of phishing attacks, consumers were wary of conducting financial transactions online. Consumers continue to believe that simply signing up for online banking could enable a fraudster to gain access to one's username and password and thereby gain access to the account, either by intercepting information during an online banking session or by simply 'hacking' the username and password. Consumers believe that without an online account set-up, they are not vulnerable to this type of fraud. They are unaware that thieves can use stolen identification information to establish an online banking account. In order to make customers more comfortable with banking online, the bank realized it had to stand behind its product. Bank of America was one of the first institutions to offer its customers an online banking guarantee, providing '$0 Liability' for any unauthorized activity originating from online banking. Customers, of course, are required to protect their usernames and passwords, not leave their computer unattended during an online banking session, and promptly notify the bank of any unauthorized activity. Barrier 3: 'Online Banking Is Difficult' Bank of America realized that many consumers stay away from online banking because they fear making mistakes in performing financial transactions. Ordering the wrong book is one thing; accidentally sending your mortgage payment to a shell company in Dubai is another. The bank continues to focus considerable effort on simplifying their customers' online experience from enrollment to transaction execution to cross-sales. In a recent review of top online banking providers, TowerGroup found Bank of America to be clearly in the top tier (along with Citibank and Wells Fargo). The top providers not only provide a higher level of features and functions than their peers but also seem to have a knack for providing highly usable and intuitive user interfaces. Barrier 4: 'There's No Real Need to Bank Online' Other than simple ATM withdrawals, consumers traditionally looked to branch and contact center agents to execute their financial transactions. The checkbook remains a sacred relic and check writing a venerated practice among US consumers. Suggesting that bank clients stop using their dear and trusted friends at the local branch and deprecating the check register are considered heresies in many circles. Yet, online banking promises to replace or supplement traditional banking methods with simple, real-time, 24-hour banking. According to TowerGroup primary market research, approximately 93% of all consumer banking customers continue to visit a bank branch at least once a month. Bank of America realized that the most effective way to convince its client base to try online banking was to do so in their branches. But, to promote online banking in the branches would require the branch staff to fully understand and support this effort. If consumers sensed that the branch staff was not enthusiastic about online banking, or worse, unwilling to use online banking themselves, the response would be clear: 'If bank employees don't use it, why should I?' To encourage the branch associates to use online banking, the bank ran several enticing promotions with prizes, including a PT Cruiser and $10,000. Not surprisingly, in a short time over 80% of all branch associates were using online banking on a regular basis. Because of the genuine enthusiasm for online banking exhibited by the branch staff, in-store enrollment for both existing and new customers showed a marked improvement. Today, the bank generates a greater proportion of new online banking enrollments via the banking centers than via the Web, with the majority of customers being new to the bank.

But to Lori Beer, global chief information officer of JPMorgan, the trend reflects the tide of technology staff who want to solve complex problems in banking, a sector that has the data and the scale to bring large projects to fruition. This contrasts with a more product focus at technology companies, she said in an interview with The Business Times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The bank is also putting significant investment dollar on the table that can rival Big Tech firms, with its global technology spending hitting some US$10.8 billion this year, and as it hires tens of thousands of tech specialists annually.</p><p>With the heavy focus on technology at the bank, there has been greater \"digital fluency\" within the business segments, she added, as banking units seek out staff such as data scientists to figure out how data can solve specific banking problems.</p><p>Ms Beer noted that technology is helping the bank transform the way it interacts with customers, bringing about greater personalisation. Indeed, with the greater use of machine learning, banks such as JPMorgan have been using computer programs that help bankers sieve out the clients that are most likely to take up additional fundraising.</p><p>JPMorgan is more actively engaging financial technology companies as well, with Ms Beer pointing to the bank's in-residence programme that has fintech companies sit with the business teams in the bank to develop new solutions. These fintech residents join the bank for six months, and have access to the bank's facilities and systems.</p><p>The programme also puts the fintech firms in touch with the regulatory environment of banks, including ensuring that the fintech solutions pass cybersecurity standards. Of the US$10.8 billion spent on technology by JPMorgan, about US$700 million goes to cybersecurity.</p><p>\"We have about 100 fintech emerging tech pilots at any given time that we're executing, or partnering on,\" said Ms Beer. \"Operating under intensive regulation adds a whole new complexity. We're used to working with that environment - we're very good at managing risks and controls.\"</p><p>Singapore plays a part in JPMorgan's global technology drive.</p><p>In Singapore, the number of technology staff at JPMorgan - or technologists, as they are known at the bank - has grown almost 40 per cent since 2013, with Singapore having gone through a \"growth cycle\" last year in terms of tech hiring, said Ms Beer.</p><p>The current tech headcount in Singapore is about 1,200 staff, with the team in Singapore forming a key part of developing the bank's cloud strategy and helping drive adoption globally. The Singapore team has worked on applications used by traders in the service called Symphony - a chat tool backed by top Wall Street banks including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs that is meant to compete with that from Bloomberg.</p><p>Singapore also remains one of the 14 strategic hubs globally for the bank, with some round-the-clock functions anchored in Singapore. Global banks offer \"follow-the-sun\" support to large clients that have multiple operations in different timezones, as they require services such as 24-hour cashflow management.</p><p>There remain broader challenges about technology ahead, with questions still remaining over how machines are being used to process data that may have bias in them, and the impact of that on society.</p><p>Meanwhile, while much has been said about the long-term value of blockchain, it remains \"an evolving landscape\", as Ms Beer noted.</p><p>Still, some costs are on corporates' side in the area of innovation. Ms Beer noted that the falling cost of computing has helped to spur greater adoption of innovation such as machine learning among corporates today.</p><p>\"AI existed before I was born,\" she quipped. \"It's just coming of age.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"We have about 100 fintech emerging tech pilots at any given time that we're executing, or partnering on,\" says Ms Beer.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-211155</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5ST8-JXD1-DYX4-046K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"664\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 16, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

The 'owners' of the fund appear to not be owners at all, but members of its board of directors, all of whom have ties to JPMorgan. And 48 executives of the investment fund are actually paid employees of JPMorgan, which is lending out their services.The fund, known as the Infrastructure Investments Fund, or IIF, contends that it is merely 'advised' by JPMorgan. 'It's no secret that there's a relationship there,' says Tyson Slocum of Public Citizen, who has tracked the sale. </p><p>'But I've been looking at electric utility mergers for 20 years, and I have never seen anything as convoluted as this.'It's not even necessarily illegal for a bank to purchase an electric utility, though some believe it should be. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 was intended to separate banking and commerce, but decades of Federal Reserve interpretations broke down that wall, allowing banks to justify their ownership of nonfinancial businesses as part of 'merchant banking' activities.An ownership stake in physical commodities, including metals mining, oil and gas drilling, and electricity generation, gives banks tremendous information advantages that can be used to trade for profit. 'If we have three big banks controlling the energy sector, and three big tech companies controlling everything else, then what kind of world are we living in?' asks Saule Omarova, a professor at Cornell Law School who specializes in analyzing linkages[1] between banking and the commercial economy.At issue in this case is El Paso Electric[2], a franchise utility inaugurated in 1901, serving 429,000 customers in the city of El Paso and other parts of Texas and New Mexico. The investor-owned utility has been traded on the New York Stock Exchange[3] for 72 years. In June, El Paso Electric agreed to be taken private in a $4.3 billion deal[4] with IIF. It would continue as an independent system operator, with the same staff.To win the approval of the El Paso City Council, IIF put in sweeteners, including $21 million in credits on ratepayer electric bills (which amounts to only $1.36 per month on people's bills, for three years), charitable contributions, and funds for a local economic-development fund. Though at least one former Texas Public Utility Commission member believes[5] that IIF is still extracting too much profit without enough givebacks, the city council, one of several government entities that needed to approve the merger, seemed poised to rubber-stamp it.At the time, IIF was described in the press as 'JPMorgan's Infrastructure Investment Fund,' though the El Paso Electric press release[6] called it 'an Investment Vehicle Advised by JPMorgan Investment Management.' The $11.3 billion fund has interests in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. El Paso Electric would be its first U.S. electric utility, but it holds 11 other energy and electric-generation companies in its portfolio. It operates like a private equity fund; investors can buy into it and earn dividends and awards as the portfolio companies rise in value. Most of IIF's investors are retirement funds.Slocum, of Public Citizen, was immediately skeptical of the merger. For one, in the application to authorize the merger with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), IIF listed three 'owners' of the fund but never actually named them. A footnote to that application stated that the names were disclosed in a 'confidential attachment' in a separate filing to FERC from nine months earlier. 'Public Citizen lacks access to time travel necessary to intervene and request the contents of a confidential attachment filed 270 days before,' Slocum's organization wrote in an objection[7] to the failure to disclose.Lawyers for El Paso Electric and IIF filed a dismissive response. 'They were like, 'Go F yourself,'' Slocum says. However, the response offhandedly noted that the owners were named in a separate application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in conjunction with a different purchase. It turned out that document wasn't public either, but the response did name the owners as Rita J. Sallis, Christopher Ward, and Dennis Clarke. Sallis formerly ran New York City's public pension fund[8], the type of investor client that IIF caters to.But the disclosure raised additional questions. In numerous[9] documents[10] filed[11] with the[12] Securities and Exchange Commission[13], Sallis, Ward, and Clarke are described as 'directors' and 'managers' of different entities of IIF. They are also all affiliated with JPMorgan Investment Management, a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase. 'That seems to indicate that they're no more than a board of directors,' Slocum says.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission application, eventually obtained by Slocum, also includes evidence that these are just directors, not owners. The application states that Clarke intends to 'resign' as an owner at the end of the year, with the others conducting a search for a replacement. 'Owners do not typically resign, and remaining owners do not typically seek a replacement candidate,' Public Citizen wrote in an October 7 filing with FERC.An owner would have exclusive control of the fund, while a board of directors would leave the question of who actually owns IIF open. And if the 'owners' are all affiliated with JPMorgan Chase, it's reasonable to assume that IIF is merely an affiliate. For its part, IIF states on its FERC application that JPMorgan is not an affiliate or parent or merger subsidiary, and not party to the deal.Slocum then found a 2019 PowerPoint presentation IIF made to various cities it was looking to persuade to invest in pension funds. While the presentation insists that JPMorgan Investment Management 'does not own or control' IIF, it states that 'material decisions are made by IIF's independent board of directors in light of recommendations' made by JPMorgan (emphasis mine). The board's existence was never disclosed to FERC; IIF only talked about 'owners.'Furthermore, the PowerPoint notes that a team of 48 individuals provides fundraising, asset management, and acquisition services to IIF (which is practically everything IIF does), and that this team is 'within JPMorgan Investment management solely dedicated to IIF.' That entire team is listed on page 6 of this public presentation[14] IIF made to the city of Fresno, California. One of the team members, Managing Director Landy Gilbert, is named as IIF's managing director[15] in news stories. JPMorgan directors have also spoken on behalf of IIF[16] in public hearings. As Slocum puts it, 'JPMorgan literally staffs IIF.'Slocum believes IIF is trying to have it both ways, while hiding the depth of the JPMorgan relationship from FERC. 'IIF bends over backwards to say we have the best of both worlds, we can access great services by JPMorgan, but we're free and independent of them,' he says. 'JPMorgan is making management recommendations, with some sort of contractual relationship. But hey, independent board, so it's all kosher.'When I described this relationship to Cornell Law professor Saule Omarova, she responded that 'it's sort of straight out of the playbook all these big financial holding companies have been using to acquire commercial businesses.' She added that the financial disclosures are often not granular enough to make out what a bank holding company actually owns or controls, and where there's merely an advisory relationship. 'They're trying to comply on the face with all the regulations, but in reality all it does is create many layers of BS on top of the same business,' Omarova says.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, big banks like JPMorgan can set up or sponsor private equity-style funds, as long as they limit their equity stake in them to no more than 3 percent. But Slocum brings up another factor. In 2013, JPMorgan paid a record $410 million settlement[17] with FERC, over a bank subsidiary charging electricity grids in California and the Midwest 'as much as 80 times the prevailing power prices at certain hours of the day.' The market manipulation yielded $125 million in 'unjust profits.'According to Slocum, 'The understanding in 2013 was that FERC said we're going to go easy on you in exchange for you guys getting out of the physical energy business.' So the obfuscation may be a function of JPMorgan trying to honor that handshake agreement while still buying back into the electricity market.Scooping up El Paso Electric would be lucrative for JPMorgan. Not only are there 429,000 captive customers delivering steady cash flow, but the service territory includes the Permian basin, one of the largest fields for fracking in America. 'Fracking is power hungry,' Slocum says. 'You're hooking up a jet engine to force chemicals and water into that shale formation. El Paso Electric is in a good geographic position to become a pure utility for the Permian.'Slocum wants FERC to hold an evidentiary hearing to get answers on the corporate structure of IIF, the 'ownership' stakes, and any affiliate, financial, and contractual relationships with JPMorgan.Shareholders overwhelmingly approved[18] the El Paso Electric sale in September; regulators in Texas and New Mexico still must sign off, as well as FERC. JPMorgan Chase and IIF did not return requests for comment. The New Mexico attorney general's office, which also has jurisdiction over the deal as a consumer advocate, responded that they were looking into the matter.The Prospect also asked Beto O'Rourke, the presidential candidate and El Paso native, if he had a comment about his hometown electric utility entering into a deal with a large Wall Street bank. O'Rourke's campaign declined to comment.Banks with stakes in commercial businesses increase concentrations of economic power. So do tech companies that are now moving into financial services[19], These corporations effectively build conglomerates with the power to affect market dynamics. For example, if JPMorgan knows that El Paso Electric, or its suite of electricity generation companies, will be surging or shutting down power to the grid, they can use that information in trading in energy markets. On a larger scale, integrated banking and commerce giants can intimidate suppliers, abuse customers, and use their political power to obtain favorable rules.'The business and commerce separation, this principle has been ignored and mocked over the years,' Omarova says. 'But the question of who owns El Paso Electric is actually not so little. It's one example in a big game, and we don't know where it leads.'

Pinto also mentioned the changes in the trading business and the impact of environmental, social and governance investment strategies. \"It's possible that some companies will really struggle to finance themselves, their cost of capital will go to the sky and they may not exist going forward,\" he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a time when banks around the world are increasingly cutting jobs to save costs, Morgan Stanley is the latest firm to make a year-end efficiency push, cutting about 1,500 jobs, Bloomberg News reports, citing people familiar with the matter. CEO James Gorman said the cuts would account for about 2% of the bank's staff. Across the global banking sector, the layoffs represent the biggest workforce reduction since 2015, according to filings by companies and labor unions, the report added.</p><p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.'s new CEO Charlie Scharf has closely scrutinized the bank's operations since he took over in October, which has led to distress among employees over potential changes, American Banker reports, citing people who asked not to be identified. The prospective changes are related to the firm's strategy, relations with regulators and shuffling executives, among other matters.</p><p>The transition from the London interbank offered rate to the secured overnight financing rate is expected to pick up the pace in 2020, with regulators putting more pressure on companies to make the switch ahead of the 2021 year-end deadline, American Banker reports. \"And if you think about how much needs to be done, two years is not a lot of time,\" Lary Stromfeld, a partner with Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft, told the publication.</p><p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan have adopted ways to keep trading in the $1.2 trillion U.S. repo market while minimizing capital requirements at the end of the year and limiting regulatory controls, the Financial Times reports, citing people familiar with the banks' strategy. Goldman has initiated using derivatives known as total return swaps that carry lower capital requirements than regular repo trades, while JPMorgan has encouraged the use of so-called \"sponsored repo\" deals. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment to the news outlet.</p><p>In other parts of the world</p><p>Asia-Pacific: China revises securities law; 10 Japanese banks under regulator's watch</p><p>Europe: Italy gets more time to plan MPS stake sale; new Danske lawsuit; RBI wins appeal</p><p>Middle East &amp; Africa: Qatar moves to bolster law against dirty money; Tunisia holds rate</p><p>Now featured on S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence</p><p>Fed looks to keep rates steady in 2020, but downside risks remain: The Federal Reserve has signaled it aims to keep interest rates steady in 2020, but lingering downside risks to the economy and below-target inflation figures could force it to ease policy again.</p><p>The day ahead</p><p>Early morning futures indicators pointed to a higher opening for the U.S. market.</p><p>In Asia, the Hang Seng rose 0.33% to 28,319.39, while the Nikkei 225 declined 0.76% to 23,656.62.</p><p>In Europe, around midday, the FTSE 100 was down 0.39% to 7,615.18, and the Euronext 100 was down 0.25% to 1,153.68.</p><p>On the macro front</p><p>The international trade in goods report, the retail inventories report, the wholesale inventories report, the pending home sales index and the Dallas Fed Manufacturing Survey are due out today.</p><p>Click here to read about today's financial markets, setting out the factors driving stocks, bonds and currencies around the world ahead of the New York open.</p><p>The Daily Dose has an editorial deadline of 7:30 a.m. ET.

At least 400 people killed and many nor feared dead as the series of strong earthquakes strike Western China. Ten Thousand more are injured according to \"State T.V.\" that's reporting many remained buried under ruble. The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other strong after shocks. Charles McCord will have more on this story later in the show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we're going to turn to your Fox Business Minute. And some of your top business stories of the day, JP Morganwill give Wall Street an initial read on the big banks when it reports its first quarter numbers this morning, at 7:00 eastern time. The company is expected to post a profit of $2.9 billion or 64 cents a share. We're going to have that report for you live as it breaks here on Fox Business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overseas markets rising on a positive report from Intel. That company kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big way. Shares jumping as much as 4% after profit in the quarter nearly quadrupled. Intel says it got a lift from sales of new chips for computer servers. That's the type of purchases companies had been holding off on during the recession.</p><p>And, Toyota will stop selling its 2010 Lexus GX 460 after \"Consumer Reports\" says people shouldn't buy it. The company asking dealers to pull the SUV until it can do its own test. The magazine says the SUV has an unusually high risk of rolling over. This problem reportedly has to do with the electronic stability control, not the brakes or the gas pedals. They were part of that massive recall for Toyota. Toyota shares traded lower in yesterday's session state side.</p><p>Here's a quick look at our European markets as we head into Wednesday's session. Again, picking up of that positive news from Intel and trading in positive territory. Our U.S. stock futures doing something similar this morning also with some green arrows on the screen. We'll show you those. Right now, S&amp;P 500 up 2/10 of a percent. \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" next for you here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, FBN HOST: You know what's making me sick?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: What?</p><p>IMUS: Green tea -- making me ill, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm sorry about that. I just --</p><p>IMUS: So, my wife says to me -- I love her to death, believe me -- but she says, well this new stuff that she is giving me that kills -- they all kills cancer cells -- so far so good, you know, beats radiation or a stupid operation.</p><p>CHALES MCCORD, FBN NEWSCASTER: OK. Go on, make this a point.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: OK. But she says this new stuff she's giving me, she said it's detoxing your body.</p><p>MCCORD: Very well.</p><p>IMUS: And I'm thinking what is left to detox?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, what's left?</p><p>MCCORD: I know --</p><p>IMUS: You know what I had for dinner? An f-ing radish!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No wonder you're a grumpy man!</p><p>IMUS: I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No wonder you're crank tan.</p><p>IMUS: I had a radish!</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Oh, I'm full, thanks!</p><p>MCCORD: You look like an end of season corn husk. You've got to stop.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING.\"</p><p>IMUS: all right, five minutes after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the radio around the country and on the Fox Business Network. Pretty good line-up this morning. we'll start with Geraldo Rivera. He's coming up. We'll check in his five favorite songs, Charles. They are \"Me And Bobby Mcgee,\" Janice Joplin. \"Love Me Tender,\" Elvis. They sang all the Elvis songs last night on \"American Idol,\" which was a mistake for most of them. \"Girl From The North Country,\" Bob Dylan. \"Dance With My Father,\" Luther Vandross, and the Bruce Springsteen song, \"Streets of Philadelphia.\"</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And then David Kirby is coming up. David Kirby is the author of \"Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial Pig, Dairy, and Poultry Farms to Humans and The Environment. He's selling one book a day on Amazon.</p><p>MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p>IMUS: He can't get on any -- he can't get on Fox and Fiends. He can't get on \"The Today Show.\" He can't get on anything. And, do you know why he can't?</p><p>MCCORD: I suspect why --</p><p>IMUS: Because nobody wants to talk about it. I was trying -- and I don't want to talk about it. I was talking to Lupica last night, and he starts going (INAUDIBLE). He wouldn't let me tell him about these factory farms. You know, there's -- nobody is railing against people -- I'm not at least, people who eat meat or poultry. I don't care what you eat.</p><p>MCCORD: Not at all!</p><p>IMUS: We raise cattle in New Mexico. My friends are cattle ranchers. That's not the point, but the way these animals are - well, you can't even -- like there's a site -- what is this site, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: There's a site called Farm Sanctuary, which is it's an outfit that does rescues although it's a pittance because of the massive dimensions of the problem, but they do some rescues of some of these animals that are factory, you know, factory processed before they process them, and the web site is -- shows both the farm sanctuary side and also the concentrated animal feeding operations side.</p><p>IMUS: Don't want to see it.</p><p>MCCORD: And --</p><p>IMUS: And people in the morning are trying to have their bacon and eggs --</p><p>MCCORD: Of course!</p><p>IMUS: -- and sausage with egg and muffin and all that. You don't want to hear about it, so I don't blame you.</p><p>MCCORD: Particularly, if you look at the egg production process.</p><p>IMUS: Believe me, you just do not want to know, but I like Kirby, and it's an important - you ought to read it. You ought to know about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, you really should. You really should.</p><p>IMUS: And, you know, there's a way to buy organic meat and to buy -- well, sort of.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And there's a way to -- well, there is and to eat animals, but animals are like us. They have -- I mean I've spent half \\my life with horses. I mean they -- and cattle. They have emotions. They --</p><p>MCCORD: They are just as complicated physical systems as we do.</p><p>IMUS: They feel pain.</p><p>MCCORD: They certainly do.</p><p>IMUS: They -- well, they are not a bunch of happy animals skipping around old McDonald's farm going in and out of the red barn. Did you know that, Jenna?</p><p>LEE: Well, now I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: Is ain't an oink, oink here and a cluck, cluck there.</p><p>IMUS: No. Not a happy little pig oiking in the thing</p><p>MCCORD: Here a cluck, there a cluck, everywhere.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCCORD: Fuzzy-wuzzy was a bear.</p><p>IMUS: That's what you have to look forward to in about an hour.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's something that you should know about.</p><p>IMUS: He's the guy who wrote \"Evidence of Harm,\" you know.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You don't want to talk about that, either.</p><p>MCCORD: No, of course not]</p><p>IMUS: But, so -- including, by the way, me. But I will, because --</p><p>MCCORD: Animal lover.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know why I'm willing to do it, I just am. And then Tom Friedman is coming up. A good column he has in the paper this morning about Op-Ed page of the \"New York Times\" about Iraq and Afghanistan. How he -- did you read it, Bernie?</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: I read some of it. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: It's pretty good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn good.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it is --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll take a look at it.</p><p>IMUS: -- heretofore whenever we get involved with one of these countries, we didn't care exactly what they did in the country and the cold war as long as they lined up with us. If we support some a despot, well that was just --.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it was, yes.</p><p>IMUS: But, now we're more idealistic, and we want to change the culture of these countries.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: We want the people to be -- I mean it's just so insane.</p><p>MCCORD: Hearts and minds.</p><p>IMUS: You can't -- it's -- even Friedman this morning admits that it's stupid. So, all of that stuff is coming up. Charles, what's the big news?</p><p>MCCORD: The big news story is another bad earthquake in the headlines, I-man. This one in province in province in Western China, and the death toll has risen -- the known death toll to at least 400 now.</p><p>And there's a good news story out of Florida with the successful recovery of this 11-year-old girl who has missing in swamps for some four days.</p><p>And the president of the United States saying the world is a more secure place now, post-nuclear summit that they did actually achieve some things there.</p><p>IMUS: We're having a guy on Friday, just one of full of surprise for his book \"The Dead End.\"</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: About the arms race trade in the United States and Russia. David Hoffman is his name. A spotlight on this whole, you know, what's really going on with this whole nuc thing</p><p>MCCORD: Clarity to that --</p><p>IMUS: Well, more interesting than talking about torturing little pigs and stuff. Jenna you don't seem that happy to see any of us this morning.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEE: I'm thrilled to see you. How can you say such a thing?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. You just came in and well, here's a thing with Jenna, so -- we love her to death, by the way.</p><p>LEE: Here's the thing with Jenna. Yes?</p><p>IMUS: Is that we love her to death. What's going on in business?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: There you're done.</p><p>LEE: Very good.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. It's like, Wyatt says to me -- he's 11. He just says, \"You have to know when to shut up. Just shut up.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Wise beyond his years!</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Just be quiet. So, in business news, Jenna?</p><p>LEE: He seems to know more about women than --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes he does.</p><p>LEE: -- some other people in the room.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>LEE: Well, the markets are trading higher this morning. We had a big tech company last night. Intel out with good numbers, and that helped the market. We're also going to get numbers from JP Morgan, a major investment bank today, or I should say, just bank in general. We're going to get those numbers in about 45 minutes and will mean a lot to the markets.</p><p>In the meantime, AIG is trying to pay us back, still they are selling 53 of their planes to a major Australian investment bank for about $2 billion, so that's going to come back to us and for all the private plane users in the room. This is for you, specifically. ABERCROMBIE &amp; Fitch is paying their CEO not to use the private jet. And if he goes over a certain amount, he's going to have to pay. So, they're paying him $4 million, just in case he goes over the amounts and then he has to pay back the company.</p><p>IMUS: Certainly that's not directed at me, I can't imagine that.</p><p>MCCORD: No, it's the rest of us private jet users!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I just don't understand why we're bringing the hurt to the I- man. I just don't get that. Speaking of bringing of hurts to the I-man, Ronnie Deutsche --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I love this.</p><p>IMUS: -- who is this tax babe. She -- I don't know. I was just talking about her yesterday. This image I have of her at the end of the bar at 9:00 at night -- every night at the Blarney Stone with a pell-mell dangling out of the corner of her mouth, hunched over a glass of Jack Daniels, you know, who's going to be next.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Shot and a beer chaser!</p><p>IMUS: Exactly.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: She says, \"Dear Imus, I am a cigar smoking woman, so I thought you might enjoy my favorite cigar\" -- and always a great thing to give a cancer patient --</p><p>MCCORD: Perfect!</p><p>IMUS: Somebody with emphysema. Anyway, enjoy -- this woman is so dumb. It makes my -- actually it makes my toenails hurt. \"Enjoy and happy tax season.\"</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Ronnie, what you can do with this --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, no, no, no.</p><p>IMUS: Well, she's not dumb, and she's a nice lady, and here's the cigar.</p><p>MCCORD: That's no good.</p><p>IMUS: Nub using our Jackson. Actually, do you smoke cigars?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't? How about nub?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do!</p><p>IMUS: You can have this one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Anyway, Warner got sports. He's coming up. Jim Nantz all over Tiger Woods, huh, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, FBN SPORTSCASTER: Oh, man, what happened?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean just --</p><p>WOLF: Hey dawg!</p><p>IMUS: Well, you know, Warner. Somebody asked me, \"why is Warner calling you dawg.\" I said, \"Oh about a week ago, I said something, I referred to him as dawg, what's going on.\" And so now, Warner is doing that.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: But he does it and nobody knows why.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Well, I thought you were talking to Rob.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, Rob is great for doing that. I'll make just some offhand comment.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sometimes even off the air, and Rob will write a bit about it, assuming that everybody knows what we're talking about and of course, nobody does. At any rate, -- well, Nantz is saying that if he would used the kind of language Tiger Woods used that had got on CBS mics as Tiger Woods did. He'll be fired, and he's right about that.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And, two, as others have said, Lupica and you, Warner Wolf, and Nantz, and that is the Tiger is going to use -- the Tiger says he's going to try to do better than do better.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: If you're going to behave better, then behave better, which he did not do, and as Nantz pointed out, if somebody offered him and said, well, tiger had a camera in his face all day. Nantz say \"well, so did Phil Mickelson.\"</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Phil didn't say anything.</p><p>WOLF: No!</p><p>IMUS: All Phil did was win.</p><p>WOLF: That's it!</p><p>IMUS: Which Tiger didn't do.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he's right!</p><p>WOLF: Nantz is absolutely right, and Tiger is the one that brought it up.</p><p>IMUS: And the Yankees won the home opener.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, they did. Biggest crowd ever in the new stadium for a regular season game.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>WOLF: And there's a couple of good stories. Bulls General Manager, John Paxon, apparently challenged Bulls' coach Vinnie Delnegro to a fight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO: That great!</p><p>IMUS: What happened?</p><p>WOLF: Well, we'll see what happens there, and the Bulls are investigating. Well, that looks like the story. Ben Roethlisberger met with NFL commissioner Goodell yesterday and faces possible suspension and Beef Jerky has dropped their sponsorship for Big Ben's Beef Jerky giving our beef a bad name. And, Barry Bonds -- Barry bonds says, \"I'm proud of Mark McGwire for admitting he used steroids.\" Barry Bonds.</p><p>IMUS: And Bernie has a briefing sponsored by P.C. Richard and Son. What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, first of all. President Obama is going to go to Poland this weekend for the president's funeral, there. The polish president died in the air crash, which is a nice thing. He said a lot of things about President Obama, give up a weekend. It's actually a nice gesture.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And Conan O'Brien going to TBS. He's pushing back George Lopez, and there's a lot of talk about Lopez getting disked and getting the ironically the Conan treatment from TBS. Anyway, he had Chris Rock on the show last night, and they were discussing just that.</p><p>CHRIS ROCK, ARTIST (?): Where are you going?</p><p>CONAN O'BRIEN, TBS HOST (?): I'm going to midnight. He's coming on 11:00, and I'm going to midnight.</p><p>ROCK: Get the hell out of here!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK: So, you're going to move for the white man! -</p><p>O'BRIEN: I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK: I hope he appreciate this.</p><p>O'BRIEN: I think the white man does appreciate it very much.</p><p>ROCK: OK. You go got to clean the park or nothing.</p><p>O'BRIEN: No, I got to go to work an hour later.</p><p>ROCK: OK.</p><p>O'BRIEN: A dream come true.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I'm just glad Jimmie Norton didn't make those jokes but like the politically incorrect humor.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. That was good, funny.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's from last night.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen -- wheels just came off right there, didn't they, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: A little bit.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Give you time to get your bacon and sausage going and all that and then we'll fire up \"Animal Factory\" and David Kirby in about an hour. However, next is Geraldo Rivera. This is one of his favorite songs, one of mine, too.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Are you looking for an investment opportunity, but you're not sure where to start? Why not get involved with what \"Ink Magazine\" has named one of the fastest growing companies in America, \"Planet Fitness.\" \"Planet Fitness\" is a gym that attracts the average Joes, Charles.

Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's you're Fox Business Minute on this Wednesday morning. President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today to talk about financial regulation reform. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner saying, quote \"republicans won't want to be on this wrong side of this.\" But, Mitch McConnell saying the democrats won't solve any problems and will provide endless protection for banks.</p><p>Big banks fighting against tough derivatives rules. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley telling the senate agricultural committee. Stricter rules will limit profits. The committee chairman Blanche Lincoln is expected to propose a more aggressive approach to sweeping changes to the derivatives market.</p><p>And, Fed Chief Ben Bernanke testifying on the Hill today to offer his outlook for the economy. Lawmakers on the joint economic committee will likely question him about the strength of the recovery and also the pace of job growth. Fed officials have pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for an extended period to boost spending. Wall Street waiting to hear if the Fed will move away from that commitments.</p><p>All right, let's take a quick look at our futures here on a Wednesday morning in positive -- well, positive territory ahead of JP Morgan's numbers. We expect those in a little more than half an hour. Over to Charles now for this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And a couple of these stories that we're following this morning, Jenna. There's another bad earthquake in the headlines. The number of dead and injured from a strong earthquake Western China is climbing.</p><p>Chinese State Television saying at least 400 people had been killed, more than 10,000 injured. Rescue workers trying to dig trapped people out of the rubble of collapsed mud and wood houses. Scores of people gathering out in the open areas searching for relatives, a scene we have seen too much certainly of late.</p><p>Tea party movement having a homecoming of sports today. Sarah Palin scheduled to headline a rally in Boston. The city from which tea party supporters revolutionary spirit was born. They figured it will be like 10,000 people or so to turn out.</p><p>Couple of the headlines as the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program continues for you, right now, here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-four after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. Geraldo Rivera is coming up in just a couple of minutes here.</p><p>And the David Kirby and his book, \"Animal Factory.\" Charles and I were talking about last night and we're talking about it this morning, and I don't know what the solution is. But it's certainly is worth discussing. You know, but -- you know, people like John Stewart, you know I like.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And David Colbert -- or Steven Colbert and some of these other shows that this would be a natural for -- Stewart is much as I like him. He won't beat up on anybody. He won't talk about anything, unless it's safe. I mean beating up Fox Newsor whatever it is or Glenn Beck, that's a safe target for him.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: So -- but, putting somebody on or Colbert putting -- putting David Kirby on with \"Animal Factory\" is not safe for them, and they don't have -- I don't want to be too harsh here. They won't do it. They just don't have the guts. They're fighting and they don't want to know about it, and they don't want somebody in a suit to tell them they can't do it.</p><p>MCCORD: It is certainly worth the conversation, the subject.</p><p>IMUS: But, people think well, then, you know, people like David Kirby are screaming at you that you can't eat meat, but he's not saying that.</p><p>MCCORD: That is not -- at all.</p><p>IMUS: But there's certainly is far more humane way to go about this and it will cost more.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But, the amount of money saves in health care costs would be so astronomical that it would be ridiculous, but that doesn't help the people processing the meat and the poultry because they don't -- they costs them more.</p><p>MCCORD: And as you said last night, it doesn't have to be done overnight, but you can take a baby step here and there.</p><p>IMUS: It's already tedious, and we've only talked about it for a minute ago.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No not at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Well, we want to --</p><p>IMUS: Bernie already wants to kill him.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's me point. Here's Warner with sports. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man. Baseball, 49,000, Yankees Home Opener including George Steinbrenner. Yankees almost blew a 5 up and lead held on beat the Angels, 7 to 5. They took Andy Pettitte out after 6 with a 5 nothing lead. Jeter and Nick Johnson home run for the Yanks. Here's the call, Michael Kay, Yes Network.</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, RADIO COMMENTATOR: This was a hit to right field. There it goes. See yeah!</p><p>WOLF: The biggest hand, Angels DH and former Yankee Hideki Matsui hugged by his teammates receiving a standing-o, receiving his World Series Ring. However, as a joke, Derek Jeter gave Matsui a fake ring.</p><p>DEREK JETER: We knew he wouldn't be able to compare to it anyone because he was on the other side. So, knowing Matsui, he's probably proud to get the bootleg one too, and then we get him the real one.</p><p>WOLF: And the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2. Guess what, I-man?</p><p>IMUS: What a whacky team, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, crazy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Loose.</p><p>RUFINO: We replaced the ring and give him this one!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not so funny!</p><p>RUFINO: And then we gave him triple glass.</p><p>WOLF: You thought I was going to play the Japanese voice, right, I- man?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you never know.</p><p>WOLF: No. I wouldn't do that to you.</p><p>IMUS: Of course you would!</p><p>WOLF: Me? No! By the way, the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2. The game was over in two hours and 11 minutes. Whoa! Mets lost, 56,000 Dodgers home opener. Dodgers beat the backs, 9 to 5. Manny Steroid Home Run number 547. The first pitch was thrown out by Will I-am of the Black Eyed Peas. And the anthem was sung by Leann Rimes. Ben Roethlisberger after his meeting here in New York with commissioner Goodell said --</p><p>IMUS: Are you drunk, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: You sound drunk.</p><p>RUFINO: What you got there on the console there?</p><p>WOLF: Wait a minute, I though that -- I thought the wine wore off. Wait a minute!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Come on, dawg!</p><p>RUFINO: This dawg is drunk!</p><p>IMUS: Here's a deal. We got a press on, Warner. We're begging you.</p><p>WOLF: Here's a great story. According to eye witnesses, after the Bull-Suns game two weeks ago, Bulls General Manager, John Paxon charged into the office of Bulls Coach Vinnie Delnegro. Grabbed Delnegro by the tie and poked him repeatedly in the chest because of Delnegro's use of joke him Noah. Paxon while being pulled off by the assistant, Bernie Bickerstaff, challenged Delnegro to a fight. However, Delnegro did not retaliate knowing that the Bulls could void his contract. Here is Delnegro.</p><p>VINNIE DELNEGRO, BULLS' COAH: No comment on that. Whatever happens is between the organization, myself, and the people involved, you know, that is our internal stuff.</p><p>WOLF: Aha! So, the Bulls have hired lawyers to get more interviews and see what happens.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-nine after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Time for the Fox Business Networkbusiness report and here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: So, I was talking to a friend of mine last night, and this friend of min is Lupica. He said, \"Dagen thinks that she's normal, though she is interesting different. I said, yes. And you do, don't you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not normal?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why not?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, why not? Everybody gets their freak on in some way, it's everybody else who thinks they are normal, you know? I think I'm normal. Everybody has issues.</p><p>IMUS: No, don't you think, Charles she's normal.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: I think she is, one of the more normal people that I have ever met.</p><p>IMUS: She is?</p><p>MCCORD: She just has a couple of issues, she's more willing to discuss them maybe, than the average person.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>MCCORD: That's all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People don't south don't try and hide the crazy folks in their family. They trot them out. That is a good time.</p><p>IMUS: What they've done in your case, which is fine with us.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: They date them.</p><p>IMUS: They marry them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's shockingly enough I edit myself, pretty heavily.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's disturbing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's like getting in the shoving matches with people on the train, I mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I didn't know -- I didn't touch anybody. I got in his face with my finger because he cursed at me.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know?</p><p>MCCORD: He can't be doing that.</p><p>(ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, do not -- no no, no, no, no. I got a whole treasure trove...</p><p>IMUS: I brought my nuts to work here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank goodness and have mercy on this planet that you got some food.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We were starting to wonder.</p><p>IMUS: You are such an idiot.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: See they're in a bag.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right. That is refreshing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to start frisking you every morning to make sure you've got some food.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They look like even they were stomped on a bunch.</p><p>IMUS: This is a week's supply, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, it's a week supply, that's not for just a day to have with a Martini? Come on.</p><p>IMUS: And Dagen for the business news, Geraldo is standing by here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Quickly, if a story has anything to do with money, let's call it a business story. On that note, Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer spent $100,000 on call girls. Over a roughly two year period, this is according to Peter Elkin's upcoming book, \"Rough Justice.\" This is on page six of \"The New York Post\" today about 20 appointments, with ten escorts over at least two years, by my Math, that is about $5,000 a pop. One escort told Peter Elkin, it was very business like, he was not one of those people who I would have said, went out of their way to make me feel lovely and nice like many did.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And you're a hooker. What the hell.</p><p>IMUS: That is why he's paying you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, calm down...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, if you are getting paid, that is all you get.</p><p>IMUS: We are not going over to trumps to buy a bunch of stuff! It's 32 after the hour here on the IMUS IN the morning program. Dagen McDowell with the fox Business Networkbusiness report. She'll be back, of course, and so will Jenna. It's one of Geraldo's favorite songs, we're way late for him but we're playing his song, so, what's he care?</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>Announcer: Warning, some content may be unsuitable for mature audiences. IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX NEWSANCHOR: A business alert for you now. Opec slightly raising its 2010 World Oil demand growth forecast to 900,000 barrels per day. The previous forecast for 880,000 barrel rise, opec says, it sees oil trading around 70, maybe $80 a barrel in coming months supported by the economy, and a comfortable fundamental outlook. We'll keep an eye on oil this morning.</p><p>Let's get to your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Now, jp Morganwill give Wall Street an initial read on the big banks, when its first to report first quarter earnings this morning, the company is expected to post a profit of $2.9 billion or 64 cents a share.

And I guarantee they are talking about what time kfc opens and they can get a double down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I tell them what you just said? Yo, are you talking about where you will get lunch, like kfc, because again, if you don't want the abuse, don't stand behind the camera, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn right.</p><p>IMUS: Well, whatever, we wonder what they are doing, so. They are not paying attention to you, that is for sure, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. They are trying to ignore me, probably because I'm liable to lock horns with them and just cause a big uproar in the middle of the newsroom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: All right. I'm eating a nut. Well, the -- where's Geraldo?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He is off the radar right now.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Apparently his plane has not landed from Afghanistan, just yet. He was supposed to have landed already, but some sort of delay.</p><p>IMUS: Is he coming back this morning or are you just jerking my chain?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, no. I just spoke to the one and only Mrs. Rivera and she was expecting -- he should have been walking through.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's fine. OK. The Addams -- man, I keep on coughing and everything else. The Addams family open on Broadway last Thursday. And, Jerry Zack is directing it but he was brought in, it was in Chicago, and they brought him to New York and it needed to be fixed and so they brought him and they fix it and they fixed it a little. But here's the Ben Brantley, here's the opening paragraph of the review from last Thursday, Charles.</p><p>\"Imagine if you dare the agonies of the talented people trapped inside the collapsing tomb called the Addams family. Being in this genuinely ghastly musical, which opened Thursday night, at the Lunt-fontanne Theater, and stars a shame fully squandered at Nathan lane and Bebe Neuwirth must feel like going to a Halloween party in a straight jacket or a suit of armor. Sure you make a flashy, if obvious first impression, but then you are stuck in the darned thing for the rest of the night and it is really, really uncomfortable. You can barely move, and a strangled voice inside you keeps gasping, help! Get me out of here!\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: And not what the, not what the Addams family folks were looking for, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: The next -- last weekend they sold a million dollars worth of tickets, you can't get a ticket, to it until the fall.</p><p>MCCORD: Wow!</p><p>IMUS: So, it had a huge advance and the universally awful review.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a rough opening paragraph.</p><p>IMUS: Particularly from the times, the one that matters, you know?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, it hasn't apparently hurt them. I received an e-mail, from the doctor wanting to know if I wanted to come and see it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: But I want to see million dollar quartet and American idiot, before I see, OK. I mean, I was going to Broadway season, it's going to be -- it's going to be one musical after another.</p><p>RUFINO: Mr. First Nighter.</p><p>IMUS: One or two would be about it, you know, so.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: I saw one last Sunday, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: What did you see Warner?</p><p>WOLF: It's called \"Enron,\" it's about the scandal, obviously.</p><p>IMUS: No kidding!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: No, you know, it was over. When the scandal -- I could never understand what actually happened, but in the play, oh, you see what they actually did. Just, gosh stole the money on nothing and they sold the stock and had nothing.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: It was pretty good. I thought it was interesting.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, selling stock based on nothing was pretty good or the musical, or it was the musical or just the play?</p><p>WOLF: No, although they.</p><p>IMUS: Is it the musical or play?</p><p>WOLF: It's a play.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it's a play.</p><p>WOLF: But they do have music in it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, OK, that's a life that you have -- we need an intervention. I mean, if you have to go see a play based on the \"Enron Scandal,' really, you need some help!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: And a musical, that's kind of idiotic, why not sing songs about it?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Here comes Enron.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Dice Clay.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS DICE CLAY: We have Dice Clay.</p><p>IMUS: What is Dice have?</p><p>BARTLETT: Dice says, the top eight most surprising revelations in Kitty Kelly's Oprah book.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why don't we do them?</p><p>BARTLETT: All right, then, I'm over here now, you know. Number eight: Stairs guys and dishes, she don't do any of them, oh!</p><p>IMUS: What is this again now?</p><p>BARTLETT: The top eight most surprising revelations in Kitty Kelly's Oprah book.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>BARTLETT: Number 8: Stairs, guys and dishes, she don't do any of them. Number seven: Her low self-esteem is responsible for her weight gains and her relationship with John Tesh, oh! Number six: The lavish gifts she sent to Diane Sawyer were just the ruse to get close to that tasty albino hunk Mike Nichols, oh! Number five: She once shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. Number four: She can belch the alphabet all the way to the letter q. Number three: She tried to sue the Grand Ole Opry for copy write infringement. Number two: She keeps Steadman around only because Michael Jackson already bought the elephant man's bones, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee. And then number one most surprising revelation in Kitty Kelly's Oprah book, she paid $50,000 to the u.s. government to her ass declared a national monument, oh!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Dice Clay here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. It is 16 until the hour, this is what you get when the guest doesn't show up. This portion of the imus in the morning program is sponsored by fair way market. You two are particularly going to be interested in animal factory before you go and get your double down at kfc today.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: That is when I stopped eating chicken, when I found out how they processed it. I mean, I don't want to discuss it now.</p><p>MCCORD: Can't, can't discuss it. The details, no.</p><p>IMUS: So, but poor David Kirby, I mean, former \"New York Times\" reporter. He wrote \"Evidence of Harm\" which is a \"New York Times\" best- seller. And he can't sell the Amazon -- Barnes &amp; Noble sells one book a day of \"Animal Factory.\"</p><p>MCGUIRK: I don't get it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you will get it, you want to know how your chicken is processed?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No.</p><p>BARTLETT: I don't eat chicken.</p><p>IMUS: Beef.</p><p>BARTLETT: No. I don't eat beef.</p><p>IMUS: Did you ever eat beef?</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes, at one time.</p><p>IMUS: OK. You don't eat beef or chicken at all?</p><p>BARTLETT: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't eat them, are you a vegetarian now?</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: No, you are not.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes. I am, for the past month.</p><p>IMUS: You have been a vegetarian for the past month.</p><p>BARTLETT: Yes.

You want to know how it is processed?</p><p>POWELL: No.</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't?</p><p>POWELL: No, I don't, you know, I don't even want to know what happens while it goes down -- when I swallow it. I don't want to watch that, either.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>POWELL: I mean, why somebody would want to watch that?</p><p>IMUS: They don't.</p><p>POWELL: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: But aren't you concerned that it is making you and the planet sick?</p><p>POWELL: Oh, I'm concerned about that.</p><p>IMUS: Are you concerned that it tortures the little animals who feel just as you and Rob?</p><p>POWELL: Let me explain something about chickens. A million some-odd years ago, they were dinosaurs, billions of years ago, they were dinosaurs, chickens are descended from dinosaurs, which means, that if we were here with the chickens when they were dinosaurs, they would dinosaurs, they would be eating me. Do you think they'd be concerned about how I felt as they tortured me?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Very good answer.</p><p>RUFINO: And that starts the power.</p><p>IMUS: I can't argue with that.

How does that happen?</p><p>MCCORD: I just think they get to thinking about it.</p><p>IMUS: How did that -- you butt out. How does that happen, Bernard?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Apparently Geraldo, his plane was delayed or something, is the information we had, maybe we could ask Tom.</p><p>IMUS: Why, is it Tom's fault?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, no, no. I mean, we went through the FOX bookers in this case, so.</p><p>TOM `BIGFOOT' BOWMAN, PROGRAM PRODUCER: We normally go through the Media Department here at FOX, so I think, actually what happened was there was some mix-up with the days, and, they got it wrong.</p><p>IMUS: That would be important in booking a guest.</p><p>BOWMAN: Booking the right day, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Would get the day right.</p><p>BOWMAN: The date and the time, I think are two important elements, sort of like headphones and a clock.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Knowing the way FOX runs, I can't believe it was their fault. I mean, the Media Department, I can't believe that they screwed it up.</p><p>BOWMAN: Well, I'm not blaming it on the whole department, but I think there was some confusion on their end.</p><p>IMUS: So, you're throwing the FOX Media Department under the bus.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm not throwing the whole department under the bus.</p><p>IMUS: It sounds to me like you are.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm just saying that there was a mix up with the day...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't want to mix up with some big load sitting in the control room. That is where it was.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm going to come down there and I'm going to whip up on you.</p><p>IMUS: Come on down, bitch, come on down...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOWMAN: Yes.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Larry, how are you?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS LARRY KING: Elizabeth Taylor tweeting yesterday, she's not engaged to her manager, Jason Winters, I guess she doesn't want anyone to think she is off the market. Because, you know, there are some guys who believe that 300 pounds, 78-year-old husband in a wheelchair is a catch. I'm not surprised she's not engaged, I mean, this guy has got no motivation to make it legal. He's what's that old saying, he's milking the cow for free. Besides the age difference is prohibitive. She's almost 30- years-older than him. Her ovaries dried up before he even had a feather on his schmigel (ph), what's in it for him?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh, Jesus!</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I don't know if we need that kind of detail, do you Larry?</p><p>BARTLETT: What's in it for him?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>BARTLETT: Besides the good parking spots, unless she still a goa, I mean, I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating the olive loaf and as long as I got the private duty nurse to push the wheelchair back in forth, it will be a hell of a less work. It wouldn't be the first time I took a safari through her Velcro triangle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Between Larry -- and Michael Jackson. We were on the beach at Santro pay, I was under the humumo (ph) for 45 minutes, nobody noticed a thing, because that was back when she was looking like an Albino, Leon Sphinx, you could have hidden a Volkswagen under there and nobody beginning to wise up. Slick was in Alabama, the Yin Yang twins are a little scrappy, who's got the most pranxious, your thoughts?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Larry King here on the imus in the morning program.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep it right here on the FOX Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments.

That's 10 cents higher than the Wall Street estimate, if those two numbers are comparable to each other.</p><p>The revenue results -- the sales results are also better than expected more than $28 billion, when the Street was looking for $26 billion plus. There is the JP Morganstock price on the screen next to me, at $46.10 a share, up from yesterday's close, of $45.87.</p><p>Among other things, JP Morganled by its CEO Jamie Dimon saying it's continuing to see its delinquencies stabilize and that the economy still faces challenges, as the bank puts it this morning.</p><p>Now, the total profit for the quarter, the net income, was $3.3 billion dollars. So, a $3.3 billion dollar profit for JP Morganand what it still described as a challenging economic environment. But the company does report profit that's better than expected by 10 cents a share -- 74 cents, versus 64 cents.</p><p>It'll certainly be a stock to watch today, it comes on the heels to better than expected results last night from Intel. We'll see if those two put together able to put the stock market on a firm footing this morning.</p><p>Now, we have another piece of breaking news to get to this morning on the housing market, that would be the latest mortgage applications figures and those went down last week, the overall number, the headline figure was down by more than nine percent. One of the things we have been reporting on here at Fox Business in recent weeks have been the rising of mortgage rates.</p><p>So, fewer people applying for mortgages; 9.6 percent drop. Now the mortgage rates, the 30-year-fixed mortgage rate was up last week to around 5.3 percent. It came down in the most recent week, a little bit; so mortgage rates, after spiking up one week, now coming back down this week.</p><p>We are up on the futures, 32 on the DOW futures and more coverage of this breaking news and all of the top headlines of the day straight ahead as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: What's coming up, on \"Varney and Company?\"</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\": Well, you know, Roni Deutsch, the tax lady.</p><p>IMUS: I saw her on with Cavuto. You know what I thought? She will not be doing my taxes, but I'm sure she's fine.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, yesterday --</p><p>IMUS: I have this -- I have this image of Roni, every night around 9:00, she is down at the end of the bar there at the Blarney Stone -- (INAUDIBLE) big old gold glass of Jack Daniels, a Pall Mall hanging out of the corner of her mouth, saying last night I did an Iraqi cab driver, I hope I'll be lucky tonight.</p><p>VARNEY: I like the way she comes on the commercial and says, \"I'm Roni Deutsch\". You know, I like that.</p><p>IMUS: No if she's been around the block. So --</p><p>VARNEY: Well, she's --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Networkall over the world. David Kirby, we've been talking about him all morning and his book, \"Animal Factory\" coming up.</p><p>And Charles -- Charles and I are both stupefied, over a -- thanks -- over a -- the fact that Kirby can't get any traction with his book. That is a -- that's a major publisher.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He wrote a best-seller with \"Evidence of Harm\". His new book is called \"Animal Factory\". Well, because nobody --</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody wants to hear.</p><p>IMUS: Nobody wants to discuss it and I don't blame him. So --</p><p>MCCORD: Give me my Jimmie Dean sausage and forget about it.</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: And so we cancel him or what?</p><p>IMUS: No, we're going to talk it.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: He can't get on anyplace, he can get on here. So you're not going to see him on the \"Today Show\" or \"Good Morning America\" or \"Fox and Fiends\", you just not -- you're not going to see him anywhere because they don't want to talk about it and I don't blame him.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The I-man treads where no host --</p><p>IMUS: No, I just like him and I think the point is, when I found out how they processed chicken I stopped eating it, before I stopped eating all the stuff. I mean, I couldn't do it and now -- and there is a -- there's another way to do it. Nobody is saying don't go to McDonald's, I'm not saying that at all or anything even close to it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: How about Burger King?</p><p>IMUS: Fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: But there's a -- and you can't do it overnight. But, boy there is a far more humane way to raise these animals and, to slaughter them than what they're doing. I mean, it is -- if you knew how what they were doing it is horrific, that you can't -- Charles can't even tell me about it can you.</p><p>MCCORD: No, because I know how you worry you don't want to hear about these things.</p><p>IMUS: Like I can't watch scary movies?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Deirdre and Wyatt watch them and I can't attend to it.</p><p>MCCORD: Understood.</p><p>IMUS: The violence, I can't stand it.</p><p>MCCORD: So I'm not going to tell you about the baby chickens at the grinder. I just don't want to tell you about those kinds of things.</p><p>IMUS: And chickens, the -- I tried to tell Lupica about it last night and he starts screaming on the phone. He said I don't want to hear about it. I said if your kids knew how these animals were treated they wouldn't -- you wouldn't be sitting around the hotel there with a big old bucket of chicken wings, you wouldn't do it, you just wouldn't.</p><p>Or -- or you -- or you would get some free range chickens and -- if you could.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You can eat them. He just went -- I don't want to hear it.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: He's making chicken noises.</p><p>IMUS: Making chicken noises. He doesn't want to hear about it.</p><p>RUFINO: No, no, no, no --</p><p>IMUS: Matt and Katie or Meredith, whoever is there now -- they're going to --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, come on, no.</p><p>IMUS: Are they're going to sit there and talk to David Kirby? But what is he nuts? No, nobody is going to talk to him about it.</p><p>RUFINO: Good morning, this is today, let's talk about slaughtering animals.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it's just --</p><p>RUFINO: Let's bring the calf right over here now, what's the weather doing?</p><p>MCCORD: We hear about the screams of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: I mean, you know.</p><p>RUFINO: Let's bring Hannibal Lecter over here.</p><p>IMUS: I didn't help myself -- I didn't help myself when I got in trouble with this idiotic crusade I got into with -- over Thimerosal and all of that. So -- and this doesn't help, either, except that I'm more reasonable about it than other people at my house.</p><p>What's the big -- and the other person in my house happens to be right. You have to do what you got to do. What is the big news story, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: The 6.9 magnitude earthquake in a province in western China where it is known that at least 400 people have died and maybe 10,000 or more hurt. And the casualty count is expected to go higher, I-man. They've had some aftershocks in the 5.2 range.</p><p>IMUS: Aren't you going to China, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I am, yes, I'm going on Saturday night, going to be there next week to do some reporting in Shanghai and Beijing. This is an awful story, though. This is the western part of the country.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>MCSHANE: So, nowhere near there, but --</p><p>IMUS: Oh so then it's fine or not.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, of course it's not. That's not what I said, don't start that, please.</p><p>MCCORD: Why do you do that? Why do you do that?</p><p>MCSHANE: Off for a couple days and now we're going to start right there, where we left off, which is --</p><p>IMUS: By the way we missed you.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, you didn't. You didn't miss -- no.</p><p>IMUS: You're right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. I just thought we'll get that straight and then we can talk -- we actually have a lot of news. And maybe you're not interested but we have a lot of news --</p><p>IMUS: Well, if I was -- if I wasn't interested, why would I -- I don't have to put you on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh that's true. You have plenty of options, you're right.</p><p>IMUS: No, we love you. We really do like you. Well, what's going on?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, JP Morganjust reported earnings, a minute ago I talked about this on television but the -- the big bank led by Jamie Dimon probably weathered the financial crisis better than anybody else. It just reported better than expected profits, made about $3 billion last quarter which was more than they were expected to the stock price up in pre-market trading.</p><p>So that will be something to watch.</p><p>And the other piece of breaking news we have is actually on the housing market. Fewer people applying for mortgages last week. Mortgage applications went down and the mortgage rate which we watch -- you know, real people really care about, where the mortgage rate is it was 5.3 percent on the 30 year fixed mortgage last week it came down about 5.17 percent, if you are in the market for a new home. There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Those of you watching Fox Business will notice that Connell has his power tie on this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Because Jenna showed up in the electric blue dress and somehow you've got to deal with that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's not easy. It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS: Oh no, no.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS: Oh you put that girl on television and then what are you going to do? How do you follow that?</p><p>MCSHANE: It's an uphill battle but --</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Warner has sports. What's going on Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: All right, I-Man, the Yankees win the opener and the Jays Ricky Romero lost a no hitter in the 8th inning. Bulls General Manager John Paxson (ph) has challenge Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro to a fight.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces possible suspension. Beef Jerky dropped their sponsorship for Roethlisberger.</p><p>And hooray for Jim Nantz for speaking out against Tiger Woods behavior.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Jimbo.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He had Nantz from downtown.</p><p>MCCORD: Damn right.</p><p>IMUS: -- showing some guts.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: Hole in one.</p><p>IMUS: Good for him. So kicking Tiger, one Tiger is down, when it is safe to do so. So how come Nantz wasn't saying anything about Tiger, which doesn't know anything about -- about his vile language, and the way he treated fans and everybody else, when he was winning? Where was Nantz then?</p><p>WOLF: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know where Nantz was, where was he? He was -- he was carrying the company's water. That's what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: One of the Tiger -- pre-scandal.</p><p>IMUS: Exactly.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Exactly. So -- now it's safe, let's jump on him. Which is why David Kirby can't get on anything. He can't get on -- you think Jon Stewart, or everybody knows (INAUDIBLE) I like a lot. And, same with Colbert, why can't you -- and this would be -- this is perfect for them.</p><p>MCCORD: I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS: You know why he can't get on there?</p><p>MCCORD: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Because they have no guts.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, because they want ratings.</p><p>IMUS: And they want ratings.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because they want people to watch.</p><p>MCCORD: They don't want to drive the audience away.</p><p>IMUS: The Bernie Briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son, 100 year.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go Bernie.</p><p>IMUS: What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Former Congressman Eric Massa from New York, who recently resigned over, you know, the tickle party sex scandal and all of that stuff, a male aide is actually suing him right now for sexual harassment. They said the guy -- that the Congressman groped and propositioned him and other male staffers, routinely made gestures that he wanted oral sex and it also came out, that in early February --</p><p>IMUS: I've done that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's nothing new but this is really ugly right here.</p><p>MCCORD: Leave me alone.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was at a service for a dead Marine in upstate New York and afterwards they were at a Knights of Columbus Hall and he was trying to pick up the bartender at the somber, solemn occasion, was this Eric Massa. Imagine serving on board a ship with this animal, for --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: -- and he's in the Navy for like 20 years and reverend, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, he's getting, he's catching a little heat for something. He gave an interview to a New Jersey College and a wide ranging interview but among the topics, some of it was a gay marriage.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And he said that you don't go ahead and accommodate every behavior pattern that is against the ideal. There are some people who believe incest so should we accommodate them? Others believe in polygamy, should we accommodate them? Then he went on to say, \"We should act in the best interest of children, not in the seaming interest of the adults. Children are not puppies.\" He'll catch a little heat for that. But he's - - that's his position.</p><p>IMUS: What's he saying about the puppies? And hurt the puppies? Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: What are you saying?</p><p>Thirteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: I don't get that, Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They are not pets. Kids are for life.</p><p>IMUS: Oh.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: All right. Let me tell you about Chamonix. Want to get rid of the fine lines on your face? Them wrinkles, all that? Then you need Esotique, the powerful collagen builder from Chamonix. How good is this stuff? If it doesn't work, they give you your money back. Chamonix: if it doesn't work, they give you your money back.</p><p>Deirdre uses it. A jug of that Esotique, rub it on herself -- nobody has better looking skin than that girl does.

Just came out at the top of the hour, better than expected, it's helping to drive the stock up in the pre-market by more than 2 percent. The financial giant reporting a profit of 74 cents a share; it's well ahead of the 64 cents the Street was expecting.</p><p>And revenue was also ahead of expectations; the revenue number came in at $28.17 billion. The estimate was just over $26 billion. So, better than forecast for JPMorgan, which says the total firm-wide credit reserves of more than $39 billion is 5.5 percent of total loans. And the firm says it continues to see its delinquencies stabilize.</p><p>Now as for the total assets under custody at JPMorgan, more than $15 trillion in the quarter; that is up by 13 percent. And it says it extended more than $2 billion in small business credit during the quarter, a lot of question about small business lending.</p><p>And CEO Jamie Dimon says his company continues to contribute to the economic recovery of small businesses and communities. He says, \"Building on the efforts of the Obama administration, JPMorgan has expanded its own efforts to support small business.\" Dimon also saying that efforts to prevent foreclosures have produced what he described as significant results.</p><p>There is the JPMorgan stock, $46.70.</p><p>Now let's go to the futures real quick. Ahead of the trading session on Wall Street with this earnings report in, and the one last night from Intel better than expected, futures pointing higher as we head to Charles for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: Ok Connell. And the headline this morning the earthquake in China, the far western area, 6.9, remote region of the Tibetan Plateau in Qinghai province and they're figuring at least 400 people have died. Maybe 10,000 or so injured and they anticipate those figures will go up.</p><p>And the President ending the nuclear summit in Washington on an optimistic note. News conference said more than 45 world leaders have made progress and added that what they accomplished there will make this planet a safer place.</p><p>Those are a couple of the headline stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues for you right now here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) Billboard for George Thurgood and Buddy Guy, last summer out in -- appearing at one of the casinos out in Albuquerque, and man, how would you like to be in that dressing room with Buddy Guy?</p><p>MCCORD: If you can survive it.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I just received an e-mail, I ordinarily never check this until around 8:00.</p><p>RUFINO: What? Almost never check your e-mails?</p><p>IMUS: Until around 8:00.</p><p>RUFINO: That's a good one.</p><p>IMUS: And Ester says -- the literary agent over at ICM, who now has a (INAUDIBLE) -- she holds the record as world's shortest person -- she wants to hear about the chickens.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, she does want to hear it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She's the one.</p><p>IMUS: Wants to hear about the chickens. Before you go get this double-down over there at KFC, so. But there is a humane way to raise and slaughter chickens, right?</p><p>MCCORD: That is the whole thing that we're trying to get to, is that there is a better way of doing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But it's not efficient.</p><p>MCCORD: But it's not efficient and it's going to cost money. You are absolutely right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I don't want to spend $25 on a double down, I want to spend $5.</p><p>IMUS: Don't you have -- do you have any pets, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I do.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. What do you have?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Miniature Schnauzer.</p><p>IMUS: And how would you feel if the animal were tortured like they torture the chickens and the pigs and the cows -- all those other animals.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would get violent. I love that dog.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Then that's the point. That is our only point.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But I don't know the chickens.</p><p>MCCORD: The chicken is a stranger.</p><p>RUFINO: It comes on his plate.</p><p>IMUS: What do you mean you don't know the chicken?</p><p>MCGUIRK: The chickens aren't there when I come home wagging their tails, saying, \"Hey, happy to see you.\"</p><p>MCCORD: They would be if they were there.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, they would.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They'd be running around like peacocks, strutting their stuff, ignoring me. They wouldn't be as loving as the little pup.</p><p>IMUS: Cows can be.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can they?</p><p>IMUS: Of course, absolutely.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: They have feelings just like you do.</p><p>MCCORD: And pigs can certainly be.</p><p>IMUS: Pigs can be a -- can make a great pet. Or back in the '80s, a date.</p><p>RUFINO: And they can be loving.</p><p>IMUS: Or if you are Tiger, now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What the hell is going on out at that ranch?</p><p>IMUS: Anyway. It's time for a little sports and here with that is Warner Wolf. Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers. They make America's best boiler, 96 percent efficient PureFire. You all get one and stick it in your basement.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning I-man.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger met here in New York with Commissioner Roger Goodell. Prediction: a 2- or 3-game suspension by either the Steelers or the NFL without pay the start of the season.</p><p>IMUS: It ought to be the whole season.</p><p>WOLF: That is too long.</p><p>IMUS: No, it's not.</p><p>WOLF: Unless --</p><p>IMUS: Not too long for that girl.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not if it was your daughter.</p><p>WOLF: That's a good point.</p><p>IMUS: If it was my daughter he wouldn't have played football again.</p><p>WOLF: Meanwhile a beef jerky has dropped the sponsorship of Roethlisberger, Big Ben's Beef Jerky saying he gives beef jerky bad name.</p><p>You remember West Virginia coach Rick Rodriguez. Remember he abruptly left the Mountaineers, just before the Fiesta Bowl to go to (INAUDIBLE) -- you remember that?</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: Well, there may have been a good reason. NCAA investigators are now looking into possible rules violations while Rodriguez was head coach.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, darn.</p><p>WOLF: And to make it worse, Michigan is also under investigation where he's 3-and 9 and 5-7.</p><p>Baseball Jays Ricky Romero, had a no hitter broken up in the 8th inning while beating the White Sox, their only hit.</p><p>Here was Romero's wife, Ricky Romero's wife who wondered if his close call to history would go to his head.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not even cold yet and Ricky is lining up girls to take my place --</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: And finally -- how about that -- and finally, my time is up.

Time for the Fox Business Networkbusiness report and here with that is Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm good.</p><p>IMUS: What's going on?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's talk about Toyota and namely Lexus. Toyota has temporarily halted sales of that Lexus SUV that Consumer Reports yesterday morning said \"do not buy\". This is the Lexus GX 460. And, for people watching on TV, we're watching video from Consumer Reports. And, tight turns, the vehicle apparently fish-tails, and there is the possibility of a rollover.</p><p>Now a Lexus spokesman telling \"The Wall Street Journal\" engineers in the U.S. and Japan are working to reproduce the test. Hope to determine the cause of this by the end of the week and it could be tires. It could be suspension, could be shocks. It could be as simple as just reprogramming the stability control.</p><p>IMUS: Where is Rollo -- not Rollo -- What is his name?</p><p>RUFINO: Jasper.</p><p>IMUS: What is your husband's name?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jonas.</p><p>IMUS: Where is he this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's probably getting up and getting ready to walk the dog right now. Why?</p><p>IMUS: I just wondered. Listen to the way she asks that. Why. I just wondered where he was.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why are you asking me that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why do you wonder where my husband is at 7:30 a.m.? That maybe he left the house last night, after a little spat. Maybe the -- You know, maybe he's not there. That he's out gallivanting around somewhere. I don't know. What are you implying?</p><p>IMUS: Did you have a spat last night?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Life is a big spat, isn't it?</p><p>IMUS: Did you see that Warner? How her eyes shifted.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I-man. She's lying.</p><p>IMUS: And, you didn't answer the question, yes or no.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was being very difficult last night.</p><p>IMUS: You were?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I can't imagine that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just fussing about just random stuff. So I will reform my ways and be a better wife today. I hope.</p><p>IMUS: I brought my assorted organic nuts in a bag this morning, these are -- what I get to eat for the week.</p><p>MCCORD: You are going through them like, you know -- water through a goose, for crying out loud. What are you doing? You're going to eat the whole week's worth now?</p><p>IMUS: Last night I had two radishes for dinner and a couple of artichoke hearts.</p><p>MCCORD: The heavy meal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, you are not setting a good example for vegetarianism. You're telling people you don't eat meat, don't chicken, don't eat beat but then it makes you grumpy.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not telling people not to eat meat. You're wrong about that. I have friends who are cattle ranchers. I'm not saying that at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're right.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not saying don't eat chicken. I am not saying that. No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No. Damn it.</p><p>IMUS: People don't have to do what I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I misspoke. I'm just saying that you are not setting the best example.</p><p>IMUS: I'm obviously exaggerating.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Clearly.</p><p>IMUS: Clearly -- When I get home --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh really.</p><p>IMUS: I will get my -- chewed out, because that's what she says. And then Wyatt, the little parrot chimes in and says, \"I told you, mom.\" And I didn't really have a radish. Nobody believes that, but she thinks they do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I wasn't talking about that.</p><p>IMUS: I hope he leaves you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm talking about how grumpy you are in the morning.</p><p>IMUS: I'm sorry I said that. I said I hope he leaves you but I didn't mean that.</p><p>MCCORD: He's already gone.</p><p>IMUS: That was my anger. That was my anger -- that was my cancer talking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh my word. Oh, my word, that is terrible.</p><p>IMUS: I know. I said I apologize. What do you want me to do? I'm sorry. I apologize. Please accept --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You are asking a woman what you want to do, I can come up with a whole list. I have a brand new note pad right here, let me start writing it down --</p><p>IMUS: We look forward to that, next hour.

The bank reporting a better than expected earnings that we've been reporting on this hour, seeing improving trends on consumer loans and mortgages, hopeful for a strong economic recovery according to the CEO Jamie Dimon, 46.89.</p><p>Now, let's run through the rest of your \"FOX Business Minute\" with President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today talking about financial regulatory reform. Treasury Secretary Geithner saying, and this is a quote, \"Republicans won't want to be on the wrong side of this.\" But Republican Mitch McConnell did say that the Democrat's plan will not solve any problems and it will provide endless protection for the banks.</p><p>Big banks, meantime, are fighting against tough derivatives rules, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, all telling the Senate Agriculture Committee stricter rules will limit their profits.

Thirty-four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network. What's the matter with you? You look like you're choking.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's pollen. I think that's the problem.</p><p>IMUS: David Kirby who we've been talking about all morning, is a \"Huffington Post\" contributor, that's too bad. And author of the \"New York Times\" best seller \"Evidence of Harm\" winner of the 2005 investigative reporters' and editors' award for best book and finalist for the New York Public Library Helen Bernstein Award for Excellence in Journalism. He lives over there in Brooklyn. His new book is called \"Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial, Pig, Dairy and Poultry Farms to Human Environment\" and nobody wants to read it.</p><p>DAVID KIRBY, AUTHOR: No-body.</p><p>IMUS: They're selling one book a day at Amazon.</p><p>KIRBY: Travesty.</p><p>IMUS: And it's a major publisher St. Marten is not some chump self-published deal, so -- please welcome to the program our old friend David Kirby.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Kirby.</p><p>KIRBY: Thanks Mr. Imus, thanks for having me back on. You know, when I first -- when the book came out March 2 and started selling fairly well, but right now not doing as good.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you can't get on any of these programs.</p><p>KIRBY: Not yet. National broadcast and television has not really responded.</p><p>IMUS: Well, what, what in your head told you that \"Today Show\" or FOX and fiends or \"Good Morning America\" wants to have you on to talk about how they -- how meat's processed or poultry or pigs or that sort of thing?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, it's a topic that people don't want to face. I mean, I would say my book is more than just a catalog of horrors. It does tell real stories about real people. NPR online said it reads like a thriller, the compared it to Upton Sinclair, BookList said it was compelling...</p><p>IMUS: NPR sucks.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, NPR...</p><p>IMUS: Dreadful.</p><p>KIRBY: You know, I was scheduled to go on one of their shows and they canceled me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course they did.</p><p>KIRBY: They said they were a little tired of the topic.</p><p>IMUS: Well no, they don't want to hear about the topic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody does.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you sent a copy to the president and first lady. What did they -- and actually liked it. What did they do?</p><p>KIRBY: Have not heard back from anybody at the White House.</p><p>IMUS: No, no. You know why the president and the first lady don't want to talk about this?</p><p>KIRBY: Why is that?</p><p>IMUS: Or why the president doesn't care about how food is processed? Because every time you see them they got a hamburger in their hand. Every time you see the president and first lady they're at some hamburger joint. I mean, they've got -- my wife is saying that's got to be -- I mean, you don't just snap snapshots of the president that are not rehearsed or not at least planned.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, I'd like to talk about the Obama's if I could, because on one hand I wrote a piece for \"Washington Post\" online outling what Obama had promised and this helped him win the Iowa caucuses taking a stance against these factory farms and he was doing pretty well, but then I wanted to ask myself a couple other questions after I wrote the piece, for example, under the Bush administration we fed cattle to cattle in three different ways, blood products are given to dairy cows as a formula, we feed restaurant scraps to cattle and we feed, believe it or not, chicken crap to cattle.</p><p>Now, we feed cattle to chickens and when they eat that feed, it spills into their litter. We have so much litter, we can't spread it as fertilizer so what do we do we feed it to our cows. Now, Mrs. Obama talks about her organic garden and how children need eat healthy lunches and everything, and they let the FDA permit the feeding of, starts with an \"S\" and ends in \"hit\" to our children. And if people think that's boring, then there's not much I can do about it.</p><p>IMUS: Let me say something to you and I'm going to speak quietly and slowly. The president, as every other politician who's ever run for anything, says all kind of stuff when they're running. They have no intention of honoring what -- any pledge they made during the campaign, none.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, if he were to honor...</p><p>IMUS: Name one who did.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, I can't.</p><p>IMUS: No, of course not. And Obama's no different, doesn't make him any worse or any better than anybody else. As Matt Taibbi pointed out, he's talked about a new -- for example, a new culture on Wall Street, The day he got elected, not the day that he was sworn in, the day he got elected, he called every crook he knew on Wall Street, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers and Geithner and the rest of these clowns.</p><p>So no, they have no interest in this. So, my question, and Charles -- talking to Charles about this last night -- so, how do we get people -- because I (INAUDIBLE) talked to (INAUDIBLE), there's a smart guy. You can't get-- nobody wants to hear about this and they don't want to hear about the horror stories about how this -- these products were processed. So, my question for you is, is it possible to meet the demand, the commercial demand for meat and poultry and all of that stuff in this country, the McDonald's, KFC, in a more humane way, to raise the animals more humanely, to slaughter them more humanely? Is that possible?</p><p>KIRBY: Absolutely, we just need more farmers. Two percent of the population produces 100 percent of the food. What if we doubled that? We have a jobs crisis in this country, why not let young people and young families get into farming and make the rules more fair, get rid of the subsidies for the grain that we feed these animals. Put a ban on antibiotic use unless you're treating a sick animal. Make sure that producers can get their animals to the market through humane and regional processing plants. We don't have any of those things in this country and those are the types of things that Obama ran on.</p><p>IMUS: That sound like a generational thing, doesn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: But, can a family farm, a family farmer actually make money, can they get by now.</p><p>KIRBY: Oh, absolutely. Yes, grass fed, pasture fed...</p><p>IMUS: Who owns these factory farms? Tyson chicken, those people?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, they contract with individual farmers who own the debt and the manure, the companies own the animals and they basically pay these people to babysit the animals until they grow up.</p><p>IMUS: So the animals are raised, slaughtered this way because it's cheaper to do? Must be.</p><p>KIRBY: It's much cheaper and it's more profitable for the companies. The problem comes...</p><p>IMUS: And yet, on the other hand, it causes a catastrophic health care cost.</p><p>KIRBY: Catastrophic, and I was not even aware how bad it is. In addition to feeding chicken crap it our cows, a brand new report that came out on Friday, as bad reports always do, not getting a lot of coverage in the media on residue program for cattle in this country and this is a USDA document, and they said that the USDA, it's from the inspector general -- is not doing its job and they found in our beef drugs, heavy metals and pesticides. These all come from the factory farm setting.</p><p>IMUS: What are you eating, Bernard (ph)? What are you having?</p><p>MCCORD: Eggs and bacon.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: And you're sitting there talking about feeding chicken crap to chickens and cows and then you wonder why you can't get on any of these programs? What, have you lost your mind?</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>IMUS: And he's over there, he's got his head phones off, I'm looking at him and Bernard's a smart guy, he's got his head phones off and eating bacon and eggs and Bernard reads everything. Would you read \"Animal Factory,\" Bernard.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would give it a look.</p><p>IMUS: You would?</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know, I'm -- well, maybe it would go on the back burner, I don't know I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS: Why people -- I'm not sure I'd read it. I mean, I'm trying to get you to read it, but I have a really weak stomach (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>MCCORD: No, I know you do.</p><p>KIRBY: But this is not, again, just about all the terrible things that happen at these factory farms, it's about people who are defending their communities, bringing in greater regulations and more enforcement and promoting an alternative way of raising animals in this country in a way that is humane and sustainable and can produce affording food that's healthy.</p><p>And again, if you're not interested in the pollution, if you're not interested in the animal rights, if you're not interested in what's happening to people who live near these facilities, this is a catalog of horrors of the stuff that we put in the feed that these animals eat and the residue that's left behind: arsenic, copper, antibiotics, these can cues nural toxicity, the can cause developmental delays, they can cause a whole host of illnesses and this is in our food that we're feeding to our children.</p><p>MCCORD: When they're spread on these acres of land, nothing they have nothing else to do with the animal waste, the heavy metals, particularly, go into the soil and remain there forever, they cannot being removed.</p><p>KIRBY: I've seen crop land where you can't plant anything because the hog waste has so much copper and zinc in it. And copper in our beef is a real problem. And you know, I know this is, we're on a business channel on the news, this is a massive business story and it's not getting reported. Swine flu...</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you're not going to get -- do you think that Cavuto is going to put you on? What are you, crazy?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, I went on CNBC a while ago...</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well they suck.</p><p>KIRBY: ...about a year ago, because the swine flu, about a year ago came out, I went on and they reported that this was hurting the hog industry, it's cost the hog industry a billion dollars.</p><p>IMUS: And that's their angle. If you tried to get on like Jon Stewart or Colbert or any of those shows?</p><p>KIRBY: Yeah, I have. Colbert had the same response as NPR and Stewart we haven't heard back from.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no...</p><p>KIRBY: There's funny stuff in here. I mean we have crap bubbles in Indiana...</p><p>IMUS: You're not going to get on those shows because they're not going to whale on somebody unless it's safe to do that.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: And it's not safe to whale on factory farms and these huge conglomerates, but -- and what we're saying, and what I think you're saying is, and it sounds contradictory, but you're not saying don't eat meat or don't eat poultry or any other...</p><p>KIRBY: Of course not.</p><p>IMUS: What you're saying is that we don't have a happy little pigs and chickens and cows running around the old barnyard anymore, that's not what's happening.</p><p>KIRBY: But we can go back to at least partially getting our food from that way and I think eventually we're going to have to get rid of these factory farms altogether because of these diseases, because of what's in the food, because of things like swine flu and MRSA, it's very important that people know where their food comes from.</p><p>IMUS: Not only the diseases that the animals contract, in fact, Deidre told me that the 70 percent of the world's antibiotics are consumed by animals.</p><p>KIRBY: Yes, they are. In this country and farmers can go to the feed store and buy...</p><p>IMUS: The other 30 percent, by the way, are consumed by me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You were saying?</p><p>KIRBY: They can go to the feed store and buy antibiotics without a prescription, they can buy it by the barrel full.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I wish people would read your book, you know, \"Animal Factory,\" I mean, it's wonderfully well written and researched and I know you worked hard on it.</p><p>MCCORD: It's heart of the message that is so important in that dadgum (ph) book is that alternatives exist.</p><p>KIRBY: Absolutely. I mean, there is a positive message to this whole story, it's that it doesn't have to be this way. And it is changing. Demand for organic food growth by 20 percent every year. People are starting to learn they don't want drugs and metals and pesticides in their food especially for their children. And by the way, I am going around the country and in local markets the media has been very, very responsive and very interested and I actually do a lot of interviews even here in New York City I did WNYC and WOR radio...</p><p>IMUS: Yeah, but you got to get on something -- I mean, we can sell books here, one of the few places, but you got to get -- you know, you're not getting on Oprah, she's the last, or she's a nice lady and all of that, I suppose.</p><p>KIRBY: Certainly.</p><p>IMUS: But she's the last person on earth that's going to get on this crusade.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, \"Oprah\" magazine did do a Q&amp;A with me in the April issue, so that was helpful.</p><p>IMUS: Except for that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>That's a step. Good for Oprah on that one.</p><p>KIRBY: There's a lot of money in advertising animal products and I think the advertisers are concerned about this getting on, too, because they're afraid when people find out where the food comes from they are going to buy alternatives and alternatives are available.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it doesn't have to happen overnight, but I come back to, I mean, if I don't want it know about it, and I don't eat meat and I don't eat fish or chicken (INAUDIBLE), and who does? I mean, I talk to people they don't want to know about it.</p><p>KIRBY: Why won't people acknowledge where their food comes from? It just seems very important.</p><p>IMUS: Oh no, I agree with you and Charles.</p><p>KIRBY: And you know, I can understand that. When I see stories about the nuclear proliferation, I get so scared...</p><p>IMUS: Charles goes down to the diner, there where he lives, that big mansion he has out there.</p><p>MCCORD: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: And has a turkey club sandwich...</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I do. You bet.</p><p>IMUS: But you don't know...</p><p>MCCORD: But, I would rather know where it came from and that the turkey was a happy little bird.</p><p>IMUS: Oh. And here is another thing.</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: Getting into parallel universe stuff here, also, and I believe that you take on the karma of the tormented turkey.</p><p>MCCORD: I understand.</p><p>IMUS: The tormented tortured turkey.</p><p>MCCORD: That's why I'm miserable.</p><p>IMUS: That's force fed chicken feces.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, god.</p><p>IMUS: Well, if we have any listeners left this morning out there, we could count them on one hand, but I hope, I hope we can sell this for you. I hope you can sell it.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, thanks, Don, I think it's an important story.</p><p>IMUS: Also, you ought to get a Pulitzer Prize for this. I'm -- that's what you ought to get. Of course, this, when \"Silent Spring,\" Rachel Carson's book came out, nobody wanted to read it. No one. Nearly ran around the country had no interest, they thought she was insane. So, same could be said for you. We happen to know you are insane, and you're right about that.</p><p>KIRBY: My next book is going to be on puppies or something.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, David Kirby, buy the book this morning, I mean, here's what you do, you buy the book and just put it on the coffee table and somebody walks in say, well yeah, I read that. \"Animal Factory,\" David Kirby from St. Martin's Press. Go to BarnesAndNoble.com, go to Amazon, go someplace, buy this thing. Thanks, David.</p><p>KIRBY: Thanks, Don.</p><p>IMUS: Thanks for grossing us all out.

Mr. Obama saying a move for China towards a more marketed oriented approach is the right one.</p><p>Greece successfully raises $2 billion through a bond sale. The demand for its bond is seen as a good sign that it can keep raising money without accepting a bailout, but the interest rate of 4-1/2 percent is too high for the country to afford over the long-term.</p><p>And get this, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch paying the CEO to stop using the corporate jet. The company saying it will pay the $200,000 worth of flights for CEO Michael Jeffries each year, after that, he has to pay the company back and to help him with that, Abercrombie is giving him a $4 million lump sum. Not bad.</p><p>That's a look at your European markets.

Is it going to come to that?</p><p>SHIEFFER: Well, I would suppose not. I thought about that. I mean, you know, when -- well, I don't know, I don't think so. I don't think he's going to resign, but you know, I'm always reluctant to criticize somebody's religion or the church.</p><p>I'm a great respecter of the Catholic Church. I mean, they really were the kind of the crucible, the place where knowledge and scholarship, that's where it was all through the Dark Ages and so forth and the Catholic Church, along with Judaism, is really where all our Western values came from and we're the product of those values, but it's just heartbreaking to see something like the church is going through right now and I mean, basically what I said was that the church and its leaders have to put their reason for being ahead of the survival of their leaders and right now, they do not appear to be doing that and until they do, I think their church is going to remain at risk.</p><p>People will seek God in many ways, but never in a way that puts their own children at risk and I think -- I think the church is at risk, right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep is here on the FOX Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments.

From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of J.P. Morgan rising in the pre-market after the bank reports better than expected numbers. It continued to see stabilization in delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. It's also seeing broad- based improvements and its hopeful for a strong economic recovery. The company expects to add 9,000 employees in the U.S. as we take a look at the stock moving higher in the pre-market.</p><p>Overseas markets rising on that and also some positive news from Intel last night. The company kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big way. Shares jumping as much as 4 percent after a profit in that quarter nearly quadrupled. Intel says it got a lift from sales of new chips for computer servers. That's the type of purchase companies have been holding off on during the recession.</p><p>And Toyota will stop selling its Lexus GX460 after \"Consumer Reports\" saying people shouldn't buy it. The company asking dealers to pull the SUV until it can do its own tests. The magazine says the SUV has an unusually high risk of rolling over. This problem reportedly has to do with the electronic stability control, not the breaks or gas pedals that's related to the massive recall for Toyota. Toyota shares were trading lower yesterday in the market.</p><p>Also, some other breaking news this morning. At least 400 people killed, many more feared dead as a series of earthquakes rocks western China. Ten thousand more are injured according to state TV and local reports say many remain buried under rubble. The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other very strong aftershocks. Charles McCord will have more on this story a little later on in the show.</p><p>All right, a quick look at the markets, though, as we head into Wednesday's session. The European markets trading up and looking like they're gaining some speed. If we take a look at our U.S. stock futures, we have been trading higher for most of the morning.</p><p>You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING here on the Fox Business Networkcoming to you next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I asked Jenna a few minutes ago, I said, where's Connell? Just curious.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So she thinks that that means -- believe me, if we had our way about it, we'd have Jenna here all the time.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: We like -- Connell's fine, but, I mean, come on, we're not stupid. So -- but immediately she cops an attitude. So.</p><p>MCCORD: What do you mean?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean she's</p><p>MCCORD: I didn't hear the exchange.</p><p>IMUS: She's very sensitive, aren't you?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh.</p><p>LEE: Well, I told you specifically because you e-mailed me to tell Connell hello. And I said -- and it was ironic because Connell e-mailed me to tell you hello. And so what I said is that if you two want it exchange love messages, you should e-mail each other directly.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a good point.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, you had e-mailed me -- by the way</p><p>LEE: Complimenting you on a wonderful article in Crane's (ph) about you.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>LEE: That you asked me to read.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>We're sitting here talking about -- with Carl Jeffers (ph) from Sling Blade and Reverend Jesse Jackson about -- and Charles, Bernie and Lou and Jenna and everybody else, about David Kirby's book, \"Animal Factory.\" And Charles just looked at me and he said, he's not going to get on anything because look at the advertising on all of these programs, including ours.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: It's fast food, it's restaurants and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean you watch the evening news, it's all pharmaceuticals. But the difference is I'm -- and it makes my wife crazy, but I'm not anti-fast food joints or the pharmaceutical industry. Taking all the drugs that I've taken in my life, why would I be?</p><p>MCCORD: Of course, you're a supporter.</p><p>IMUS: I would be a huge supporter of that. But McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, to select a couple, are in they don't care. They'll do whatever -- they'll do whatever they need to do to get you to buy the stuff.</p><p>MCCORD: To get you in that store.</p><p>IMUS: When people said they wanted salads, McDonald's started serving salads.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: When they want healthier stuff, they start -- that's fine with them. They don't care. When people started woofing on fried chicken, Kentucky Fried -- they started serving grilled chicken. They doesn't care. So if you -- so if the public demands an end to these horrific conditions that these animals are raised and slaughtered in, it will -- it's fine -- it will be fine with McDonald's or it will be fine with KFC. What do they care?</p><p>MCCORD: And the question I had, does that</p><p>IMUS: And if it costs more, it will cost you more.</p><p>MCCORD: The question I had, and is answered in Mr. Kirby's book, is that, yes, there are alternatives that exist now.</p><p>IMUS: But the money that everybody's going to save, including the country, is on health care costs.</p><p>MCCORD: That's true.</p><p>IMUS: Which are astronomical because of the stuff that's making folks sick. So, that's enough about it.</p><p>Meanwhile --</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Not really.</p><p>IMUS: And -- not really what?</p><p>MCCORD: Not really enough.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Please, elaborate.</p><p>IMUS: And while we were talking to Kirby, Bernie was sitting there eating - - I love you, Bernie. Bernie's sitting there eating bacon and eggs, weren't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: And loving every second of it.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, you bet. It's delicious.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. And yet, if they treated your dog like they treated the pig that made that bacon thing for you this morning, you'd murder the person doing it, wouldn't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would. I would indeed. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, bingo.</p><p>What's the big news story, quake in China?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, that is the still breaking news of this hour is watching the aftermath of this 6.8 magnitude earthquake in China. And 400 people are known to have died about, maybe as many as 10,000 are homeless and a lot of those people are hurt and they expect that the casualty count will go higher, I-man.</p><p>And a good news story out of the state of Florida where that little girl, 11 years old, had been missing for four days in the swamp area near Winter Spring. Densely wooded and alligator infested and all like that. And a fella found her yesterday and she is safe.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, thank God.</p><p>Jenna's here. And Connell was on last hour and he thinks that we like you better than him. Isn't that ridiculous?</p><p>LEE: That's hysterical.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, I mean it's just --</p><p>LEE: I know how much you like him.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course. So, what's coming up in business?</p><p>LEE: Well, the markets are headed higher this morning. We did get some positive results from JP Morganthat came out with their quarterly results this morning.</p><p>We're also going to get some data in about 20 minutes on the consumer, Consumer Price Index, which is going to tell us whether or not our dollar is getting us more or less these days. Also, retail sales are out and that's going to be important to the market as well.</p><p>And speaking of shopping, interesting, last night, or yesterday, a very important artifact of American history actually was bought at an auction. This is the flight plan for Apollo 11, where Neil Armstrong, obviously, the first man who walked on the moon. And this flight plan had inscribed on it, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" which is actually what he said. We often misquote him. It sold for $152,000, that flight plan.</p><p>IMUS: Why did the flight plan have that written on it?</p><p>LEE: Well, he -- I think he inscribed it afterwards, but</p><p>IMUS: I wonder -- oh, he did?</p><p>LEE: Yes, he wrote -- he wrote it on the flight plan. And often we say, you know, \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: That's actually not what he said.</p><p>IMUS: What did he say?</p><p>LEE: He said, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"</p><p>IMUS: He doesn't want to talk about it now, you know?</p><p>LEE: Yes. Well, that's why I thought you'd be interested in it.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Probably no chance of getting him on the program, is there? Well, how do you know unless you ask?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we'll effort the man.</p><p>IMUS: Why don't do you that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sure. We'll make amends. He'll probably open up about his walking on the moon now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, we'll just see if he -- yes, I want him to tell me he doesn't want to talk about it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, you want to ambush the old hero.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's very nice.</p><p>IMUS: That would be fun, don't you think?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes. Definitely.</p><p>IMUS: Jenna will be on throughout the hour. Dagen McDowell is coming up. Scott Salado (ph), our New York reporter, thinks that Dagen and her husband had a big spat and that Rollo (ph) --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: His name is not Rollo.</p><p>MCCORD: No, not Rollo, no.</p><p>IMUS: It's a --</p><p>MCCORD: Jonas. Jonas.</p><p>IMUS: Jonas left the house last night and was out stomping around in New York.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, maybe walking over that gravel he spread last weekend. We'll find out.</p><p>Sports coming up with Warner Wolf.</p><p>The Yankees won their home opener, huh, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Yes, they did, I-man, and then handed out the rings. And Hideki Matsui, the ex-Yankee, got the biggest hand of all. Bulls General Manager John Paxson apparently challenged Bull's Coach Vinny Del Negro to a fight. Dolphins get Bronco's all-pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Hurray for Jim Nantz for publicly criticizing Tiger Woods foul language at The Masters. And</p><p>IMUS: Why wasn't Jim Nantz criticizing Tiger Woods' foul language when Tiger was winning all those tournaments before he got into all that trouble.</p><p>WOLF: Ah-hah.</p><p>IMUS: See, I had no idea. Lupica never told me. Well, because I never asked him. But I had no idea that Tiger was as big a jerk as he is because I used to talk about --</p><p>MCCORD: How much fun it was. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I -- I mean, I don't play golf. I don't -- you know. The only thing I like about golf is the Great River Golf Club. I get to drive around in the cart for the Imus Ranch Golf Outing. But other than that, I</p><p>MCGUIRK: But you use to watch golf when Tiger played, right?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and cheer for Tiger not knowing that he was a jerk.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But it was on TV. He acted like a jerk publicly. It's just that everybody</p><p>IMUS: Well, I never noticed any of that.</p><p>WOLF: Nor did I.</p><p>IMUS: And Warner's one of the premier sports casters in America and he didn't notice it. If Warner Wolf doesn't notice it, how am I supposed to? I'm just a casual fan.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Got to wake the hell up then.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you're right about that, but I didn't know that he was throwing his clubs and swearing at people and being icky to the fans.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: I had no idea. Well, where was Nantz when all that was going on?</p><p>WOLF: Conspiracy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was with you. Sleeping.</p><p>IMUS: So, now that it's safe to kick Tiger --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now he's kicking him. That's weak. Really, that is weak.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Lame.</p><p>IMUS: Nantz is -- I love Nantz, and he's a very good friend of mine, but he's a pansy. And he knows he is.</p><p>WOLF: Well, maybe he's had enough. That's it.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe he has had enough.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour. Warner will have a bunch of sports. Bernard McGuirk will have the \"Bernie Briefing\" sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. Fifty-seven gorgeous stories, 100 years. Still run by the family. If you know what I knew, you wouldn't buy anything any place else, including a shirt. Well, they don't sell shirts, but you know what I mean.</p><p>MCCORD: But if they did.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>What's up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Miami basketball star all star game MVP -- Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was -- he was at a Manhattan club in the meat packing district just recently and Carmine Gotti, remember from that stupid show, \"Growing up Gotti,\" growing up snotty, whatever you want to call it. He wanted today meet Dwyane Wade and Dwyane said -- reportedly said, according to \"The New York Post,\" \"there's no way I'm meeting the Gottis or having my photo taken with them.\" Anyway, he left. Their bodyguards got into a fight. Carmine was upset. And, but, anyway, good for Dwyane Wade. He didn't want to meet the little -- the punk who makes the kids -- the kids on the Jersey shore look like the Brady Bunch.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But -- and Conan O'Brien is pushing George Lopez's show on TBS. By the way, did you know he had a show on TBS? Did anybody know?</p><p>IMUS: I did, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: At 11 p.m.</p><p>IMUS: Because I watch basketball, so.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right. Well, it's being pushed back --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't watch basketball. I watch Charles Barclay. Different. Yes, I knew. Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, right, but it wasn't getting much traction. So, anyways</p><p>IMUS: Well, it got (ph) no traction.</p><p>MCGUIRK: None at all. And so Conan's coming in. He's getting pushed back to midnight. People are saying</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's getting -- Lopez is getting pushed back to midnight by Conan.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, he is.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Conan's 11:00 and now they're going to put Lopez on at midnight. And some people are saying he's getting dissed. He's getting the Conan treatment. The treatment that Conan got at NBC, he's getting now, ironically, by Conan and TBS.</p><p>IMUS: Well, the story that they're circulating is, that in order to close the deal --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: George Lopez actually called Conan.</p><p>MCCORD: He's good with all of that, yes.</p><p>IMUS: And talked him into doing this.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And is fine with all of it and all that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, sure. Right.</p><p>IMUS: I mean</p><p>MCGUIRK: But, anyway, Chris Rock and -- was on the Lopez tonight show last night and they talked about it and here's a little piece of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE LOPEZ, \"THE GEORGE LOPEZ SHOW\": I think you're here on a good night.</p><p>CHRIS ROCK: Yes.</p><p>LOPEZ: I couldn't think of a better guest to be here.</p><p>ROCK: There's no bad nights on \"The George Lopez Show.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That's funny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOPEZ: But with Conan coming to TBS.</p><p>ROCK: Yes, yes. Conan's coming?</p><p>LOPEZ: Yes.</p><p>ROCK: And where are you going?</p><p>LOPEZ: I'm going -- I'm staying. I'm going to midnight. He's coming at 11:00 and I'm going to midnight.</p><p>ROCK: Get the hell out of here. So you're going to move for the white man, huh?</p><p>LOPEZ: I am. I am. Hey</p><p>ROCK: I hope he appreciates this.</p><p>LOPEZ: I think the white man does appreciate it very much.</p><p>ROCK: OK. And you don't got to clean a park or nothing, right?</p><p>LOPEZ: No.</p><p>ROCK: OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: No. And I get to go to work an hour later.</p><p>ROCK: OK. OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: That's a Latino dream come true, to go to work later.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get the hell out of here! Anyway, that happened last night. Enjoying that politically incorrect humor is always refreshing. And so Lopez apparently cool with it and everybody's happy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Except the I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean, it's fine.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did you just eat a lemon or</p><p>IMUS: No, they're just two unfunny schmucks. No. So, whatever.</p><p>Here's Chuck with a little news.</p><p>Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: At least 400 people dead, thousands injured, others buried beneath the rubble after this series of strong earthquakes we reported in western China. The Tibetan plateau area. Wood homes collapsed. People in the streets looking for safety, look for relatives. The U.S. Geological Survey said the main quake was 6.9 and there have been aftershocks in the 5.2 area.</p><p>Then in India, police say a cyclone diminished thousands of huts, uprooted trees in several villages in eastern India and at least 68 people are dead as a result of that.</p><p>And then the story out of Florida today. The good news story. The little girl's voice on the 911 call, faint by cheerful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADIA BLOOM: Hi. Hi. Yes, I'm the girl that got lost.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And there you go. That is 11-year-old Nadia Bloom.</p><p>IMUS: How long was she missing?</p><p>MCCORD: Four days all alone out in an extraordinarily densely --</p><p>IMUS: Oh my God. Man.</p><p>MCCORD: Dense area of the swamp. Took people three hours to carry her out of the area. And there was a fellow who was a member of her church who said he actually did get a divinely inspired message of where this little girl would be. Went to there. Fought his way through. Actually had to go through with machetes and found her alive and they got her out.</p><p>IMUS: Here's the problem, Bernie, with the Chris Rock, George Lopez bit. It actually was funny the first time I heard it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, and I just forgot to -- I just forgot to program myself --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: To pretend I hadn't heard it before.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, that was two hours ago.</p><p>IMUS: It was two hours ago and, by the way, it's remarkable that I remembered that it was on two hours ago. Well, why wouldn't George Lopez, who is, who can be funny, why -- why wouldn't he want this? Why not?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, because, you know, he's not the -- he's not the man any more. He's not the alpha male at TBS.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but he wasn't going to be the man anyway.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, that's true. I mean, in a sense, he should welcome it because it's going to bring him some attention and maybe some ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because he was sort of floundering and faltering.</p><p>IMUS: So it's good for everybody.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour. One of my five favorite Dwight Yoakam songs of all time. This was his first hit.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of JP Morganrising in the pre-market after the bank reports better than expected earnings. JP Morgancontinues to see stabilization and delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. The company seeing broad- based improvements and is hopeful for a strong economic recovery. CEO Jamie Dimon says he does not know if regulators will allow the company to boost the dividend now.</p><p>President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today to talk about financial regulation reform. Treasury Secretary Geithner saying, quote, \"Republicans won't want to be on the wrong side of this,\" but Republican Mitch McConnell saying the Democrat's plan won't solve any problems and will provide endless protection for banks.</p><p>Big banks fighting against some tough derivative rules now. Goldman Sachs, JP Morganand Morgan Stanley telling the Senate Agriculture Committee stricter rules will limit profits. The Agriculture Committee can submit a different proposal for reform than the Banking Committee already has. But the committee chairman, Blanche Lincoln, is expected to propose a more aggressive approach with sweeping changes to the derivatives market. So we'll watch that play out.</p><p>A quick look at futures now as we hand it over to Charles for this morning's other top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And a developing story this morning. The China earthquake. China struggling with the aftermath of a major quake. This time a magnitude 6.9 jolt in the far western Tibetan plateau area. Officials report at least 400 people dead, more than 10,000 injured. And police are digging through the rubble of homes. There have been a number of aftershocks.</p><p>Then, to India, where police say a cyclone demolished thousands of huts and uprooted trees there. Several villages involved in eastern India. And they say at least 68 people have died as a result of that.</p><p>President Obama calling the commitments from the two day nuclear security conference, Washington, at once bold and pragmatic, promising to follow up on the results, including a progress summit in two years.</p><p>And then, up to 10,000 people expected as Sarah Palin addresses another Tea Party rally today. This time, Boston. Next to last event at a Tea Party Express tour that wraps tomorrow in Washington.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE I'm coughing as nobody's taking a (INAUDIBLE) for me. But, anyway, what would you do if I died, just sit there?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: No, everybody's just --</p><p>MCCORD: No, that's when -- that's when --</p><p>IMUS: No, what would you do? I'm kind of curious.</p><p>MCCORD: That's when the rockets (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: What would you do? If I suddenly keeled over dead, would you just sit there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Dance.</p><p>MCCORD: Ad the confetti.</p><p>IMUS: And dead air. I'm dead and there's dead air? Is that what happens for the rest of the morning?</p><p>MCCORD: Probably so.</p><p>RUFINO: Knowing you, you'd wake up and go, this is what happens when I die. This is what you'll get.</p><p>IMUS: I'm coughing and he just sits there. All of them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It's a party in the USA.</p><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Robotic Urology.</p><p>RUFINO: I don't see him moving, Chuck.</p><p>IMUS: So, we're talking about \"Animal Factory.\" David Kerby's book from St. Martins Press. Bit time publisher, big time book. The guy had a huge \"New York Times\" best seller with \"Evidence of Harm,\" about Thimerosal in these vaccines.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: \"Animal Factory.\" What number is it at Barnes &amp; Noble, Bigfoot?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS SHOW: Barnes &amp; Noble right now, it's moving up. It's number 41,477.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes.</p><p>BOWMAN: And on Amazon it's 10, 994. So, I mean, the good news is, it can only go up from here, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, there are books that are lower than 41,000 on BNN and lower than, of course, 10,000 on Amazon. But --</p><p>MCCORD: What about number 41,400 and what is it, 78 is? One beneath it.</p><p>RUFINO: How to cook a great steak.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. But, I mean, it's got to be --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, you eat meat, don't you?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Not that much, though. A hamburger. That's about it.</p><p>IMUS: Do you care how the cow was raised or slaughtered for that burger?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Not at all?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: So you don't care about how the animals are treated?</p><p>WOLF: Well, sure, but I don't think about it when I order a hamburger.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go. That's --</p><p>IMUS: So that's -- but you do care about it.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: You just don't think about it?</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, well, think about it next time. Do you have -- do you have any pets?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, two dogs. Two Jack Russells.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, really?</p><p>WOLF: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: How would you feel if we treated your Jack Russells like they treat these cows?</p><p>WOLF: Terrible.</p><p>RUFINO: No, you lost.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's -- there's a better way to do it. I'm saying, you can still have your hamburger, but there's a better way to do it.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't want to hear about it, do you?</p><p>RUFINO: No one wants --</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody --</p><p>RUFINO: Nobody wants to hear about how</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody wants to hear about --</p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCGUIRK: Just want to get through the day.</p><p>IMUS: So I'll just stop talking about it.</p><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE) nothing left to eat. Man. Geez. I want to eat something, Warner (ph).</p><p>IMUS: No, no, you can eat what I eat. You can have a radish and this bag of nuts. That's what you can have.</p><p>RUFINO: What is that, the hungry man meal?</p><p>MCGUIRK: There's people starving in Haiti, for God's sakes.</p><p>IMUS: And they're talking about how they need all these factory farms to meet the food supply. They're not meeting the -- the food demands. They're not meeting the food demands. There are 12 million kids in this country go to bed hungry every night. Could be more than that, actually. Look at the number of people around the world who are starving. So they're not meeting the food demand at all, are they? Please. God, please shut up. I'm begging you. I'm even telling myself, just please shut up.</p><p>RUFINO: Just let him go and he'll stop.</p><p>IMUS: It's 27 after the hour. We're already late for Tom Friedman. Quickly, just give me the couple of big sports stories. Then we'll go to Dagen. Then we'll get to Tom.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, we're hungry, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Warner.</p><p>WOLF: All right. Yankees win. The Mets lost. John Maine lasted only three innings, seven hits, eight --</p><p>IMUS: And a -- let me have an extra sausage patty.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, come on, three more. Pile it on.</p><p>WOLF: The Dolphins have just acquired Bronco's all pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. And the big NBA story, two weeks ago, Bulls General Manager John Paxson charged into the office of Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro, grabbed him by the tie, poked him in the chest and challenged him to a fight because of Del Negro's use of Joakim Noah, who had a bad foot.</p><p>And that's it. On the tree tops.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Thank you very much, Warner.</p><p>Time for a little business news. From Fox Business Network, here's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: Poor Scott Salado thinks that you and your husband had this huge fight and old Rollo was out there walking around in the yard, or Jonas, out there walking around in the yard, tromping on the gravel he spread last weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I just spent the last hour trying to get him on the phone, cell phone, not answering, house phone, not answering. Finally got him on the phone and then he refreshed my memory what the fight was about. You know what? I was in the right, doggone it. The dog smelled like skunk. He didn't wan to get off his duff and wash him. And then he sassed me. So, there you go.</p><p>IMUS: Who sassed you, Rollo?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he sassed me. Wouldn't wash the skunk smell off the dog and then he sassed me. Don't sass me. And, by the way, everybody bitches and moans about the wife, about the moods and she's so unpredictable. But you know what? When the wife takes charge and gets stuff done and when somebody's yapping on their cell phone on the train, it's the woman who tells him to shut up. Somebody cuts in line at the movie theater, it's the woman who tells them, get at the back of the line, buddy! You know what, so, it's a trade-off, isn't it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Grow a pair.</p><p>IMUS: I'm choking to death here --</p><p>RUFINO: I'm scared.</p><p>IMUS: And nobody's going to talk to you unless it's me, so --</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>IMUS: I've got to go. I'm dying. But, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I worry about you, man.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, do you have any business news?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you -- in 20 seconds, we're going to get retail sales and consumer prices out. That's what</p><p>IMUS: You're God damn nuts. That's -- here's -- what do you think?</p><p>MCCORD: You -- you -- well, why did you persist?</p><p>IMUS: Well, because my idiot wife, she says, \"Well, then take nuts.\" And I've tried to tell her a million times, you can't eat nuts if you're on the air. You can't eat them.</p><p>MCCORD: No, because they're dry and they irritate your throat.</p><p>What's the matter with you? You know that.</p><p>IMUS: Jesus Christ.</p><p>MCCORD: And you're eating a week's worth of nuts in one setting.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Talk about role reversals here.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God.</p><p>IMUS: It's just ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You want me to cut in and rescue you?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Consumer prices were up .1 of a percent in March. That's as expected. And the core is unchanged, which is a little bit lower than expected. So that's all good news. If you're going out to go shopping at the grocery store for any food --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or nuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- or nuts -- I do worry about you, man. Somebody pat you on the back.</p><p>IMUS: That's fine. .</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're worried about you touching you, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Charles would sit there and watch me die and just go -- and be looking for the balloons to blow up.</p><p>MCCORD: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Tom Friedman is next.</p><p>This is one of Tom Friedman's favorite songs. I have no idea who it is or what it is, and I don't care.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>LEE: All right, everybody. We do have some breaking news now. Dagen just touched on it briefly.</p><p>The Consumer Price Index just in to us, a rise of .1 of a percent, the headline number. The core number, if you exclude those volatile food and energy prices, is unchanged, similar to January, where we saw that unchanged as well.</p><p>We were taking a look and seeing whether gas prices really were a factor here, and the number doesn't appear to be -- that was something we were looking at, to see if maybe there was a jump in the Consumer Price Index. It's something we were looking at as far as its factor in retail sales as well.</p><p>Retail sales are up 1.6 percent for March. That's also a little bit higher than expected. We were looking at 1.2 percent as the rise.</p><p>We have seen a drop in hourly wages, so we're taking a look to see if that was going to affect retail in March, which has been a very unpredictable month, in part because of the weather. But again, up for March.</p><p>Also, a little bit higher when we take out motor vehicle sales. The number was up .6 of a percent. That's a .1 of a percent higher than expected. It's the largest jump in retail sales that we've seen since November of 2009.</p><p>That's one of the headlines that's crossing at this time.</p><p>If we can, let's go ahead -- oh, we're already there. You beat me to it.</p><p>A look at stock futures right now. Take a look at -- oh, excuse me. I'm keep getting interrupted just because of some other breaking news at this time.</p><p>Apple just out with some breaking news, delaying the international launch of the iPad. We're going to take a look at some of the headlines that have to do with that and bring more details to you throughout the morning.</p><p>There's look at the stock again. This news hitting just right now, that Apple is postponing the international launch of the iPad by one month. Demand, Apple says, is far higher than predicted.</p><p>So we'll take a look at these headlines and be right back with more IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know if I'm really interested in you and the producer of \"The Jersey Boys\" trying to solve what's going on.</p><p>BO DIETL, BO DIETL &amp; ASSOCIATES: And Charlie Rose, one of the most prolific interviewers of all time. No, Charlie? My man Charlie. Well, in any case--</p><p>IMUS: Charlie Rose, the guy on PBS?</p><p>DIETL: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two legged Ambien pill.</p><p>IMUS: The two legged -- Bernie describes him right, the two-legged Ambien pill.</p><p>DIETL: Oh, no. He's a very smart man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's on public TV for a reason.</p><p>IMUS: That bus left the station a long time ago. That ship has sailed years ago.</p><p>DIETL: We're talking about the economy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he is. He's unlike me. He will not be getting his mojo back. That is not going to happen.</p><p>DIETL: He's right there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Apple calling the iPad a runaway success. That's what they're saying this morning. Let's take a look at the Apple stock, which is moving in the pre-market on very strong volume on the news that Apple is delaying the launch of its iPad internationally because it's saying that, really, it can't keep up with demand.</p><p>So we're keeping an eye on this stock, raising one percent in the pre- market. Apple saying this morning that it has already delivered more than a half-million iPads during this first week. And again, it looks like stronger demand that it is prepared for, delaying the launch of the iPad internationally, and you can see the stock moving higher.</p><p>Back to more IMUS IN THE MORNING now.</p><p>IMUS: Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, on the Fox Business Network, on more radio stations, doing better than we've ever done. And why? Because there's no God, that's why, Charles.</p><p>Please welcome from \"The New York Times\" a man who has one three Pulitzer Prizes.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Tom Friedman.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Hey. Good morning, Don.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I was talking -- before we talk about your very fine column this morning on idealism versus realism, and Iraq and Afghanistan, if that's the proper way to describe it, when you wrote your green book, what was that called, \"Hot, Flat, and --</p><p>FRIEDMAN: \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded.\"</p><p>IMUS: Did you write about these animal factories?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I don't know what you're talking about, Don. Sorry.</p><p>IMUS: Well, the animal factories are these huge, huge --</p><p>MCCORD: Huge installations that -- from which we derive almost all our food supplies now so far as poultry and dairy and meat is concerned. And hundreds of thousands of animals are involved, many times in a single place, and the way they're treated and the environmental consequences that derive from that.</p><p>IMUS: The environmental impact, health care impact --</p><p>MCCORD: It's huge.</p><p>IMUS: -- is catastrophic. And a friend of mine, David Kirby, who wrote \"Evidence of Harm,\" which was about thimerosal in vaccines -- of course, nobody wanted to talk about either --</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: -- has written this from St. Martin's Press. And he can't -- I had him on this morning, but he can't get -- nobody want to hear about it and nobody wants to talk about it, including, apparently, you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm sure it's important, and of all the different forms of environmental degradation going on there, I'm sure it's really important. It just was not on my radar screen. Something I'm sure worth looking into it, but it was not one of the things I was focussed on.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Google it when you get done with me.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Because you'll find that it's having a devastating impact on human society and the globe, and the environmental impact is catastrophic.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: The industrial slaughter of animals for food?</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Yes. The looming threat of industrial pig, dairy and poultry farms to -- anyway --</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Got you.</p><p>IMUS: This -- I can just tell now.</p><p>MCCORD: You can stop now.</p><p>IMUS: You've got a sausage burger in one hand and a bacon sandwich -- so now tell me about your column this morning, what's going on in Afghanistan.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, the point I was trying to make, Don, is simple that, you know, George Bush approached Afghanistan -- just to simplify it was to say, you know, let's keep things there to a bare minimum. You know, we'll keep Karzai in power, we really don't care what he and his cronies do to rip off the country. Just let our troops operate there and focus on tracking down al Qaeda guys in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and keeping them off balance.</p><p>And it was a very kind of realist or near-realist approach. You know, what matters is really our interests, tracking down these guys. We really don't care whether Afghanistan is a well-run country or a poorly-run country. That's an exaggeration, but that was the core approach.</p><p>Basically, what happened, though, was that Karzai's misgovernance reached such industrial proportions, that tens of thousands of Afghans turned away from him and said, you know, we actually prefer the Taliban back compared to these guys. And that was kind of when Obama came onto the scene.</p><p>Now, you remember during the campaign, Obama really criticized the Bush administration on Iraq and Afghanistan for focussing on values and whatnot, and not our core interests. But basically what Obama has done is flipped it, and his whole policy in Afghanistan is predicated on the point of we have got to clear the Taliban out, then once we do that, we've actually got to deliver good governance to the Afghan people. And only by doing that will they restore their allegiance to the government, join the army, and allow us to get out of Afghanistan without having to worry of al Qaeda coming back.</p><p>So, the thing I was pointing out was simply two things. One is, it's really interesting that Obama's now really pursuing a much more idealist, as opposed to sort of hard-core realist, foreign policy in Afghanistan and, by definition, in Iraq. And the corollary to that is -- you know, a lot of people criticize Obama for getting in Karzai's face about his corruption, to which I say, you know, you can't get in his face enough, especially if this is your policy. So, that was really what I was trying to point out.</p><p>IMUS: But if this is the Obama policy, then this is the dictionary definition of nation-building, isn't it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Oh, yes. This is -- call it nation-building, Don, call it state-building, but that's exactly what it is.</p><p>And, you know, I think you and I talked right after the policy was announced. And the point I made is that, you know, the policy only works if a few things happen. One is if Obama actually does what he's saying he isn't doing, state-building, and if Pakistan really becomes a much more different country and takes on the Taliban inside.</p><p>You know, I think to Obama's credit, one thing that's happened -- and the reason people are feeling a lot better about Afghanistan, say, today than three or four months ago, is Pakistan really has taken on the Taliban inside and clearly shared a lot of intelligence with us. So, our Special Operations people and CIA people have been able to track down and eliminate or capture a lot of key Taliban leaders, and that's gone a little better.</p><p>Whether the situation on the ground, whether we can deliver -- you know, General McChrystal in Afghanistan -- I think he's a terrific guy -- calls it government in a box, which is basically, we clear out the Taliban and then we come, actually, with a box full of, metaphorically speaking, Afghan officials, and they provide good governance. That's what they tried in the first town they cleared, in Marjah. The next big test is Kandahar.</p><p>I think the jury is still really out whether that governance is delivering, but that is the strategy we've got in place. And I really was trying to write and then explain to people, that's what's at stake here. If that's what we're doing, this is what you better be rooting for -- one, better governance; and two, if Obama wants to get in Karzai's face, that's just fine with me.</p><p>IMUS: My head kind of was spinning though as I was watching Bob Schieffer on \"Face the Nation\" when Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates were on and Schieffer said, well -- talking about Karzai -- he said, well, now he's been characterized by you all as a drug addict and a thug, and this and that. Well, they just scoffed at that and said, oh, no, he's -- so the line changed -- oh, no, he's terrific, and he's coming over and bringing these new capes and all that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, I don't quite buy it, Don.</p><p>IMUS: What was that all about?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I mean, Karzai is both the -- to me, the cause of the surge and the beneficiary of the surge. He's the cause of the surge because it was his misgovernance that allowed the Taliban to come back, and he's going to be the beneficiary of the surge.</p><p>But, basically, you know, it's the old story. If you owe the bank $1,00, that's your problem. If you owe them a million dollars, that's their problem.</p><p>He's the only horse we have to ride now. And therefore, these -- our senior officials simply are going to have to live with him. And to which, you know, I say OK, I understand that, I'm not naive about it, but don't let him take you hostage.</p><p>You know, he needs us just as much. And I just really resent that. When you want it more than they do, you always end up getting in trouble.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't see how -- even you acknowledge in your college this morning -- I don't see how this plan the president has for Afghanistan ever works. Ever.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: And this was my problem from the beginning, that, you know, it may work, Don, with infinite time and infinite money.</p><p>IMUS: But we don't have that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, we have neither. And so that's what really troubles me about it.</p><p>But my attitude has been, look, I made my point earlier, I'm skeptical of this. But my country is in it now. We're in the middle of it, so I'm just focussed on, all right, we're in the middle of it. How do we think this through rationally? How do we get it to work, if at all? Because we're in the middle of it, and so that's really what I'm trying to apply my gray matter to.</p><p>IMUS: Why are we being so icky to Netanyahu?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, you know, I think what all of that was about, Don, is a couple of things. And in a way, there's an analog with the Karzai story.</p><p>I think what, you know, sort of Biden's blast at Netanyahu for announcing, you know, this new settlement project in Jerusalem when he was there, it wasn't just about, you know, this moment and that perceived slap in the face when Biden had actually come over to kind of make up with the Israelis and put things right. It was really about 40 years of Israeli officials misleading -- I would say cheating -- themselves and the world by constantly building settlements in a way that I don't think is in their interest. I know it's not in our interest.</p><p>And I think that Obama was really reflecting the anger of a lot of secretaries of state, a lot of presidents, that, you know, guys, this has got to stop. Because if it doesn't stop, there's no way we can actually produce, you know, a peace process. But more importantly, how are you going to remain a Jewish state if you permanently devouring more and more of the West Bank and ultimately absorbing their Arab-Palestinian population.</p><p>And so I'm all for red lines. I said in my column then, I said this morning, friends don't let friends drive drunk. And to me, you know, we've had way too many American presidents just kind of tolerating with the Israelis are doing there, which is bad for us and bad for them.</p><p>And when the United States comes to Israel and says look, guys, we have 200,000 troops in the Middle East right now, in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're not there for you, they're there for us. But their being there, actually, certainly helps you. It wiped out one of your biggest enemies, Saddam Hussein.</p><p>So, when we come to you and ask you for the smallest favor, which is, like, don't build any more settlements right now while we try to get a peace process going, which we think would improve the atmosphere in the region and help our troops, there's only one right answer to that question, and that is, yes, Mr. United States, we will do that. Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: In the 20 years or so that you've been appearing on this program, as we often touch on this subject -- and the conversation never changes, just the people. It never changes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: It's funny, Don, you know, I think one of the very first times I was on your show, which is 20 years ago, I had written \"Beirut to Jerusalem.\"</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Which was my memoir of that time of the world. As our mutual agent Esther will tell you, the book is now about to reach its 20th year in paperback. And what happens when you have a paperback after 20 years, the license expires and it actually comes back to you.</p><p>And you cannot only sell the book, you can do whatever you want with it. So we're actually going to come out with a new edition in a year or so, and I've already decided it's going to have a new introduction. It's going to be one page, one line: \"Nothing has changed.\"</p><p>IMUS: You know, I know you didn't call up to be chastised by me, but I'm stunned that you can write a book on the environment and not assess the impact that our nation's food supply has on the way that these animals are treated, the way the food is prepared, the way it's presented, and the impact it has on not only the environment, but the health care of people in this country.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, there you go. I mean, I'm sure I missed a lot more than that, but I'm glad to know about it. And several people have written --</p><p>IMUS: This is an opportunity for you to get up to speed, isn't it, Tom?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I come on this show to be brought up to speed.</p><p>IMUS: In this case, you deserve it.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tom.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Don.</p><p>IMUS: Tom Friedman here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEE: Some breaking news this hour.</p><p>Apple delaying the international launch of the iPad. Fox Business the first to report to you that Apple is delaying the international launch of the iPad by one month due to strong demand.</p><p>That news driving the stock higher in the pre-market. And Apple saying the iPad has been a runaway success right here in the U.S. The company delivering more than a half-million iPads since its domestic launch. So we'll keep an eye on that stock today.</p><p>In the meantime, some economic news just in to us.</p><p>Inflation remaining tame in March. The Consumer Price Index rising by .1 of a percent, right in line with the estimate. When you take out food and energy, there's no change in prices compared to February, and this will likely allow the Fed to keep interest rates low.</p><p>We also got retail sales, up 1.6 percent in March, better than expected. A lot of that gain was due to strong auto sales. If you take out autos, you actually get the reading of .6 of a percent higher. That's also a bigger gain than economists were expecting.</p><p>And shares of JPMorgan rising in the pre-market as well after the bank reports better-than-expected earnings. It continues to see stabilization in delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. It's seeing broad-based improvements, and it's hopeful for a strong economic recovery. CEO Jamie Dimon says he doesn't know if regulators will allow JPMorgan to raise its dividends.</p><p>So we'll keep an eye on that stock.</p><p>Lots to keep an eye on this morning. Let's take a look at the European markets that picked up off that positive news from intel after the bell yesterday.</p><p>Trading higher this morning. As we take a look at our U.S. stock futures, we're seeing some green arrows on the screen as well. S&amp;P 500 up .4 of a percent.</p><p>And stay with us on Fox Business for \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Stuart Varney up at 9:20 Eastern Time.</p><p>In the meantime, you've got more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming to you next here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Six minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>That was probably the last time Friedman will be on, but -- I mean, that's crazy, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's a little oversight.</p><p>IMUS: It has a greater impact on the health of people in this country than anything. More devastating to the environment than anything. Than anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: And it wasn't on your radar?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, no, it wasn't on his radar. He had other elements of the problem. The sequel --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He's updating from Beirut to whatever it is. Maybe he can update his stupid environment book, Hot, Flat, and Corrupt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep it right here on the Fox Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments.</p><p>Then tonight at 6:00 Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, former New York City mayor Ed Koch. Ed Koch?</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, we'll be joined by Anthony Mason of CBS News, and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark. Oh God. And they've got two new books. Oh, that's great.</p><p>And then Jerry Springer is going to be here to talk about his new game show.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Paula Deen is a best-selling author and the host of the Food Network's show \"Paula's Home Cooking.\"</p><p>People love this woman.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: \"Paula's Party,\" \"Paula's Best Dishes.\" Her magazine, \"Cooking With Paula Deen,\" appears bimonthly. She's the author of \"Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cooking,\" \"Christmas With Paula Deen,\" a whole bunch of other books, all have been best-sellers.</p><p>She's been on everything. She's the founder of the Lady and Sons restaurant, co-owner of Uncle Bubba's Oyster House.</p><p>She lives with her family in Savannah, Georgia. Her new book from Simon &amp; Schuster is a coffee table book, beautiful, entitled \"Paula Deen: Savannah Style,\" Paula Deen and Brandon Branch.</p><p>Please welcome to the program, Paula Deen.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Deen.</p><p>PAULA DEEN, HOST, \"PAULA'S HOME COOKING\": Good morning, Imus. How are you?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine, baby. How are you?</p><p>DEEN: What an intro. And may I say, I have loved listening to you and watching you through the years.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you very much. I appreciate that.</p><p>DEEN: Oh, I have loved it. And thank you so much for having me on.</p><p>IMUS: So, you got rid of the husband.</p><p>DEEN: Got rid of the husband, yes.</p><p>IMUS: What did he do?</p><p>DEEN: I was married for 27 years, and I married -- I met and married my neighbor when I moved out on to Wilmington Island. And we've been together six years, and it's like we're just soul mates and --</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's good.</p><p>DEEN: It's just been a wonderful, wonderful life. My husband liked cold beer more than his desire for his family, I guess you might say.</p><p>And he adored us. He adored us, but he could never put down the alcohol. And, you know, I tried for 27 years to fix it and I couldn't, so I had to accept the fact that I could not change that.</p><p>IMUS: It ruins everything.</p><p>You know -- we're talking with Paula Deen. Her new book called \"Paula Deen: Savannah Style.\" It's a coffee table book. It is full of gorgeous photographs of how Paula and -- what's this guy's name, old Brandon?</p><p>DEEN: Brandon Branch.</p><p>IMUS: Old Brandon, who decorates these rooms. And man, you have to take your shoes off to walk into one of these rooms.</p><p>DEEN: Well, they're beautiful rooms. People -- Brandon and I, we tried to create a book that we could take people into these beautiful places, Imus, that when you come to Savannah you wouldn't ordinarily see.</p><p>You know, Savannah is made up of all kinds of magical, hidden gardens. And they're all behind walls, so you can't see them. So, this is our way of exposing people to these treasures.</p><p>IMUS: I like these songs you picked -- \"At Last,\" Etta James.</p><p>DEEN: That was the song that my husband and I danced to, the first dance after our wedding.</p><p>IMUS: Your new husband?</p><p>DEEN: My new husband, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, OK. Don't be picking songs --</p><p>DEEN: My for life husband.</p><p>IMUS: Don't be picking songs from the last one. We just got --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEEN: You know, I ain't a quitter, Imus. It just kills me to give up. And so, you know, I hung in there for 27 years. So I said if I could hang in for 27 years with him, I could do 50 very easy with the man I'm with now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's one of the great records ever, and I love Elvis and Joe Cocker.</p><p>DEEN: Yes!</p><p>IMUS: Billy Joel, Ray Charles, not bad.</p><p>DEEN: Yes, yes, yes, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's a pleasure to talk with you.</p><p>DEEN: Soulful music. Well, the pleasure is all mine, my darling.</p><p>Like I said, I've been a fan for years, so to actually speak to you is just another wonderful memory for me to have.</p><p>IMUS: I can see why people love you, because I love you.</p><p>DEEN: Well, thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Time now for an IMUS IN THE MORNING Fox Business update.

At least 400  people killed and many nor feared dead as the series of strong earthquakes  strike Western China.  Ten Thousand more are injured according to \"State  T.V.\" that's reporting many remained buried under ruble.  The initial quake  had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other strong after  shocks.  Charles McCord will have more on this story later in the show.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we're going to turn to your Fox Business Minute.  And some of your top  business stories of the day, JP Morgan will give Wall Street an initial  read on the big banks when it reports its first quarter numbers this  morning, at 7:00 eastern time.  The company is expected to post a profit of  $2.9 billion or 64 cents a share.  We're going to have that report for you  live as it breaks here on Fox Business.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overseas markets rising on a positive report from Intel.  That company  kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big way.  Shares  jumping as much as 4% after profit in the quarter nearly quadrupled.  Intel  says it got a lift from sales of new chips for computer servers.  That's  the type of purchases companies had been holding off on during the  recession.  </p><p>And, Toyota will stop selling its 2010 Lexus GX 460 after \"Consumer  Reports\" says people shouldn't buy it.  The company asking dealers to pull  the SUV until it can do its own test.  The magazine says the SUV has an  unusually high risk of rolling over.  This problem reportedly has to do  with the electronic stability control, not the brakes or the gas pedals.   They were part of that massive recall for Toyota.  Toyota shares traded  lower in yesterday's session state side.  </p><p>Here's a quick look at our European markets as we head into Wednesday's  session.  Again, picking up of that positive news from Intel and trading in  positive territory.  Our U.S. stock futures doing something similar this  morning also with some green arrows on the screen.    We'll show you those.   Right now, S&amp;P 500 up 2/10 of a percent.  \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" next for  you here on  the Fox Business Network.                 </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, FBN HOST:  You know what's making me sick?  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  What?</p><p>IMUS:  Green tea -- making me ill, so --    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm sorry about that.  I just --  </p><p>IMUS:  So, my wife says to me -- I love  her to death, believe me --  but she says, well this new stuff  that she is giving me that kills -- they  all kills cancer cells -- so far so good, you know, beats radiation or a  stupid operation.    </p><p>CHALES MCCORD, FBN NEWSCASTER:  OK.  Go on, make this a point.    </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  But she says this new stuff she's giving me, she said it's  detoxing your body.</p><p>MCCORD:  Very well.</p><p>IMUS:  And I'm thinking what is left to detox?   </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS:  I mean, what's left?  </p><p>MCCORD:  I know --</p><p>IMUS:  You know what I had for dinner?  An f-ing radish!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No wonder you're a grumpy man!    </p><p>IMUS:  I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  No wonder you're crank tan.</p><p>IMUS:  I had a radish!  </p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Oh, I'm full, thanks!  </p><p>MCCORD:  You look like an end of season corn husk.  You've got to  stop.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Ladies and gentlemen, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING.\"  </p><p>IMUS: all right, five minutes after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE  MORNING\" program on the radio around the country and on the Fox Business  Network.  Pretty good line-up this morning.  we'll start with Geraldo  Rivera.  He's coming up.  We'll check in his five favorite songs, Charles.   They are \"Me And Bobby Mcgee,\" Janice Joplin.  \"Love Me Tender,\" Elvis.   They sang all the Elvis songs last night on \"American Idol,\" which was a  mistake for most of them.  \"Girl From The North Country,\" Bob Dylan.   \"Dance With My Father,\" Luther Vandross, and the Bruce Springsteen song,  \"Streets of Philadelphia.\"</p><p>MCCORD:  All right.</p><p>IMUS:  And then David Kirby is coming up.  David Kirby is the author of  \"Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial Pig, Dairy, and Poultry  Farms to Humans and The Environment.  He's selling one book a day on  Amazon.   </p><p>MCCORD:  That is wrong.    </p><p>IMUS:  He can't get on any -- he can't get on Fox and Fiends.  He  can't get on \"The Today Show.\"  He can't get on anything.  And, do you know  why he can't?</p><p>MCCORD:  I suspect why --    </p><p>IMUS:  Because nobody wants to talk about it.  I was trying -- and I  don't want to talk about it.  I was talking to Lupica last night, and he  starts going (INAUDIBLE).  He wouldn't let me tell him about these factory  farms.  You know, there's -- nobody is railing against people -- I'm not at  least, people who eat meat or poultry.  I don't care what you eat.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Not at all!    </p><p>IMUS:  We raise cattle in New Mexico.  My friends are cattle ranchers.   That's not the point, but the way these animals are - well, you can't even  -- like there's a site -- what is this site, Charles.    </p><p>MCCORD:  There's a site called Farm Sanctuary, which is it's an outfit  that does rescues although it's a pittance because of the massive  dimensions of the problem, but they do some rescues of some of these  animals that are factory, you know, factory processed before they process  them, and the web site is -- shows both the farm sanctuary side and also  the concentrated animal feeding operations side. </p><p>IMUS:  Don't want to see it.  </p><p>MCCORD:  And --</p><p>IMUS:  And people in the morning are trying to have their bacon and eggs --</p><p>MCCORD:  Of course!</p><p>IMUS:  -- and sausage with egg and muffin and all that.  You don't want to  hear about it, so I don't blame you.    </p><p>MCCORD:  Particularly, if you look at the egg production process.    </p><p>IMUS:  Believe me, you just do not want to know, but I like Kirby, and  it's an important - you ought to read it.  You ought to know about it.    </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, you really should.  You really should.    </p><p>IMUS:  And, you know, there's a way to buy organic meat and to buy --  well, sort of.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And there's a way to -- well, there is and to eat animals, but  animals are like us.  They have -- I mean I've spent half \\my life with  horses.  I mean they -- and cattle.  They have emotions.  They --     </p><p>MCCORD:  They are just as complicated physical systems as we do.    </p><p>IMUS:  They feel pain.    </p><p>MCCORD:  They certainly do.    </p><p>IMUS:  They -- well, they are not a bunch of happy animals skipping  around old McDonald's farm going in and out of the red barn.  Did you know  that, Jenna?    </p><p>LEE:  Well, now I do.    </p><p>IMUS:  OK.</p><p>MCCORD:  Is ain't an oink, oink here and a cluck, cluck there.  </p><p>IMUS:  No.  Not a happy little pig oiking in the thing</p><p>MCCORD:  Here a cluck, there a cluck, everywhere. </p><p>IMUS:  No.    </p><p>MCCORD:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  So --</p><p>MCCORD:  Fuzzy-wuzzy was a bear. </p><p>IMUS:  That's what you have to look forward to in about an hour.    </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, it's something that you should know about.    </p><p>IMUS:  He's the guy who wrote \"Evidence of Harm,\" you know.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  You don't want to talk about that, either.  </p><p>MCCORD:  No, of course not]</p><p>IMUS:  But, so -- including, by the way, me.  But I will, because --  </p><p>MCCORD:  Animal lover.   </p><p>IMUS: I don't know why I'm willing to do it, I just am.  And then Tom  Friedman is coming up.  A good column he has in the paper this morning  about Op-Ed page of the \"New York Times\" about Iraq and Afghanistan.  How  he -- did you read it, Bernie?    </p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER:  I read some of it.  Yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  It's pretty good.    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Damn good.    </p><p>IMUS:  Well, it is --</p><p>MCCORD:  I'll take a look at it.</p><p>IMUS:  -- heretofore whenever we get involved with one of these  countries, we didn't care exactly what they did in the country and the cold  war as long as they lined up with us.  If we support some a despot, well  that was just --.    </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, it was, yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  But, now we're more idealistic, and we want to change the  culture of these countries.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  We want the people to be -- I mean it's just so insane.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Hearts and minds.    </p><p>IMUS:  You can't -- it's -- even Friedman this morning admits that  it's stupid.  So, all of that stuff is coming up.  Charles, what's the big  news?    </p><p>MCCORD:  The big news story is another bad earthquake in the  headlines, I-man.  This one in province in province in Western China, and  the death toll has risen -- the known death toll to at least 400 now.  </p><p>And there's a good news story out of Florida with the successful recovery  of this 11-year-old girl who has missing in swamps for some four days.</p><p>And the president of the United States saying the world is a more secure  place now, post-nuclear summit that they did actually achieve some things  there.   </p><p>IMUS:  We're having a guy on Friday, just one of full of surprise for  his book \"The Dead End.\" </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  About the arms race trade in the United States and Russia.  David  Hoffman is his name.  A spotlight on this whole, you know, what's really  going on with this whole nuc thing    </p><p>MCCORD:  Clarity to that --   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, more interesting than talking about torturing little pigs  and stuff.  Jenna you don't seem that happy to see any of us this morning.    </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEE:  I'm thrilled to see you.  How can you say such a thing?    </p><p>IMUS:  I don't know.  You just came in and well, here's a thing with  Jenna, so -- we love her to death, by the way.    </p><p>LEE:  Here's the thing with Jenna.  Yes?    </p><p>IMUS:  Is that we love her to death.  What's going on in business? </p><p>(LAUGHTER)   </p><p>MCCORD:  There you're done.   </p><p>LEE:  Very good.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  It's like, Wyatt says to me -- he's 11.  He just says,  \"You have to know when to shut up.  Just shut up.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)   </p><p>MCCORD:  Wise beyond his years!    </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Just be quiet.  So, in business news, Jenna?    </p><p>LEE:  He seems to know more about women than --</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes he does.</p><p>LEE:  -- some other people in the room.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>LEE:  Well, the markets are trading higher this morning.  We had a big tech  company last night.  Intel out with good numbers, and that helped the  market.  We're also going to get numbers from JP Morgan, a major investment  bank today, or I should say, just bank in general.  We're going to get  those numbers in about 45 minutes and will mean a lot to the markets.</p><p>In the meantime, AIG is trying to pay us back, still they are selling 53 of  their planes to a  major Australian investment bank for about $2 billion,  so that's going to come back to us and for all the  private plane users in  the room.  This is for you, specifically.  ABERCROMBIE &amp; Fitch is paying  their CEO not to use the private jet.  And if he goes over a certain  amount, he's going to have to pay.  So, they're paying him $4 million, just  in case he goes over the amounts and then he has to pay back the company.   </p><p>IMUS:  Certainly that's not directed at me, I can't imagine that.   </p><p>MCCORD:  No, it's the rest of us private jet users!    </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  I just don't understand why we're bringing the hurt to the I- man.  I just don't get that.  Speaking of bringing of hurts to the I-man,  Ronnie Deutsche --</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.  I love this.</p><p>IMUS:   -- who is this tax babe.  She -- I don't know.  I was just talking  about her yesterday.  This image I have of her at the end of the bar at  9:00 at night -- every night at the Blarney Stone with a pell-mell dangling  out of the corner of her mouth, hunched over a glass of Jack Daniels, you  know, who's going to be next.    </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  Shot and a beer chaser!    </p><p>IMUS:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS:  She says, \"Dear Imus, I am a cigar smoking woman, so I thought you  might enjoy my  favorite cigar\" -- and always a great thing to give a  cancer patient --</p><p>MCCORD:  Perfect!</p><p>IMUS:  Somebody with emphysema.  Anyway, enjoy -- this woman is so dumb.   It makes my -- actually it makes my toenails hurt.  \"Enjoy and happy tax  season.\"   </p><p>MCCORD:  There you go.    </p><p>IMUS:  Here's Ronnie, what you can do with this --    </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, no, no, no.    </p><p>IMUS:  Well, she's not dumb, and she's a nice lady, and here's the  cigar.    </p><p>MCCORD:  That's no good.</p><p>IMUS:  Nub using our Jackson.  Actually, do you smoke cigars?    </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  You don't?  How about nub?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I do!    </p><p>IMUS:  You can have this one.    </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Thank you.    </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  Anyway, Warner got sports.  He's coming up.  Jim Nantz all  over Tiger Woods, huh, Warner?    </p><p>WARNER WOLF, FBN SPORTSCASTER:  Oh, man, what happened? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I mean just --</p><p>WOLF:  Hey dawg!</p><p>IMUS:  Well, you know, Warner.  Somebody asked me, \"why is Warner  calling you dawg.\"  I said, \"Oh about a week ago, I said something, I  referred to him as dawg, what's going on.\"  And so now, Warner is doing  that.    </p><p>WOLF:  That's right.    </p><p>IMUS:  But he does it and nobody knows why.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF:  Well, I thought you were talking to Rob.   </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Well, Rob is great for doing that.  I'll make just some  offhand comment.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Sometimes even off the air, and Rob will write a bit about it,  assuming that everybody knows what we're talking about and of  course,  nobody does.  At any rate, -- well, Nantz is saying that if he would used  the kind of language Tiger Woods used that had got on CBS mics as Tiger  Woods did.  He'll be fired, and he's right about that.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And, two, as others have said, Lupica and you, Warner Wolf, and  Nantz, and that is the Tiger is going to use -- the Tiger says he's going  to try to do better than do better.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  If you're going to behave better, then behave better, which he did  not do, and as Nantz pointed out, if somebody offered him and said, well,  tiger had a camera in his face all day.  Nantz say \"well, so did Phil  Mickelson.\"</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Phil didn't say anything.  </p><p>WOLF:  No!</p><p>IMUS:  All Phil did was win.</p><p>WOLF:  That's it!</p><p>IMUS:  Which Tiger didn't do.</p><p>WOLF:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, he's right!</p><p>WOLF:  Nantz is absolutely right, and Tiger is the one that brought it up.  </p><p>IMUS:  And the Yankees won the home opener.    </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, they did.  Biggest crowd ever in the new stadium for a  regular season game. </p><p>IMUS:  Wow!</p><p>WOLF:  And there's a couple of good stories.  Bulls General Manager, John  Paxon, apparently challenged Bulls' coach Vinnie Delnegro to a fight.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO:  That great!</p><p>IMUS:  What happened?    </p><p>WOLF:  Well, we'll see what happens there, and the Bulls are  investigating.  Well, that looks like the story.  Ben Roethlisberger met  with NFL commissioner Goodell yesterday and faces possible suspension and  Beef Jerky has dropped their sponsorship for Big Ben's Beef Jerky giving  our beef a bad name.  And, Barry Bonds -- Barry bonds says, \"I'm proud of  Mark McGwire for admitting he used steroids.\"  Barry Bonds.   </p><p>IMUS:  And Bernie has a briefing sponsored by P.C. Richard and Son.   What's up, B?    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, first of all. President Obama is going to go to Poland  this weekend for the president's funeral, there.  The polish president died  in the air crash, which is a nice thing.  He said a lot of things about  President Obama, give up a weekend.  It's actually a nice gesture. </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And Conan O'Brien going to TBS.  He's pushing back George Lopez,  and there's a lot of talk about Lopez getting disked and getting the  ironically the Conan treatment from TBS.  Anyway, he had Chris Rock on the  show last night, and they were discussing just that.   </p><p>CHRIS ROCK, ARTIST (?):   Where are you going?    </p><p>CONAN O'BRIEN, TBS HOST (?):  I'm going to midnight.  He's coming on  11:00, and I'm going to midnight.    </p><p>ROCK:  Get the hell out of here!   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK:  So, you're going to move for the white man! -</p><p>O'BRIEN:  I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK:  I hope he appreciate this.    </p><p>O'BRIEN:  I think the white man does appreciate it very much.   </p><p>ROCK:  OK.  You go got to clean the park or nothing.    </p><p>O'BRIEN:  No, I got to go to work an hour later.  </p><p>ROCK:  OK.</p><p>O'BRIEN:  A dream come true.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I'm just glad Jimmie Norton didn't make those jokes but like  the politically incorrect humor.   </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  That was good, funny.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  That's from last night.    </p><p>IMUS:  Seventeen -- wheels just came off right there, didn't they,  Charles?    </p><p>MCCORD:  A little bit.    </p><p>IMUS:  Seventeen after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\"  program.  Give you time to get your bacon and sausage going and all that  and then we'll fire up \"Animal Factory\" and David Kirby in about an hour.   However, next is Geraldo Rivera.  This is one of his favorite songs, one of  mine, too.                                              </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS:  Are you looking for an investment opportunity, but you're not sure  where to start?

Time now for a  business update from the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.   </p><p>LEE:  Good morning, everybody.  Here's you're Fox Business Minute on  this Wednesday morning.  President Obama meeting with congressional leaders  from both parties at the White House today to talk about financial  regulation reform.  Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner saying, quote  \"republicans won't want to be on this wrong side of this.\"  But, Mitch  McConnell saying the democrats won't solve any problems and will provide  endless protection for banks.  </p><p>Big banks fighting against tough derivatives rules.  Goldman Sachs, JP  Morgan, and Morgan Stanley telling the senate agricultural committee.   Stricter rules will limit profits.  The committee chairman Blanche Lincoln  is expected to propose a more aggressive approach to sweeping changes to  the derivatives market.  </p><p>And, Fed Chief Ben Bernanke testifying on the Hill today to offer his  outlook for the economy.  Lawmakers on the joint economic committee will  likely question him about the strength of the recovery and also the pace of  job growth.  Fed officials have pledged to keep interest rates at record  lows for an extended period to boost spending.  Wall Street waiting to hear  if the Fed will move away from that commitments.  </p><p>All right, let's take a quick look at our futures here on a Wednesday  morning in positive -- well, positive territory ahead of JP Morgan's  numbers.  We expect those in a little more than half an hour.  Over to  Charles now for this morning's top stories.    </p><p>MCCORD:  And a couple of these stories that we're following this  morning, Jenna.  There's another bad earthquake in the headlines.  The  number of dead and injured from a strong earthquake Western China is  climbing.  </p><p>Chinese State Television saying at least 400 people had been killed, more  than 10,000 injured.  Rescue workers trying to dig trapped people out of  the rubble of collapsed mud and wood houses.  Scores of people gathering  out in the open areas searching for relatives, a scene we have seen too  much certainly of late.</p><p>Tea party movement having a homecoming of sports today.  Sarah Palin  scheduled to headline a rally in Boston.  The city from which tea party  supporters revolutionary spirit was born.  They figured it will be like  10,000 people or so to turn out.</p><p>Couple of the headlines as the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program continues for  you, right now, here on the Fox Business Network.                  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Twenty-four after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE  MORNING\" program on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business  Network.  Geraldo Rivera is coming up in just a couple of minutes here.  </p><p>And the David Kirby and his book, \"Animal Factory.\"  Charles and I were  talking about last night and we're talking about it this morning, and I  don't know what the solution is.  But it's certainly is worth discussing.   You know, but -- you know, people like John Stewart, you know I like. </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  And David Colbert -- or Steven Colbert and some of these other shows  that this would be a natural for -- Stewart is much as I like him.  He  won't beat up on anybody.  He won't talk about anything, unless it's safe.   I mean beating up Fox News or whatever it is or Glenn Beck, that's a safe  target for him.    </p><p>MCCORD:  Exactly.    </p><p>IMUS:  So -- but, putting somebody on or Colbert putting -- putting  David Kirby on with \"Animal Factory\" is not safe for them, and they don't  have -- I don't want to be too harsh here.  They won't do it.  They just  don't have the guts.  They're fighting and they don't want to know about  it, and they don't want somebody in a suit to tell them they can't do it.    </p><p>MCCORD:  It is certainly worth the conversation, the subject.   </p><p>IMUS:  But, people think well, then, you know, people like David Kirby  are screaming at you that you can't eat meat, but he's not saying that.  </p><p>MCCORD:  That is not -- at all.  </p><p>IMUS:  But there's certainly is far more humane way to go about this and it  will cost more.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  But, the amount of money saves in health care costs would be so  astronomical that it would be ridiculous, but that doesn't help the people  processing the meat and the poultry because they don't -- they costs them  more.    </p><p>MCCORD:  And as you said last night, it doesn't have to be done  overnight, but you can take a baby step here and there.    </p><p>IMUS:  It's already tedious, and we've only talked about it for a  minute ago.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  No not at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  Well, we want to --</p><p>IMUS:  Bernie already wants to kill him. </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS:  Well, that's me point.  Here's Warner with sports.  Good morning,  Warner.    </p><p>WOLF:  Good morning, I-man.  Baseball, 49,000, Yankees Home Opener  including George Steinbrenner.  Yankees almost blew a 5 up and lead held on  beat the Angels, 7 to 5.  They took Andy Pettitte out after 6 with a 5  nothing lead.  Jeter and Nick Johnson home run for the Yanks.  Here's the  call, Michael Kay, Yes Network.    </p><p>MICHAEL KAY, RADIO COMMENTATOR:  This was a hit to right field.  There  it goes.  See yeah!    </p><p>WOLF:  The biggest hand, Angels DH and former Yankee Hideki Matsui  hugged by his teammates receiving a standing-o, receiving his World Series  Ring.  However, as a joke, Derek Jeter gave Matsui a fake ring.   </p><p>DEREK JETER:  We knew he wouldn't be able to compare to it anyone  because he was on the other side.  So, knowing Matsui, he's probably proud  to get the bootleg one too, and then we get him the real one.    </p><p>WOLF:  And the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2.  Guess what, I-man?    </p><p>IMUS:  What a whacky team, huh?    </p><p>RUFINO:  Yes, crazy.    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Loose.    </p><p>RUFINO:  We replaced the ring and give him this one!    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Not so funny!    </p><p>RUFINO:  And then we gave him triple glass.   </p><p>WOLF:  You thought I was going to play the Japanese voice, right, I- man?    </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you never know.    </p><p>WOLF:  No.  I wouldn't do that to you.   </p><p>IMUS:  Of course you would!  </p><p>WOLF:  Me?  No!  By the way, the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2.  The  game was over in two hours and 11 minutes.  Whoa!  Mets lost, 56,000  Dodgers home opener.  Dodgers beat the backs, 9 to 5.  Manny Steroid Home  Run number 547.  The first pitch was thrown out by Will I-am of the  Black Eyed Peas.  And the anthem was sung by Leann Rimes.  Ben  Roethlisberger after his meeting here in New York with commissioner Goodell  said --  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you drunk, Warner? </p><p>WOLF:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  You sound drunk.   </p><p>RUFINO:  What you got there on the console there?    </p><p>WOLF:  Wait a minute, I though that -- I thought the wine wore off.   Wait a minute!    </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Come on, dawg!    </p><p>RUFINO:  This dawg is drunk!    </p><p>IMUS:  Here's a deal.  We got a press on, Warner.  We're begging you.    </p><p>WOLF:  Here's a great story.  According to eye witnesses, after the  Bull-Suns game two weeks ago, Bulls General  Manager, John Paxon charged  into the office of Bulls Coach Vinnie Delnegro.  Grabbed Delnegro by the  tie and poked him repeatedly in the chest because of Delnegro's use of joke  him Noah.  Paxon while being pulled off by the assistant, Bernie  Bickerstaff, challenged Delnegro to a fight.  However, Delnegro did not  retaliate knowing that the Bulls could void his contract.  Here is  Delnegro.    </p><p>VINNIE DELNEGRO, BULLS' COAH:  No comment on that.  Whatever happens  is between the organization, myself, and the people involved, you know,  that is our internal stuff.   </p><p>WOLF:  Aha!  So, the Bulls have hired lawyers to get more interviews  and see what happens.    </p><p>IMUS:  Twenty-nine after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\"  program.  Time for the Fox Business Network business report and here with  that is Dagen McDowell.  Good morning, Dagen.    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good morning, sir.    </p><p>IMUS:  So, I was talking to a friend of mine last night, and this  friend of min is Lupica.  He said, \"Dagen thinks that she's normal, though  she is interesting different.  I said, yes.  And you do, don't you?    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm not normal?    </p><p>IMUS:  No.    </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why not?    </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't know.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, why not?  Everybody gets their freak on in some way,  it's everybody else who thinks they are normal, you know?  I think I'm  normal.  Everybody has issues.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, don't you think, Charles she's normal.   </p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN:  I think she is, one of the more normal  people that I have ever met.  </p><p>IMUS:  She is?   </p><p>MCCORD:  She just has a couple of issues, she's more willing to  discuss them maybe, than the average person.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>MCCORD:  That's all.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  People don't south don't try and hide the crazy folks in  their family.  They trot them out.  That is a good time.  </p><p>IMUS:  What they've done in your case, which is fine with us.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  They date them.  </p><p>IMUS:  They marry them.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's shockingly enough I edit myself, pretty heavily.   </p><p>IMUS:  You do?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh, yes.   </p><p>MCCORD:  That's disturbing.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Well, it's like getting in the shoving matches with people on the  train, I mean.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, I didn't know -- I didn't touch anybody.  I got in his  face with my finger because he cursed at me.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know?   </p><p>MCCORD:  He can't be doing that.   </p><p>(ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  No, do not -- no no, no, no, no.  I got a whole treasure  trove...   </p><p>IMUS:  I brought my nuts to work here.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank goodness and have mercy on this planet that you got  some food.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  We were starting to wonder.  </p><p>IMUS:  You are such an idiot.   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  See they're in a bag.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  All right.  That is refreshing.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm going to start frisking you every morning to make sure  you've got some food.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  They look like even they were stomped on a bunch.  </p><p>IMUS:  This is a week's supply, Charles.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, it's a week supply, that's not for just a day to have  with a Martini?  Come on.  </p><p>IMUS:  And Dagen for the business news, Geraldo is standing by here.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Quickly, if a story has anything to do with money, let's  call it a business story.  On that note, Former New York Governor Eliot  Spitzer spent $100,000 on call girls.  Over a roughly two year period, this  is according to Peter Elkin's upcoming book, \"Rough Justice.\"  This is on  page six of \"The New York Post\" today about 20 appointments, with ten  escorts over at least two years, by my Math, that is about $5,000 a pop.   One escort told Peter Elkin, it was very business like, he was not one of  those people who I would have said, went out of their way to make me feel  lovely and nice like many did.   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  And you're a hooker.  What the hell.   </p><p>IMUS:  That is why he's paying you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you.</p><p>IMUS:  I mean, calm down...   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Thank you, if you are getting paid, that is all you get.   </p><p>IMUS:  We are not going over to trumps to buy a bunch of stuff!  It's  32 after the hour here on the IMUS IN the morning program.  Dagen McDowell  with the fox Business Network business report.  She'll be back, of course,  and so will Jenna.  It's one of Geraldo's favorite songs, we're way late  for him but we're playing his song, so, what's he care?  </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>Announcer:  Warning, some content may be unsuitable for mature  audiences.

And I guarantee they are talking about what time kfc  opens and they can get a double down.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Can I tell them what you just said?  Yo, are you talking  about where you will get lunch, like kfc, because again, if you don't want  the abuse, don't stand behind the camera, right?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Damn right.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, whatever, we wonder what they are doing, so.  They are not  paying attention to you, that is for sure, so.   </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  They are trying to ignore me, probably because I'm  liable to lock horns with them and just cause a big uproar in the middle of  the newsroom.                 </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  I'm eating a nut.  Well, the -- where's Geraldo?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  He is off the radar right now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Apparently his plane has not landed from Afghanistan, just yet.   He was supposed to have landed already, but some sort of delay.  </p><p>IMUS:  Is he coming back this morning or are you just jerking my  chain?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No, no.  I just spoke to the one and only Mrs. Rivera and  she was expecting -- he should have been walking through.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, that's fine.  OK.  The Addams -- man, I keep on coughing and  everything else.  The Addams family open on Broadway last Thursday.  And,  Jerry Zack is directing it but he was brought in, it was in Chicago, and  they brought him to New York and it needed to be fixed and so they brought  him and they fix it and they fixed it a little.  But here's the Ben  Brantley, here's the opening paragraph of the review from last Thursday,  Charles.  </p><p>\"Imagine if you dare the agonies of the talented people trapped inside the  collapsing tomb called the Addams family.  Being in this genuinely ghastly  musical, which opened Thursday night, at the Lunt-fontanne Theater, and  stars a shame fully squandered at Nathan lane and Bebe Neuwirth must feel  like going to a Halloween party in a straight jacket or a suit of armor.   Sure you make a flashy, if obvious first impression, but then you are stuck  in the darned thing for the rest of the night and it is really, really  uncomfortable.  You can barely move, and a strangled voice inside you keeps  gasping, help!  Get me out of here!\"   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  And not what the, not what the Addams family folks were  looking for, I don't think.  </p><p>IMUS:  The next -- last weekend they sold a million dollars worth of  tickets, you can't get a ticket, to it until the fall.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Wow! </p><p>IMUS:  So, it had a huge advance and the universally awful review.  </p><p>MCCORD:  That's a rough opening paragraph.  </p><p>IMUS:  Particularly from the times, the one that matters, you know?  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  So, it hasn't apparently hurt them.  I received an e-mail, from  the doctor wanting to know if I wanted to come and see it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  But I want to see million dollar quartet and American idiot,  before I see, OK.  I mean, I was going to Broadway season, it's going to be  -- it's going to be one musical after another.   </p><p>RUFINO:  Mr.  First Nighter.   </p><p>IMUS:  One or two would be about it, you know, so. </p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER:  I saw one last Sunday, I-man.</p><p>IMUS:  What did you see Warner?</p><p>WOLF:  It's called \"Enron,\" it's about the scandal, obviously.   </p><p>IMUS:  No kidding!   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF:  No, you know, it was over.  When the scandal -- I could never  understand what actually happened, but in the play, oh, you see what they  actually did.  Just, gosh stole the money on nothing and they sold the  stock and had nothing.  </p><p>IMUS:  Right.</p><p>WOLF:  It was pretty good.  I thought it was interesting.   </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, selling stock based on nothing was pretty good or the  musical, or it was the musical or just the play?  </p><p>WOLF:  No, although they.</p><p>IMUS:  Is it the musical or play?   </p><p>WOLF:  It's a play.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, it's a play.</p><p>WOLF:  But they do have music in it.   </p><p>IMUS:  Well, OK, that's a life that you have -- we need an  intervention.  I mean, if you have to go see a play based on the \"Enron  Scandal,' really, you need some help!   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  And a musical, that's kind of idiotic, why not sing songs about  it?  </p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER:  Here comes Enron.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  Dice Clay.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS DICE CLAY:  We have Dice Clay.  </p><p>IMUS:  What is Dice have?   </p><p>BARTLETT:  Dice says, the top eight most surprising revelations in  Kitty Kelly's Oprah book.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, why don't we do them?   </p><p>BARTLETT:  All right, then, I'm over here now, you know.  Number  eight: Stairs guys and dishes, she don't do any of them, oh!  </p><p>IMUS:  What is this again now?</p><p>BARTLETT:  The top eight most surprising revelations in Kitty Kelly's  Oprah book.   </p><p>IMUS:  OK.    </p><p>BARTLETT:  Number 8:  Stairs, guys and dishes, she don't do any of  them.  Number seven: Her low self-esteem is responsible for her weight  gains and her relationship with John Tesh, oh!  Number six: The lavish  gifts she sent to Diane Sawyer were just the ruse to get close to that  tasty albino hunk Mike Nichols, oh!  Number five: She once shot a man in  Reno just to watch him die.  Number four: She can belch the alphabet all  the way to the letter q.  Number three: She tried to sue the Grand Ole Opry  for copy write infringement.  Number two: She keeps Steadman around only  because Michael Jackson already bought the elephant man's bones, gee, gee,  gee, gee, gee, gee.  And then number one most surprising revelation in  Kitty Kelly's Oprah book, she paid $50,000 to the u.s. government to her  ass declared a national monument, oh!   </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Dice Clay here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  It is 16  until the hour, this is what you get when the guest doesn't show up.  This  portion of the imus in the morning program is sponsored by fair way market.   You two are particularly going to be interested in animal factory before  you go and get your double down at kfc today.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  That is when I stopped eating chicken, when I found out how  they processed it.  I mean, I don't want to discuss it now.   </p><p>MCCORD:  Can't, can't discuss it.  The details, no.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, but poor David Kirby, I mean, former \"New York Times\"  reporter.  He wrote \"Evidence of Harm\" which is a \"New York Times\" best- seller.  And he can't sell the Amazon -- Barnes &amp; Noble sells one book a  day of \"Animal Factory.\" </p><p>MCGUIRK:  I don't get it.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, you will get it, you want to know how your chicken is  processed?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  No.</p><p>BARTLETT:  I don't eat chicken.  </p><p>IMUS:  Beef.   </p><p>BARTLETT:  No.  I don't eat beef.   </p><p>IMUS:  Did you ever eat beef?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes, at one time.</p><p>IMUS:  OK.  You don't eat beef or chicken at all?   </p><p>BARTLETT:  No.   </p><p>IMUS:  You don't eat them, are you a vegetarian now?</p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  No, you are not.   </p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes.  I am, for the past month.   </p><p>IMUS:  You have been a vegetarian for the past month.   </p><p>BARTLETT:  Yes.  You have to start somewhere, I started a month ago.  </p><p>IMUS:  OK, how about you Tony?   </p><p>TONY POWELL, COMEDIAN:  I started this morning.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I started last night after visiting farmsanctuary.com.  </p><p>IMUS:  Don't you eat hamburgers and stuff, hot dogs?  </p><p>POWELL:  Yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  Can I ask you if you eat chicken.   </p><p>POWELL:  Yes.    </p><p>IMUS:  OK.  You want to know how it is processed?   </p><p>POWELL:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  No, you don't?</p><p>POWELL:  No, I don't, you know, I don't even want to know what happens  while it goes down -- when I swallow it.  I don't want to watch that,  either.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>POWELL:  I mean, why somebody would want to watch that?   </p><p>IMUS:  They don't.   </p><p>POWELL:  Exactly.   </p><p>IMUS:  But aren't you concerned that it is making you and the planet  sick?   </p><p>POWELL:  Oh, I'm concerned about that.  </p><p>IMUS:  Are you concerned that it tortures the little animals who feel  just as you and Rob? </p><p>POWELL:  Let me explain something about chickens.  A million some-odd  years ago, they were dinosaurs, billions of years ago, they were dinosaurs,  chickens are descended from dinosaurs, which means, that if we were here  with the chickens when they were dinosaurs, they would dinosaurs, they  would be eating me.  Do you think they'd be concerned about how I felt as  they tortured me?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD:  Very good answer.</p><p>RUFINO:  And that starts the power.</p><p>IMUS:  I can't argue with that.  Here's Dwight Yoakum.               </p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  And we have breaking news, at least  400 people killed and many more feared dead as the series of earthquakes  strikes Western China, 10,000 more are injured, according to state TV, this  reporting, also that many remain buried under rubble, the initial quake had  a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other strong aftershocks.   Charles McCord will have more on this story later in the show.  </p><p>All right.  Let's take a look at your \"FOX Business Minute.\"  </p><p>China once again saying, it will not respond to pressure to let its  currency strengthen.  This coming after President Obama told President Hu  that he hopes China will let the Yuan rise, the president saying, he had  quote, \"Frank discussions with him on the currency issue.\"  Mr. Obama  saying, a move for China towards a more market oriented approach is the  right one.  </p><p>Greece successfully raises $2 billion through a bond sale, the demand  for its bond is seen as a good sign that it is -- can keep raising money  without accepting a bailout that the interest rate of four and a half  percent is too high for the country to afford over the long term.  </p><p>And, get this one, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch paying its ceo to stop using  the corporate jet.  The company saying, it will pay for $200,000 worth of  flights for ceo Michael Jefferies each year.  After that, he has to pay the  company back, and to help him with that, Abercrombie giving him a $4  million lump sum.  Must be nice.  </p><p>That's a look at your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Taking a look at the European markets, this morning, up across the  board, about a half of percent in London on the CacQuarante in Paris, and  also, the Dax in Germany.  As for the u.s. futures board, also pointing  slightly higher, across the board.  </p><p>More imus in the morning coming up next.  </p><p>IMUS:  Seven minutes until the hour here on the imus in the morning  program, let's go behind the scenes at the Imus in the morning program, on  both radio and on the FOX Business Network.  How is it that this is the  only program, and it's not -- not the program isn't now bigger than it ever  was?   </p><p>MCCORD:  Right.   </p><p>IMUS:  On both radio and television, bigger than we ever were, how is  it that we book people, who don't appear?  How does that happen?   </p><p>MCCORD:  I just think they get to thinking about it.   </p><p>IMUS:  How did that -- you butt out.  How does that happen, Bernard?   </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Apparently Geraldo, his plane was delayed or something, is  the information we had, maybe we could ask Tom.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why, is it Tom's fault?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, no, no.  I mean, we went through the FOX bookers in  this case, so.  </p><p>TOM `BIGFOOT' BOWMAN, PROGRAM PRODUCER:  We normally go through the  Media Department here at FOX, so I think, actually what happened was there  was some mix-up with the days, and, they got it wrong.  </p><p>IMUS:  That would be important in booking a guest.</p><p>BOWMAN:  Booking the right day, yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Would get the day right.   </p><p>BOWMAN:  The date and the time, I think are two important elements,  sort of like headphones and a clock.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Knowing the way FOX runs, I can't believe it was their fault.   I mean, the Media Department, I can't believe that they screwed it up.  </p><p>BOWMAN:  Well, I'm not blaming it on the whole department, but I think  there was some confusion on their end.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, you're throwing the FOX Media Department under the bus.   </p><p>BOWMAN:  I'm not throwing the whole department under the bus.</p><p>IMUS:  It sounds to me like you are.</p><p>BOWMAN:  I'm just saying that there was a mix up with the day...   </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS:  No, you don't want to mix up with some big load sitting in the  control room.  That is where it was.   </p><p>BOWMAN:  I'm going to come down there and I'm going to whip up on you.   </p><p>IMUS:  Come on down, bitch, come on down...  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOWMAN:  Yes.</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Larry, how are you?   </p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS LARRY KING:  Elizabeth Taylor tweeting yesterday,  she's not engaged to her manager, Jason Winters, I guess she doesn't want  anyone to think she is off the market.  Because, you know, there are some  guys who believe that 300 pounds, 78-year-old husband in a wheelchair is a  catch.  I'm not surprised she's not engaged, I mean, this guy has got no  motivation to make it legal.  He's what's that old saying, he's milking the  cow for free.  Besides the age difference is prohibitive.  She's almost 30- years-older than him.  Her ovaries dried up before he even had a feather on  his schmigel (ph), what's in it for him?   </p><p>RUFINO:  Oh, Jesus!</p><p>IMUS:  I mean, I don't know if we need that kind of detail, do you Larry?  </p><p>BARTLETT:  What's in it for him?</p><p>IMUS:  I don't know.  </p><p>BARTLETT:  Besides the good parking spots, unless she still a goa, I mean,  I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating the olive loaf and as long as I  got the private duty nurse to push the wheelchair back in forth, it will be  a hell of a less work.  It wouldn't be the first time I took a safari  through her Velcro triangle.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Between Larry -- and Michael Jackson.  We were on the beach at Santro pay,  I was under the humumo (ph) for 45 minutes, nobody noticed a thing, because  that was back when she was looking like an Albino, Leon Sphinx, you could  have hidden a Volkswagen under there and nobody beginning to wise up.   Slick was in Alabama, the Yin Yang twins are a little scrappy, who's got  the most pranxious, your thoughts?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS:  Larry King here on the imus in the morning program.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Keep it right here on the FOX Business Network throughout the  day for the latest news and financial developments.  And tonight at 6:00  Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, Former New York City Mayor Ed  Koch.  Ed Koch.  Tomorrow on this program, we'll be joined by Anthony  Mason.  Cbs News and Mary Higgins Clark and they've got two new books.  </p><p>MCCORD:  That's great.  </p><p>IMUS:  And then, Jerry Springer will be here to talk about his new  game show.                  </p><p>ANNOUNCER:  IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  There's breaking news on Fox  Business: what appear to be better than expected results out of JPMorgan  for its first quarter are just in this morning, 74 cents a share, in  quarterly profits for the big bank.  That's 10 cents higher than the Wall  Street estimate, if those two numbers are comparable to each other.</p><p>The revenue results -- the sales results are also better than expected  more than $28 billion, when the Street was looking for $26 billion plus.   There is the JP Morgan stock price on the screen next to me, at $46.10 a  share, up from yesterday's close, of $45.87.</p><p>Among other things, JP Morgan led by its CEO Jamie Dimon saying it's  continuing to see its delinquencies stabilize and that the economy still  faces challenges, as the bank puts it this morning.</p><p>Now, the total profit for the quarter, the net income, was $3.3  billion dollars.  So, a $3.3 billion dollar profit for JP Morgan and what  it still described as a challenging economic environment.  But the company  does report profit that's better than expected by 10 cents a share -- 74  cents, versus 64 cents.</p><p>It'll certainly be a stock to watch today, it comes on the heels to  better than expected results last night from Intel.  We'll see if those two  put together able to put the stock market on a firm footing this morning.</p><p>Now, we have another piece of breaking news to get to this morning on  the housing market, that would be the latest mortgage applications figures  and those went down last week, the overall number, the headline figure was  down by more than nine percent.   One of the things we have been reporting  on here at Fox Business in recent weeks have been the rising of mortgage  rates.</p><p>So, fewer people applying for mortgages; 9.6 percent drop.  Now the  mortgage rates, the 30-year-fixed mortgage rate was up last week to around  5.3 percent.  It came down in the most recent week, a little bit; so  mortgage rates, after spiking up one week, now coming back down this week.</p><p>We are up on the futures, 32 on the DOW futures and more coverage of  this breaking news and all of the top headlines of the day straight ahead  as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  What's coming up, on \"Varney and  Company?\"</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\":  Well, you know, Roni  Deutsch, the tax lady.</p><p>IMUS:  I saw her on with Cavuto.  You know what I thought?  She will  not be doing my taxes, but I'm sure she's fine.</p><p>VARNEY:  Well, yesterday -- </p><p>IMUS:  I have this -- I have this image of Roni, every night around  9:00, she is down at the end of the bar there at the Blarney Stone --  (INAUDIBLE) big old gold glass of Jack Daniels, a Pall Mall hanging out of  the corner of her mouth, saying last night I did an Iraqi cab driver, I  hope I'll be lucky tonight.</p><p>VARNEY:  I like the way she comes on the commercial and says, \"I'm  Roni Deutsch\".  You know, I like that.</p><p>IMUS:  No if she's been around the block.  So -- </p><p>VARNEY:  Well, she's -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network  all over the world.  David Kirby, we've been talking about him all morning  and his book, \"Animal Factory\" coming up.</p><p>And Charles -- Charles and I are both stupefied, over a -- thanks --  over a -- the fact that Kirby can't get any traction with his book.  That  is a -- that's a major publisher.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He wrote a best-seller with \"Evidence of Harm\".  His new book  is called \"Animal Factory\".  Well, because nobody -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Nobody wants to hear.</p><p>IMUS:  Nobody wants to discuss it and I don't blame him.  So -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Give me my Jimmie Dean sausage and forget about it.</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  And so we cancel him or what?</p><p>IMUS:  No, we're going to talk it.</p><p>MCCORD:  No.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Oh.</p><p>IMUS:  He can't get on anyplace, he can get on here.  So you're not  going to see him on the \"Today Show\" or \"Good Morning America\" or \"Fox and  Fiends\", you just not -- you're not going to see him anywhere because they  don't want to talk about it and I don't blame him.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The I-man treads where no host -- </p><p>IMUS:  No, I just like him and I think the point is, when I found out  how they processed chicken I stopped eating it, before I stopped eating all  the stuff.  I mean, I couldn't do it and now -- and there is a -- there's  another way to do it.  Nobody is saying don't go to McDonald's, I'm not  saying that at all or anything even close to it.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  How about Burger King?</p><p>IMUS:  Fine.</p><p>MCCORD:  Sure.</p><p>IMUS:  But there's a -- and you can't do it overnight.  But, boy there  is a far more humane way to raise these animals and, to slaughter them than  what they're doing.  I mean, it is -- if you knew how what they were doing  it is horrific, that you can't -- Charles can't even tell me about it can  you.</p><p>MCCORD:  No, because I know how you worry you don't want to hear about  these things.</p><p>IMUS:  Like I can't watch scary movies?</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Deirdre and Wyatt watch them and I can't attend to it.</p><p>MCCORD:  Understood.</p><p>IMUS:  The violence, I can't stand it.</p><p>MCCORD:  So I'm not going to tell you about the baby chickens at the  grinder.  I just don't want to tell you about those kinds of things.</p><p>IMUS:  And chickens, the -- I tried to tell Lupica about it last night  and he starts screaming on the phone.  He said I don't want to hear about  it.  I said if your kids knew how these animals were treated they wouldn't  -- you wouldn't be sitting around the hotel there with a big old bucket of  chicken wings, you wouldn't do it, you just wouldn't.</p><p>Or -- or you -- or you would get some free range chickens and -- if  you could.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  You can eat them.  He just went -- I don't want to hear it.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  He's making chicken noises.</p><p>IMUS:  Making chicken noises.  He doesn't want to hear about it.</p><p>RUFINO:  No, no, no, no -- </p><p>IMUS:  Matt and Katie or Meredith, whoever is there now -- they're  going to -- </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, come on, no.</p><p>IMUS:  Are they're going to sit there and talk to David Kirby?  But  what is he nuts?  No, nobody is going to talk to him about it.</p><p>RUFINO:  Good morning, this is today, let's talk about slaughtering  animals.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, it's just -- </p><p>RUFINO:  Let's bring the calf right over here now, what's the weather  doing?</p><p>MCCORD:  We hear about the screams of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS:  I mean, you know.</p><p>RUFINO:  Let's bring Hannibal Lecter over here.</p><p>IMUS:  I didn't help myself -- I didn't help myself when I got in  trouble with this idiotic crusade I got into with -- over Thimerosal and  all of that.  So -- and this doesn't help, either, except that I'm more  reasonable about it than other people at my house.</p><p>What's the big -- and the other person in my house happens to be  right.  You have to do what you got to do.  What is the big news story,  Charles?</p><p>MCCORD:  The 6.9 magnitude earthquake in a province in western China  where it is known that at least 400 people have died and maybe 10,000 or  more hurt.  And the casualty count is expected to go higher, I-man.   They've had some aftershocks in the 5.2 range.</p><p>IMUS:  Aren't you going to China, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE:  I am, yes, I'm going on Saturday night, going to be there  next week to do some reporting in Shanghai and Beijing.  This is an awful  story, though.  This is the western part of the country.</p><p>MCCORD:  Right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  So, nowhere near there, but -- </p><p>IMUS:  Oh so then it's fine or not.</p><p>MCSHANE:  No, of course it's not.  That's not what I said, don't start  that, please.</p><p>MCCORD:  Why do you do that?  Why do you do that?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Off for a couple days and now we're going to start right  there, where we left off, which is -- </p><p>IMUS:  By the way we missed you.</p><p>MCSHANE:  No, you didn't.  You didn't miss -- no.</p><p>IMUS:  You're right.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  I just thought we'll get that straight and then we can  talk -- we actually have a lot of news.  And maybe you're not interested  but we have a lot of news -- </p><p>IMUS:  Well, if I was -- if I wasn't interested, why would I -- I  don't have to put you on.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Oh that's true.  You have plenty of options, you're right.</p><p>IMUS:  No, we love you.  We really do like you.  Well, what's going  on?</p><p>MCSHANE:  Well, JP Morgan just reported earnings, a minute ago I  talked about this on television but the -- the big bank led by Jamie Dimon  probably weathered the financial crisis better than anybody else.  It just  reported better than expected profits, made about $3 billion last quarter  which was more than they were expected to the stock price up in pre-market  trading.</p><p>So that will be something to watch.</p><p>And the other piece of breaking news we have is actually on the  housing market.  Fewer people applying for mortgages last week.  Mortgage  applications went down and the mortgage rate which we watch -- you know,  real people really care about, where the mortgage rate is it was 5.3  percent on the 30 year fixed mortgage last week it came down about 5.17  percent, if you are in the market for a new home.  There you go.</p><p>IMUS:  Connell McShane with business news throughout the hour here on  the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Those of you watching Fox Business will  notice that Connell has his power tie on this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Because Jenna showed up in the electric blue dress and somehow  you've got to deal with that.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's not easy.  It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh no, no.</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh you put that girl on television and then what are you going  to do?  How do you follow that?</p><p>MCSHANE:  It's an uphill battle but -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Warner has sports.  What's going on Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING:  All right, I-Man, the Yankees win  the opener and the Jays Ricky Romero lost a no hitter in the 8th inning.   Bulls General Manager John Paxson (ph) has challenge Bulls Coach Vinny Del  Negro to a fight.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces  possible suspension.  Beef Jerky dropped their sponsorship for  Roethlisberger.</p><p>And hooray for Jim Nantz for speaking out against Tiger Woods  behavior.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Jimbo.</p><p>WOLF:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He had Nantz from downtown.</p><p>MCCORD:  Damn right.</p><p>IMUS:  -- showing some guts.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>WOLF:  Hole in one.</p><p>IMUS:  Good for him.  So kicking Tiger, one Tiger is down, when it is  safe to do so.  So how come Nantz wasn't saying anything about Tiger, which  doesn't know anything about -- about his vile language, and the way he  treated fans and everybody else, when he was winning?   Where was Nantz  then?</p><p>WOLF:  I don't know.</p><p>IMUS:  Do you know where Nantz was, where was he?  He was -- he was  carrying the company's water.  That's what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  One of the Tiger -- pre-scandal.</p><p>IMUS:  Exactly.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  Exactly.  So -- now it's safe, let's jump on him.  Which is why  David Kirby can't get on anything.  He can't get on -- you think Jon  Stewart, or everybody knows (INAUDIBLE) I like a lot.  And, same with  Colbert, why can't you -- and this would be -- this is perfect for them.</p><p>MCCORD:  I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS:  You know why he can't get on there?</p><p>MCCORD:  Why?</p><p>IMUS:  Because they have no guts.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Well, because they want ratings.</p><p>IMUS:  And they want ratings.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Because they want people to watch.</p><p>MCCORD:  They don't want to drive the audience away.</p><p>IMUS:  The Bernie Briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son, 100 year.</p><p>MCCORD:  There you go Bernie.</p><p>IMUS:  What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Former Congressman Eric Massa from New York, who recently  resigned over, you know, the tickle party sex scandal and all of that  stuff, a male aide is actually suing him right now for sexual harassment.   They said the guy -- that the Congressman groped and propositioned him and  other male staffers, routinely made gestures that he wanted oral sex and it  also came out, that in early February --  </p><p>IMUS:  I've done that.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Yes, that's nothing new but this is really ugly right here.</p><p>MCCORD:  Leave me alone.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  He was at a service for a dead Marine in upstate New York  and afterwards they were at a Knights of Columbus Hall and he was trying to  pick up the bartender at the somber, solemn occasion, was this Eric Massa.   Imagine serving on board a ship with this animal, for -- </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  -- and he's in the Navy for like 20 years and reverend,  former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, he's getting, he's catching a  little heat for something.  He gave an interview to a New Jersey College  and a wide ranging interview but among the topics, some of it was a gay  marriage.</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  And he said that you don't go ahead and accommodate every  behavior pattern that is against the ideal.  There are some people who  believe incest so should we accommodate them?  Others believe in polygamy,  should we accommodate them?  Then he went on to say, \"We should act in the  best interest of children, not in the seaming interest of the adults.   Children are not puppies.\"  He'll catch a little heat for that.  But he's - - that's his position.</p><p>IMUS:  What's he saying about the puppies?  And hurt the puppies?   Charles?</p><p>MCCORD:  I don't know.</p><p>IMUS:  What are you saying?</p><p>Thirteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>MCCORD:  I don't know.</p><p>IMUS:  I don't get that, Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  They are not pets.  Kids are for life.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Let me tell you about Chamonix.  Want to get rid of  the fine lines on your face?

Just  came out at the top of the hour, better than expected, it's helping to  drive the stock up in the pre-market by more than 2 percent.  The financial  giant reporting a profit of 74 cents a share; it's well ahead of the 64  cents the Street was expecting.</p><p>And revenue was also ahead of expectations; the revenue number came in  at $28.17 billion.  The estimate was just over $26 billion.  So, better  than forecast for JPMorgan, which says the total firm-wide credit reserves  of more than $39 billion is 5.5 percent of total loans.  And the firm says  it continues to see its delinquencies stabilize.</p><p>Now as for the total assets under custody at JPMorgan, more than $15  trillion in the quarter; that is up by 13 percent.  And it says it extended  more than $2 billion in small business credit during the quarter, a lot of  question about small business lending.</p><p>And CEO Jamie Dimon says his company continues to contribute to the  economic recovery of small businesses and communities.  He says, \"Building  on the efforts of the Obama administration, JPMorgan has expanded its own  efforts to support small business.\"  Dimon also saying that efforts to  prevent foreclosures have produced what he described as significant  results.</p><p>There is the JPMorgan stock, $46.70.</p><p>Now let's go to the futures real quick.  Ahead of the trading session  on Wall Street with this earnings report in, and the one last night from  Intel better than expected, futures pointing higher as we head to Charles  for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD:  Ok Connell.  And the headline this morning the earthquake in  China, the far western area, 6.9, remote region of the Tibetan Plateau in  Qinghai province and they're figuring at least 400 people have died.  Maybe  10,000 or so injured and they anticipate those figures will go up.</p><p>And the President ending the nuclear summit in Washington on an optimistic  note.  News conference said more than 45 world leaders have made progress  and added that what they accomplished there will make this planet a safer  place.</p><p>Those are a couple of the headline stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program continues for you right now here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS:  (INAUDIBLE) Billboard for George Thurgood and Buddy Guy, last  summer out in -- appearing at one of the casinos out in Albuquerque, and  man, how would you like to be in that dressing room with Buddy Guy?  </p><p>MCCORD:  If you can survive it.  </p><p>IMUS:  Twenty minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING  program.  I just received an e-mail, I ordinarily never check this until  around 8:00.  </p><p>RUFINO:  What?  Almost never check your e-mails?</p><p>IMUS:  Until around 8:00.  </p><p>RUFINO:  That's a good one.  </p><p>IMUS:  And Ester says -- the literary agent over at ICM, who now has a  (INAUDIBLE) -- she holds the record as world's shortest person -- she wants  to hear about the chickens.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, she does want to hear it.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  She's the one.  </p><p>IMUS:  Wants to hear about the chickens.  Before you go get this  double-down over there at KFC, so.  But there is a humane way to raise and  slaughter chickens, right?</p><p>MCCORD:  That is the whole thing that we're trying to get to, is that  there is a better way of doing it.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  But it's not efficient.  </p><p>MCCORD:  But it's not efficient and it's going to cost money.  You are  absolutely right.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I don't want to spend $25 on a double down, I want to spend  $5.  </p><p>IMUS:  Don't you have -- do you have any pets, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I do.  </p><p>IMUS:  Ok.  What do you have?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Miniature Schnauzer.  </p><p>IMUS:  And how would you feel if the animal were tortured like they  torture the chickens and the pigs and the cows -- all those other animals.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  I would get violent.  I love that dog.  </p><p>IMUS:  Ok.  Then that's the point.  That is our only point.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  But I don't know the chickens.  </p><p>MCCORD:  The chicken is a stranger.</p><p>RUFINO:  It comes on his plate.  </p><p>IMUS:  What do you mean you don't know the chicken?</p><p>MCGUIRK:  The chickens aren't there when I come home wagging their  tails, saying, \"Hey, happy to see you.\"  </p><p>MCCORD:  They would be if they were there.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, they would.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  They'd be running around like peacocks, strutting their  stuff, ignoring me.  They wouldn't be as loving as the little pup.</p><p>IMUS:  Cows can be.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Can they?  </p><p>IMUS:  Of course, absolutely.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Absolutely.  </p><p>IMUS:  They have feelings just like you do.  </p><p>MCCORD:  And pigs can certainly be.  </p><p>IMUS:  Pigs can be a -- can make a great pet.  Or back in the '80s, a  date.</p><p>RUFINO:  And they can be loving.  </p><p>IMUS:  Or if you are Tiger, now.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  What the hell is going on out at that ranch?  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway.  It's time for a little sports and here with that is  Warner Wolf.  Sports is sponsored by Peerless Boilers.  They make America's  best boiler, 96 percent efficient PureFire.  You all get one and stick it  in your basement.</p><p>Good morning, Warner.  </p><p>WOLF:  Good morning I-man.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger met here in New York with Commissioner Roger  Goodell.  Prediction: a 2- or 3-game suspension by either the Steelers or  the NFL without pay the start of the season.  </p><p>IMUS:  It ought to be the whole season.  </p><p>WOLF:  That is too long.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, it's not.</p><p>WOLF:  Unless -- </p><p>IMUS:  Not too long for that girl.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Not if it was your daughter.  </p><p>WOLF:  That's a good point.  </p><p>IMUS:  If it was my daughter he wouldn't have played football again.</p><p>WOLF:  Meanwhile a beef jerky has dropped the sponsorship of  Roethlisberger, Big Ben's Beef Jerky saying he gives beef jerky bad name.</p><p>You remember West Virginia coach Rick Rodriguez.  Remember he abruptly  left the Mountaineers, just before the Fiesta Bowl to go to (INAUDIBLE) --  you remember that?</p><p>IMUS:  Sure.</p><p>WOLF:  Well, there may have been a good reason.  NCAA investigators  are now looking into possible rules violations while Rodriguez was head  coach.</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, darn.</p><p>WOLF:  And to make it worse, Michigan is also under investigation  where he's 3-and 9 and 5-7.</p><p>Baseball Jays Ricky Romero, had a no hitter broken up in the 8th  inning while beating the White Sox, their only hit.</p><p>Here was Romero's wife, Ricky Romero's wife who wondered if his close  call to history would go to his head.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I'm not even cold yet and Ricky is lining up  girls to take my place -- </p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF:  And finally -- how about that -- and finally, my time is up.

Time for the Fox Business Network  business report and here with that is Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, sir.  </p><p>IMUS:  How are you?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm good.  </p><p>IMUS:  What's going on?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Let's talk about Toyota and namely Lexus.  Toyota has  temporarily halted sales of that Lexus SUV that Consumer Reports yesterday  morning said \"do not buy\".  This is the Lexus GX 460.  And, for people  watching on TV, we're watching video from Consumer Reports.  And, tight  turns, the vehicle apparently fish-tails, and there is the possibility of a  rollover.</p><p>Now a Lexus spokesman telling \"The Wall Street Journal\" engineers in  the U.S. and Japan are working to reproduce the test.  Hope to determine  the cause of this by the end of the week and it could be tires.  It could  be suspension, could be shocks.  It could be as simple as just  reprogramming the stability control.  </p><p>IMUS:  Where is Rollo -- not Rollo -- What is his name?</p><p>RUFINO:  Jasper.</p><p>IMUS:  What is your husband's name?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jonas.  </p><p>IMUS:  Where is he this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  He's probably getting up and getting ready to walk the dog  right now.  Why?</p><p>IMUS:  I just wondered.  Listen to the way she asks that.  Why.  I  just wondered where he was.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Why are you asking me that?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Why do you wonder where my husband is at 7:30 a.m.?  That  maybe he left the house last night, after a little spat.  Maybe the -- You  know, maybe he's not there.  That he's out gallivanting around somewhere.   I don't know.  What are you implying?</p><p>IMUS:  Did you have a spat last night?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Life is a big spat, isn't it?</p><p>IMUS:  Did you see that Warner?  How her eyes shifted.  </p><p>WOLF:  Yes, I-man.  She's lying.  </p><p>IMUS:  And, you didn't answer the question, yes or no.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I was being very difficult last night.  </p><p>IMUS:  You were?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  I can't imagine that.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Just fussing about just random stuff.  So I will reform my  ways and be a better wife today.  I hope.</p><p>IMUS:  I brought my assorted organic nuts in a bag this morning, these  are -- what I get to eat for the week.  </p><p>MCCORD:  You are going through them like, you know -- water through a  goose, for crying out loud.  What are you doing?  You're going to eat the  whole week's worth now?</p><p>IMUS:  Last night I had two radishes for dinner and a couple of  artichoke hearts.  </p><p>MCCORD:  The heavy meal.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You know, you are not setting a good example for  vegetarianism.  You're telling people you don't eat meat, don't chicken,  don't eat beat but then it makes you grumpy.  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm not telling people not to eat meat.  You're wrong about  that.  I have friends who are cattle ranchers.  I'm not saying that at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You're right.</p><p>IMUS:  I'm not saying don't eat chicken.  I am not saying that.  No.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  No.  Damn it.  </p><p>IMUS:  People don't have to do what I do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I misspoke.  I'm just saying that you are not setting the  best example.  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm obviously exaggerating.</p><p>MCGUIRK:  Clearly.</p><p>IMUS:  Clearly -- When I get home -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh really.  </p><p>IMUS:  I will get my -- chewed out, because that's what she says.  And  then Wyatt, the little parrot chimes in and says, \"I told you, mom.\"  And I  didn't really have a radish.  Nobody believes that, but she thinks they do.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I wasn't talking about that.</p><p>IMUS:  I hope he leaves you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm talking about how grumpy you are in the morning.</p><p>IMUS:  I'm sorry I said that.  I said I hope he leaves you but I  didn't mean that.  </p><p>MCCORD:  He's already gone.  </p><p>IMUS:  That was my anger.  That was my anger -- that was my cancer  talking.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Oh my word.  Oh, my word, that is terrible.  </p><p>IMUS:  I know.  I said I apologize.  What do you want me to do?  I'm  sorry.  I apologize.  Please accept -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You are asking a woman what you want to do, I can come up  with a whole list.  I have a brand new note pad right here, let me start  writing it down -- </p><p>IMUS:  We look forward to that, next hour.

The bank  reporting a better than expected earnings that we've been reporting on this  hour, seeing improving trends on consumer loans and mortgages, hopeful for  a strong economic recovery according to the CEO Jamie Dimon, 46.89.  </p><p>Now, let's run through the rest of your \"FOX Business Minute\" with  President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the  White House today talking about financial regulatory reform.  Treasury  Secretary Geithner saying, and this is a quote, \"Republicans won't want to  be on the wrong side of this.\" But Republican Mitch McConnell did say that  the Democrat's plan will not solve any problems and it will provide endless  protection for the banks.  </p><p>Big banks, meantime, are fighting against tough derivatives rules,  Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, all telling the Senate Agriculture  Committee stricter rules will limit their profits.  But committee chairman  Blanche Lincoln expected a propose (sic) a more aggressive approach with  sweeping changes to the derivatives market.  </p><p>And the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, testifying today on Capitol Hill  offering his outlook for the economy.  Lawmakers on the Joint Economic  Committee likely to question him about the strength of recovery and also  the pace of job growth.  Fed officials have pledged to keep interest rates  at record lows for what they describe as an extended period of time in  order to boost spending and Wall Street waiting to here if the Fed will at  anytime in the near future move away from that commitment to keep rates low  for an extended period.  </p><p>Futures this morning have been up ahead of the trading session on  Wall Street after JPMorgan's results this morning and Intel's last night.

You look like  you're choking.</p><p>MCCORD:  Well, it's pollen.  I think that's the problem.  </p><p>IMUS:  David Kirby who we've been talking about all morning, is a  \"Huffington Post\" contributor, that's too bad.  And author of the \"New York  Times\" best seller \"Evidence of Harm\" winner of the 2005 investigative  reporters' and editors' award for best book and finalist for the New York  Public Library Helen Bernstein Award for Excellence in Journalism.  He  lives over there in Brooklyn.  His new book is called \"Animal Factory:  The  Looming Threat of Industrial, Pig, Dairy and Poultry Farms to Human  Environment\" and nobody wants to read it.  </p><p>DAVID KIRBY, AUTHOR:  No-body.  </p><p>IMUS:  They're selling one book a day at Amazon.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Travesty.  </p><p>IMUS:  And it's a major publisher St.  Marten is not some chump  self-published deal, so -- please welcome to the program our old friend  David Kirby.  </p><p>Good morning, Mr.  Kirby.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Thanks Mr.  Imus, thanks for having me back on.  You know,  when I first -- when the book came out March 2 and started selling fairly  well, but right now not doing as good.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you can't get on any of these programs.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Not yet.  National broadcast and television has not really  responded.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, what, what in your head told you that \"Today Show\" or  FOX and fiends or \"Good Morning America\" wants to have you on to talk about  how they -- how meat's processed or poultry or pigs or that sort of thing?  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, you know, it's a topic that people don't want to face.   I mean, I would say my book is more than just a catalog of horrors.  It  does tell real stories about real people.  NPR online said it reads like a  thriller, the compared it to Upton Sinclair, BookList said it was  compelling...  </p><p>IMUS:  NPR sucks.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, NPR...  </p><p>IMUS:  Dreadful.  </p><p>KIRBY:  You know, I was scheduled to go on one of their shows and  they canceled me.</p><p>IMUS:  Well, of course they did.</p><p>KIRBY:  They said they were a little tired of the topic.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well no, they don't want to hear about the topic.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Nobody does.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, you sent a copy to the president and first lady.  What  did they -- and actually liked it.  What did they do?</p><p>KIRBY:  Have not heard back from anybody at the White House.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, no.  You know why the president and the first lady don't  want to talk about this?</p><p>KIRBY:  Why is that?</p><p>IMUS:  Or why the president doesn't care about how food is  processed?  Because every time you see them they got a hamburger in their  hand.  Every time you see the president and first lady they're at some  hamburger joint.  I mean, they've got -- my wife is saying that's got to be  -- I mean, you don't just snap snapshots of the president that are not  rehearsed or not at least planned.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, you know, I'd like to talk about the Obama's if I  could, because on one hand I wrote a piece for \"Washington Post\" online  outling what Obama had promised and this helped him win the Iowa caucuses  taking a stance against these factory farms and he was doing pretty well,  but then I wanted to ask myself a couple other questions after I wrote the  piece, for example, under the Bush administration we fed cattle to cattle  in three different ways, blood products are given to dairy cows as a  formula, we feed restaurant scraps to cattle and we feed, believe it or  not, chicken crap to cattle.  </p><p>Now, we feed cattle to chickens and when they eat that feed, it  spills into their litter.  We have so much litter, we can't spread it as  fertilizer so what do we do we feed it to our cows.  Now, Mrs.  Obama talks  about her organic garden and how children need eat healthy lunches and  everything, and they let the FDA permit the feeding of, starts with an \"S\"  and ends in \"hit\" to our children.  And if people think that's boring, then  there's not much I can do about it.</p><p>IMUS:  Let me say something to you and I'm going to speak quietly  and slowly.  The president, as every other politician who's ever run for  anything, says all kind of stuff when they're running.  They have no  intention of honoring what -- any pledge they made during the campaign,  none.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, if he were to honor...  </p><p>IMUS:  Name one who did.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, I can't.  </p><p>IMUS:  No, of course not.  And Obama's no different, doesn't make  him any worse or any better than anybody else.  As Matt Taibbi pointed out,  he's talked about a new -- for example, a new culture on Wall Street, The  day he got elected, not the day that he was sworn in, the day he got  elected, he called every crook he knew on Wall Street, Bob Rubin and Larry  Summers and Geithner and the rest of these clowns.</p><p>So no, they have no interest in this.  So, my question, and Charles  -- talking to Charles about this last night -- so, how do we get people --  because I (INAUDIBLE) talked to (INAUDIBLE), there's a smart guy.  You  can't get-- nobody wants to hear about this and they don't want to hear  about the horror stories about how this -- these products were processed.   So, my question for you is, is it possible to meet the demand, the  commercial demand for meat and poultry and all of that stuff in this  country, the McDonald's, KFC, in a more humane way, to raise the animals  more humanely, to slaughter them more humanely?  Is that possible?  </p><p>KIRBY:  Absolutely, we just need more farmers.  Two percent of the  population produces 100 percent of the food.  What if we doubled that?  We  have a jobs crisis in this country, why not let young people and young  families get into farming and make the rules more fair, get rid of the  subsidies for the grain that we feed these animals.  Put a ban on  antibiotic use unless you're treating a sick animal.  Make sure that  producers can get their animals to the market through humane and regional  processing plants.  We don't have any of those things in this country and  those are the types of things that Obama ran on.  </p><p>IMUS:  That sound like a generational thing, doesn't it?  </p><p>MCCORD:  But, can a family farm, a family farmer actually make  money, can they get by now.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Oh, absolutely.  Yes, grass fed, pasture fed...  </p><p>IMUS:  Who owns these factory farms?  Tyson chicken, those people?  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, they contract with individual farmers who own the debt  and the manure, the companies own the animals and they basically pay these  people to babysit the animals until they grow up.  </p><p>IMUS:  So the animals are raised, slaughtered this way because it's  cheaper to do?  Must be.  </p><p>KIRBY:  It's much cheaper and it's more profitable for the  companies.  The problem comes...  </p><p>IMUS:  And yet, on the other hand, it causes a catastrophic health  care cost.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Catastrophic, and I was not even aware how bad it is.  In  addition to feeding chicken crap it our cows, a brand new report that came  out on Friday, as bad reports always do, not getting a lot of coverage in  the media on residue program for cattle in this country and this is a USDA  document, and they said that the USDA, it's from the inspector general --  is not doing its job and they found in our beef drugs, heavy metals and  pesticides.  These all come from the factory farm setting.  </p><p>IMUS:  What are you eating, Bernard (ph)?  What are you having?  </p><p>MCCORD:  Eggs and bacon.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>IMUS:  And you're sitting there talking about feeding chicken crap  to chickens and cows and then you wonder why you can't get on any of these  programs?  What, have you lost your mind?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK).  </p><p>IMUS:  And he's over there, he's got his head phones off, I'm  looking at him and Bernard's a smart guy, he's got his head phones off and  eating bacon and eggs and Bernard reads everything.  Would you read \"Animal  Factory,\" Bernard.  </p><p>MCCORD:  No.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: I would give it a look.  </p><p>IMUS:  You would?  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  You know, I'm -- well, maybe it would go on the back  burner, I don't know I'm not sure.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why people -- I'm not sure I'd read it.  I mean, I'm trying  to get you to read it, but I have a really weak stomach (INAUDIBLE)...  </p><p>MCCORD:  No, I know you do.  </p><p>KIRBY:  But this is not, again, just about all the terrible things  that happen at these factory farms, it's about people who are defending  their communities, bringing in greater regulations and more enforcement and  promoting an alternative way of raising animals in this country in a way  that is humane and sustainable and can produce affording food that's  healthy.  </p><p>And again, if you're not interested in the pollution, if you're not  interested in the animal rights, if you're not interested in what's  happening to people who live near these facilities, this is a catalog of  horrors of the stuff that we put in the feed that these animals eat and the  residue that's left behind:  arsenic, copper, antibiotics, these can cues  nural toxicity, the can cause developmental delays, they can cause a whole  host of illnesses and this is in our food that we're feeding to our  children.  </p><p>MCCORD:  When they're spread on these acres of land, nothing they  have nothing else to do with the animal waste, the heavy metals,  particularly, go into the soil and remain there forever, they cannot being  removed.  </p><p>KIRBY:  I've seen crop land where you can't plant anything because  the hog waste has so much copper and zinc in it.  And copper in our beef is  a real problem.  And you know, I know this is, we're on a business channel  on the news, this is a massive business story and it's not getting  reported.  Swine flu...</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, you're not going to get -- do you think that Cavuto is  going to put you on?  What are you, crazy?  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, you know, I went on CNBC a while ago...</p><p>IMUS:  Oh, well they suck.</p><p>KIRBY:  ...about a year ago, because the swine flu, about a year ago  came out, I went on and they reported that this was hurting the hog  industry, it's cost the hog industry a billion dollars.  </p><p>IMUS:  And that's their angle.  If you tried to get on like Jon  Stewart or Colbert or any of those shows?  </p><p>KIRBY:  Yeah, I have.  Colbert had the same response as NPR and  Stewart we haven't heard back from.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, no...</p><p>KIRBY:  There's funny stuff in here.  I mean we have crap bubbles in  Indiana...</p><p>IMUS:  You're not going to get on those shows because they're not  going to whale on somebody unless it's safe to do that.  </p><p>MCCORD:  There you go.</p><p>IMUS:  And it's not safe to whale on factory farms and these huge  conglomerates, but -- and what we're saying, and what I think you're saying  is, and it sounds contradictory, but you're not saying don't eat meat or  don't eat poultry or any other...  </p><p>KIRBY:  Of course not.  </p><p>IMUS:  What you're saying is that we don't have a happy little pigs  and chickens and cows running around the old barnyard anymore, that's not  what's happening.  </p><p>KIRBY:  But we can go back to at least partially getting our food  from that way and I think eventually we're going to have to get rid of  these factory farms altogether because of these diseases, because of what's  in the food, because of things like swine flu and MRSA, it's very important  that people know where their food comes from.  </p><p>IMUS:  Not only the diseases that the animals contract, in fact,  Deidre told me that the 70 percent of the world's antibiotics are consumed  by animals.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Yes, they are.  In this country and farmers can go to the  feed store and buy...  </p><p>IMUS:  The other 30 percent, by the way, are consumed by me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You were saying?  </p><p>KIRBY:  They can go to the feed store and buy antibiotics without a  prescription, they can buy it by the barrel full.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I wish people would read your book, you know, \"Animal  Factory,\" I mean, it's wonderfully well written and researched and I know  you worked hard on it.  </p><p>MCCORD:  It's heart of the message that is so important in that  dadgum (ph) book is that alternatives exist.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Absolutely.  I mean, there is a positive message to this  whole story, it's that it doesn't have to be this way.  And it is changing.   Demand for organic food growth by 20 percent every year.  People are  starting to learn they don't want drugs and metals and pesticides in their  food especially for their children.  And by the way, I am going around the  country and in local markets the media has been very, very responsive and  very interested and I actually do a lot of interviews even here in New York  City I did WNYC and WOR radio...  </p><p>IMUS:  Yeah, but you got to get on something -- I mean, we can sell  books here, one of the few places, but you got to get -- you know,  you're  not getting on Oprah, she's the last, or she's a nice lady and all of that,  I suppose.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Certainly.  </p><p>IMUS:  But she's the last person on earth that's going to get on  this crusade.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, \"Oprah\" magazine did do a Q&amp;A with me in the April  issue, so that was helpful.  </p><p>IMUS:  Except for that.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>That's a step.  Good for Oprah on that one.</p><p>KIRBY:  There's a lot of money in advertising animal products and I  think the advertisers are concerned about this getting on, too, because  they're afraid when people find out where the food comes from they are  going to buy alternatives and alternatives are available.  </p><p>IMUS:  I mean, it doesn't have to happen overnight, but I come back  to, I mean, if I don't want it know about it, and I don't eat meat and I  don't eat fish or chicken (INAUDIBLE), and who does?  I mean, I talk to  people they don't want to know about it.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Why won't people acknowledge where their food comes from?   It just seems very important.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh no, I agree with you and Charles.  </p><p>KIRBY:  And you know, I can understand that.  When I see stories  about the nuclear proliferation, I get so scared...  </p><p>IMUS:  Charles goes down to the diner, there where he lives, that  big mansion he has out there.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yeah.  </p><p>IMUS:  And has a turkey club sandwich...  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes, I do.  You bet.  </p><p>IMUS:  But you don't know...</p><p>MCCORD:  But, I would rather know where it came from and that the  turkey was a happy little bird.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh.  And here is another thing.  </p><p>MCCORD:  What?  </p><p>IMUS:  Getting into parallel universe stuff here, also, and I  believe that you take on the karma of the tormented turkey.  </p><p>MCCORD:  I understand.  </p><p>IMUS:  The tormented tortured turkey.  </p><p>MCCORD:  That's why I'm miserable.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's force fed chicken feces.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh, god.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, if we have any listeners left this morning out there,  we could count them on one hand, but I hope, I hope we can sell this for  you.  I hope you can sell it.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Well, thanks, Don, I think it's an important story.  </p><p>IMUS:  Also, you ought to get a Pulitzer Prize for this.  I'm --  that's what you ought to get.  Of course, this, when \"Silent Spring,\"  Rachel Carson's book came out, nobody wanted to read it.  No one.  Nearly  ran around the country had no interest, they thought she was insane.  So,  same could be said for you.  We happen to know you are insane, and you're  right about that.  </p><p>KIRBY:  My next book is going to be on puppies or something.  </p><p>IMUS:  Anyway, David Kirby, buy the book this morning, I mean,  here's what you do, you buy the book and just put it on the coffee table  and somebody walks in say, well yeah, I read that.  \"Animal Factory,\" David  Kirby from St.  Martin's Press.  Go to BarnesAndNoble.com, go to Amazon, go  someplace, buy this thing.  Thanks, David.  </p><p>KIRBY:  Thanks, Don.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thanks for grossing us all out.  Twelve minutes till the  hour.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Breaking news for  you this morning.  At least 400 people killed and many more feared dead as  a series of earthquakes strikes western china, 10,000 more are injured,  according to state TV, that's reporting that many remained buried under the  rubble.  The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by  several other strong aftershocks.  Charles McCord will have more on this  story later in the show.  </p><p>Now for your \"FOX Business Minute.\" China, once again, saying it  will not respond to pressure to let the currency strengthen.  This coming  after President Obama told President Hu that he hopes China will let the  yuan rise.  The president saying he had, \"frank discussions\" with him on  the currency issue.  Mr.  Obama saying a move for China towards a more  marketed oriented approach is the right one.</p><p>Greece successfully raises $2 billion through a bond sale.  The  demand for its bond is seen as a good sign that it can keep raising money  without accepting a bailout, but the interest rate of 4-1/2 percent is too  high for the country to afford over the long-term.  </p><p>And get this, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch paying the CEO to stop using the  corporate jet.  The company saying it will pay the $200,000 worth of  flights for CEO Michael Jeffries each year, after that, he has to pay the  company back and to help him with that, Abercrombie is giving him a $4  million lump sum.  Not bad.  </p><p>That's a look at your European markets.  Next we're up across the  board as we head into the afternoon session both here in London on the FTSE  and across on the continent on the CAC quarante in Paris and the DAX in  Frankfurt, Germany, up 1/2 to 3/4 of a percent and we're also higher too on  the U.S. futures board.  The NASDAQ on back of Intel up 1/2 a percent on  pre-trade.  More IMUS IN THE MORNING coming up, next.  </p><p>IMUS:  It is seven minutes till the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  Karl, Karl Childers, from \"Sling Blade\" is here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  You know, Carl, this week my five favorite songs are all  Dwight Yoakam songs.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes sir, I noticed that.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  He was in the movie with you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes sir, he was.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  Did you like him?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  No, I didn't.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  Was he not nice to you?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He wasn't nice to me.  Well, not that boy,  wasn't nice to that woman.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  So, we were talking about killing chickens this morning.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  So.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I don't rightly like that all that much.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  Like what?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm a chicken lover.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, I know you are, literally.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, sir.  When I eat a chicken I make it smile.</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:   Oh, yes, sir.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  That probably is not an area that we -- that's a road I  didn't want to travel.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I'm sorry about that.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  Remember the time you told me you married a chicken.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  That's only 'cause I was embarrassed I was  having relations with it.  Um-hm.  </p><p>IMUS:  I learned that later, yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  In the bible not supposed to have relations  unless you're cleaving to another.  Um-hm.I wasn't cleaved to her.  Um-hm.   Just getting it.  Um-hm.</p><p>IMUS:  Five till the hour.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>Good morning Mr.  Schrieffer.  </p><p>BOB SHIEFFER, CBS NEWS:  Hey, good morning, Don.  </p><p>IMUS:  I apologize for being late, but...</p><p>SHIEFFER:  Well, that's quite all right.</p><p>IMUS:  So, what were you saying now, Bob, we played that back that - - those comments, I love those closing comments, as you know on \"Face the  Nation,\" but your comments about the pope, now we have a priest up in  Massachusetts, right, Charles.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Correct.  </p><p>IMUS:  Calling for the pope to resign.  Is it going to come to that?   </p><p>SHIEFFER:  Well, I would suppose not.  I thought about that.  I  mean, you know, when -- well, I don't know, I don't think so.  I don't  think he's going to resign, but you know, I'm always reluctant to criticize  somebody's religion or the church.  </p><p>I'm a great respecter of the Catholic Church.  I mean, they really  were the kind of the crucible, the place where knowledge and scholarship,  that's where it was all through the Dark Ages and so forth and the Catholic  Church, along with Judaism, is really where all our Western values came  from and we're the product of those values, but it's just heartbreaking to  see something like the church is going through right now and I mean,  basically what I said was that the church and its leaders have to put their  reason for being ahead of the survival of their leaders and right now, they  do not appear to be doing that and until they do, I think their church is  going to remain at risk.  </p><p>People will seek God in many ways, but never in a way that puts  their own children at risk and I think -- I think the church is at risk,  right now.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Keep is here on the FOX Business Network throughout the day  for the latest news and financial developments.  Then tonight at 6:00  Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, former New York City mayor,  Ed Koch.  Ed Koch.  Tomorrow on this program we'll be joined by Anthony  Mason, CBS News and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark.  Oh, god.  And they've  got two new books.  That's great.  And then Jerry Springer's going to be  here to talk about his new game show.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a  business update.  From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody.  Here's your \"Fox  Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of J.P. Morgan rising in the pre-market after the bank reports  better than expected numbers.  It continued to see stabilization in  delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages.  It's also seeing broad- based improvements and its hopeful for a strong economic recovery.  The  company expects to add 9,000 employees in the U.S. as we take a look at the  stock moving higher in the pre-market.  </p><p>Overseas markets rising on that and also some positive news from Intel last  night.  The company kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big  way.  Shares jumping as much as 4 percent after a profit in that quarter  nearly quadrupled.  Intel says it got a lift from sales of new chips for  computer servers.  That's the type of purchase companies have been holding  off on during the recession.  </p><p>And Toyota will stop selling its Lexus GX460 after \"Consumer Reports\"  saying people shouldn't buy it.  The company asking dealers to pull the SUV  until it can do its own tests.  The magazine says the SUV has an unusually  high risk of rolling over.  This problem reportedly has to do with the  electronic stability control, not the breaks or gas pedals that's related  to the massive recall for Toyota.  Toyota shares were trading lower  yesterday in the market.  </p><p>Also, some other breaking news this morning.  At least 400 people killed,  many more feared dead as a series of earthquakes rocks western China.  Ten  thousand more are injured according to state TV and local reports say many  remain buried under rubble.  The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and  was followed by several other very strong aftershocks.  Charles McCord will  have more on this story a little later on in the show.  </p><p>All right, a quick look at the markets, though, as we head into Wednesday's  session.  The European markets trading up and looking like they're gaining  some speed.  If we take a look at our U.S. stock futures, we have been  trading higher for most of the morning.  </p><p>You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING here on the Fox Business Network coming  to you next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  I asked Jenna a few minutes ago, I said, where's Connell?  Just  curious.  </p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Yes.  </p><p>IMUS: So she thinks that that means -- believe me, if we had our way about  it, we'd have Jenna here all the time.  </p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: We like -- Connell's fine, but, I mean, come on, we're not stupid.   So -- but immediately she cops an attitude.  So.  </p><p>MCCORD: What do you mean? </p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean she's    </p><p>MCCORD: I didn't hear the exchange.  </p><p>IMUS: She's very sensitive, aren't you?  </p><p>MCCORD: Oh.</p><p>LEE: Well, I told you specifically because you e-mailed me to tell Connell  hello.  And I said -- and it was ironic because Connell e-mailed me to tell  you hello.  And so what I said is that if you two want it exchange love  messages, you should e-mail each other directly.  </p><p>MCCORD: That's a good point.  </p><p>IMUS: No, no, you had e-mailed me -- by the way    </p><p>LEE: Complimenting you on a wonderful article in Crane's (ph) about you.  </p><p>IMUS: OK.  </p><p>LEE: That you asked me to read.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING. </p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program,  on the radio all over the country, on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>We're sitting here talking about -- with Carl Jeffers (ph) from Sling Blade  and Reverend Jesse Jackson about -- and Charles, Bernie and Lou and Jenna  and everybody else, about David Kirby's book, \"Animal Factory.\"  And  Charles just looked at me and he said, he's not going to get on anything  because look at the advertising on all of these programs, including ours.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: It's fast food, it's restaurants and pharmaceuticals.  </p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean you watch the evening news, it's all pharmaceuticals.  But the  difference is I'm -- and it makes my wife crazy, but I'm not anti-fast food  joints or the pharmaceutical industry.  Taking all the drugs that I've  taken in my life, why would I be? </p><p>MCCORD: Of course, you're a supporter.  </p><p>IMUS: I would be a huge supporter of that.  But McDonald's and Kentucky  Fried Chicken, to select a couple, are in   they don't care.  They'll do  whatever -- they'll do whatever they need to do to get you to buy the  stuff.  </p><p>MCCORD: To get you in that store.  </p><p>IMUS: When people said they wanted salads, McDonald's started serving  salads.  </p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: When they want healthier stuff, they start -- that's fine with them.   They don't care.  When people started woofing on fried chicken, Kentucky  Fried -- they started serving grilled chicken.  They doesn't care.  So if  you -- so if the public demands an end to these horrific conditions that  these animals are raised and slaughtered in, it will -- it's fine -- it  will be fine with McDonald's or it will be fine with KFC.  What do they  care?  </p><p>MCCORD: And the question I had, does that  </p><p>IMUS: And if it costs more, it will cost you more.  </p><p>MCCORD: The question I had, and is answered in Mr. Kirby's book, is that,  yes, there are alternatives that exist now.  </p><p>IMUS: But the money that everybody's going to save, including the country,  is on health care costs.</p><p>MCCORD: That's true.</p><p>IMUS: Which are astronomical because of the stuff that's making folks sick.   So, that's enough about it.  </p><p>Meanwhile --</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Not really.  </p><p>IMUS: And -- not really what? </p><p>MCCORD: Not really enough.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Please, elaborate.  </p><p>IMUS: And while we were talking to Kirby, Bernie was sitting there eating - - I love you, Bernie.  Bernie's sitting there eating bacon and eggs,  weren't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: And loving every second of it.  </p><p>MCCORD: Oh, you bet.  It's delicious.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.  And yet, if they treated your dog like they treated the pig  that made that bacon thing for you this morning, you'd murder the person  doing it, wouldn't you?  </p><p>MCGUIRK: I would.  I would indeed.  Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, bingo.  </p><p>What's the big news story, quake in China?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, that is the still breaking news of this hour is watching the  aftermath of this 6.8 magnitude earthquake in China.  And 400 people are  known to have died about, maybe as many as 10,000 are homeless and a lot of  those people are hurt and they expect that the casualty count will go  higher, I-man.  </p><p>And a good news story out of the state of Florida where that little girl,  11 years old, had been missing for four days in the swamp area near Winter  Spring.  Densely wooded and alligator infested and all like that.  And a  fella found her yesterday and she is safe.  </p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, thank God.  </p><p>Jenna's here.  And Connell was on last hour and he thinks that we like you  better than him.  Isn't that ridiculous?</p><p>LEE: That's hysterical.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, I mean it's just --</p><p>LEE: I know how much you like him.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, of course.  So, what's coming up in business?  </p><p>LEE: Well, the markets are headed higher this morning.  We did get some  positive results from JP Morgan that came out with their quarterly results  this morning.</p><p>We're also going to get some data in about 20 minutes on the consumer,  Consumer Price Index, which is going to tell us whether or not our dollar  is getting us more or less these days.  Also, retail sales are out and  that's going to be important to the market as well.</p><p>And speaking of shopping, interesting, last night, or yesterday, a very  important artifact of American history actually was bought at an auction.   This is the flight plan for Apollo 11, where Neil Armstrong, obviously, the  first man who walked on the moon.  And this flight plan had inscribed on  it, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" which is  actually what he said.  We often misquote him.  It sold for $152,000, that  flight plan.  </p><p>IMUS: Why did the flight plan have that written on it?  </p><p>LEE: Well, he -- I think he inscribed it afterwards, but  </p><p>IMUS: I wonder -- oh, he did?  </p><p>LEE: Yes, he wrote -- he wrote it on the flight plan.  And often we say,  you know, \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" </p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: That's actually not what he said.</p><p>IMUS: What did he say?  </p><p>LEE: He said, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"  </p><p>IMUS: He doesn't want to talk about it now, you know?</p><p>LEE: Yes.  Well, that's why I thought you'd be interested in it.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Probably no chance of getting him on the program, is there?  Well,  how do you know unless you ask?  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we'll effort the man.  </p><p>IMUS: Why don't do you that.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Sure.  We'll make amends.  He'll probably open up about his  walking on the moon now.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, no, we'll just see if he -- yes, I want him to tell me he  doesn't want to talk about it.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, you want to ambush the old hero.  </p><p>IMUS: Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: That's very nice.  </p><p>IMUS: That would be fun, don't you think?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes.  Definitely.  </p><p>IMUS: Jenna will be on throughout the hour.  Dagen McDowell is coming up.   Scott Salado (ph), our New York reporter, thinks that Dagen and her husband  had a big spat and that Rollo (ph) -- </p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: His name is not Rollo.  </p><p>MCCORD: No, not Rollo, no.  </p><p>IMUS: It's a -- </p><p>MCCORD: Jonas.  Jonas.</p><p>IMUS: Jonas left the house last night and was out stomping around in New  York.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, maybe walking over that gravel he spread last weekend.  We'll  find out.  </p><p>Sports coming up with Warner Wolf.  </p><p>The Yankees won their home opener, huh, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Yes, they did, I-man, and then handed out the  rings.  And Hideki Matsui, the ex-Yankee, got the biggest hand of all.   Bulls General Manager John Paxson apparently challenged Bull's Coach Vinny  Del Negro to a fight.  Dolphins get Bronco's all-pro wide receiver Brandon  Marshall.  Hurray for Jim Nantz for publicly criticizing Tiger Woods foul  language at The Masters.  And  </p><p>IMUS: Why wasn't Jim Nantz criticizing Tiger Woods' foul language when  Tiger was winning all those tournaments before he got into all that  trouble.  </p><p>WOLF: Ah-hah.</p><p>IMUS: See, I had no idea.  Lupica never told me.  Well, because I never  asked him.  But I had no idea that Tiger was as big a jerk as he is because  I used to talk about --</p><p>MCCORD: How much fun it was.  Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I -- I mean, I don't play golf.  I don't -- you know.  The  only thing I like about golf is the Great River Golf Club.  I get to drive  around in the cart for the Imus Ranch Golf Outing.  But other than that, I  </p><p>MCGUIRK: But you use to watch golf when Tiger played, right?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and cheer for Tiger not knowing that he was a jerk.  </p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But it was on TV.  He acted like a jerk publicly.  It's just that  everybody   </p><p>IMUS: Well, I never noticed any of that.  </p><p>WOLF: Nor did I.  </p><p>IMUS: And Warner's one of the premier sports casters in America and he  didn't notice it.  If Warner Wolf doesn't notice it, how am I supposed to?   I'm just a casual fan.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Got to wake the hell up then.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, you're right about that, but I didn't know that he was throwing  his clubs and swearing at people and being icky to the fans.  </p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: I had no idea.  Well, where was Nantz when all that was going on?  </p><p>WOLF: Conspiracy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was with you.  Sleeping.  </p><p>IMUS: So, now that it's safe to kick Tiger --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now he's kicking him.  That's weak.  Really, that is weak.  </p><p>WOLF: Yes.  Lame.  </p><p>IMUS: Nantz is -- I love Nantz, and he's a very good friend of mine, but  he's a pansy.  And he knows he is.  </p><p>WOLF: Well, maybe he's had enough.  That's it.  </p><p>IMUS: Maybe he has had enough.  </p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour.  Warner will have a bunch of sports.   Bernard McGuirk will have the \"Bernie Briefing\" sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp;  Son.  Fifty-seven gorgeous stories, 100 years.  Still run by the family.   If you know what I knew, you wouldn't buy anything any place else,  including a shirt.  Well, they don't sell shirts, but you know what I mean.  </p><p>MCCORD: But if they did.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>What's up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Miami basketball star all star game MVP -- Miami Heat, Dwyane  Wade.  </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was -- he was at a Manhattan club in the meat packing district  just recently and Carmine Gotti, remember from that stupid show, \"Growing  up Gotti,\" growing up snotty, whatever you want to call it.  He wanted  today meet Dwyane Wade and Dwyane said -- reportedly said, according to  \"The New York Post,\" \"there's no way I'm meeting the Gottis or having my  photo taken with them.\"  Anyway, he left.  Their bodyguards got into a  fight.  Carmine was upset.  And, but, anyway, good for Dwyane Wade.  He  didn't want to meet the little -- the punk who makes the kids -- the kids  on the Jersey shore look like the Brady Bunch.  </p><p>IMUS: Right.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: But -- and Conan O'Brien is pushing George Lopez's show on TBS.   By the way, did you know he had a show on TBS?  Did anybody know?</p><p>IMUS: I did, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: At 11 p.m.  </p><p>IMUS: Because I watch basketball, so.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right.  Well, it's being pushed back --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't watch basketball.  I watch Charles Barclay.  Different.   Yes, I knew.  Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, right, but it wasn't getting much traction.  So, anyways   </p><p>IMUS: Well, it got (ph) no traction.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: None at all.  And so Conan's coming in.  He's getting pushed back  to midnight.  People are saying  </p><p>IMUS: What? </p><p>MCGUIRK: He's getting -- Lopez is getting pushed back to midnight by Conan.  </p><p>IMUS: He is? </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, he is.  </p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Conan's 11:00 and now they're going to put Lopez on at midnight.   And some people are saying he's getting dissed.  He's getting the Conan  treatment.  The treatment that Conan got at NBC, he's getting now,  ironically, by Conan and TBS.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, the story that they're circulating is, that in order to close  the deal --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: George Lopez actually called Conan.  </p><p>MCCORD: He's good with all of that, yes.</p><p>IMUS: And talked him into doing this.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And is fine with all of it and all that.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, sure.  Right.  </p><p>IMUS: I mean    </p><p>MCGUIRK: But, anyway, Chris Rock and -- was on the Lopez tonight show last  night and they talked about it and here's a little piece of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE LOPEZ, \"THE GEORGE LOPEZ SHOW\": I think you're here on a good night.  </p><p>CHRIS ROCK: Yes.</p><p>LOPEZ: I couldn't think of a better guest to be here.</p><p>ROCK: There's no bad nights on \"The George Lopez Show.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That's funny.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOPEZ: But with Conan coming to TBS.</p><p>ROCK: Yes, yes.  Conan's coming?</p><p>LOPEZ: Yes.</p><p>ROCK: And where are you going?  </p><p>LOPEZ: I'm going -- I'm staying.  I'm going to midnight.  He's coming at  11:00 and I'm going to midnight.  </p><p>ROCK: Get the hell out of here.  So you're going to move for the white man,  huh? </p><p>LOPEZ: I am.  I am.  Hey  </p><p>ROCK: I hope he appreciates this.  </p><p>LOPEZ: I think the white man does appreciate it very much.  </p><p>ROCK: OK.  And you don't got to clean a park or nothing, right?  </p><p>LOPEZ: No.  </p><p>ROCK: OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: No.  And I get to go to work an hour later.</p><p>ROCK: OK.  OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: That's a Latino dream come true, to go to work later.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get the hell out of here!  Anyway, that happened last night.   Enjoying that politically incorrect humor is always refreshing.  And so  Lopez apparently cool with it and everybody's happy.  </p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Except the I-man.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean, it's fine.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Did you just eat a lemon or  </p><p>IMUS: No, they're just two unfunny schmucks.  No.  So, whatever.  </p><p>Here's Chuck with a little news.</p><p>Charles.  </p><p>MCCORD: At least 400 people dead, thousands injured, others buried beneath  the rubble after this series of strong earthquakes we reported in western  China.  The Tibetan plateau area.  Wood homes collapsed.  People in the  streets looking for safety, look for relatives.  The U.S. Geological Survey  said the main quake was 6.9 and there have been aftershocks in the 5.2  area.  </p><p>Then in India, police say a cyclone diminished thousands of huts, uprooted  trees in several villages in eastern India and at least 68 people are dead  as a result of that.  </p><p>And then the story out of Florida today.  The good news story.  The little  girl's voice on the 911 call, faint by cheerful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADIA BLOOM: Hi.  Hi.  Yes, I'm the girl that got lost.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And there you go.  That is 11-year-old Nadia Bloom.  </p><p>IMUS: How long was she missing? </p><p>MCCORD: Four days all alone out in an extraordinarily densely -- </p><p>IMUS: Oh my God.  Man.</p><p>MCCORD: Dense area of the swamp.  Took people three hours to carry her out  of the area.  And there was a fellow who was a member of her church who  said he actually did get a divinely inspired message of where this little  girl would be.  Went to there.  Fought his way through.  Actually had to go  through with machetes and found her alive and they got her out.  </p><p>IMUS: Here's the problem, Bernie, with the Chris Rock, George Lopez bit.   It actually was funny the first time I heard it.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.  </p><p>IMUS: So, and I just forgot to -- I just forgot to program myself --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: To pretend I hadn't heard it before.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, that was two hours ago.  </p><p>IMUS: It was two hours ago and, by the way, it's remarkable that I  remembered that it was on two hours ago.  Well, why wouldn't George Lopez,  who is, who can be funny, why -- why wouldn't he want this?  Why not? </p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, because, you know, he's not the -- he's not the man any  more.  He's not the alpha male at TBS.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but he wasn't going to be the man anyway.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, that's true.  I mean, in a sense, he should welcome it  because it's going to bring him some attention and maybe some ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because he was sort of floundering and faltering.  </p><p>IMUS: So it's good for everybody.  </p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour.  One of my five favorite Dwight Yoakam  songs of all time.   This was his first hit.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.  Time now for a business  update.  From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.  </p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody.  Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of JP Morgan rising in the pre-market after the bank reports better  than expected earnings.  JP Morgan continues to see stabilization and  delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages.  The company seeing broad- based improvements and is hopeful for a strong economic recovery.  CEO  Jamie Dimon says he does not know if regulators will allow the company to  boost the dividend now.  </p><p>President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the  White House today to talk about financial regulation reform.  Treasury  Secretary Geithner saying, quote, \"Republicans won't want to be on the  wrong side of this,\" but Republican Mitch McConnell saying the Democrat's  plan won't solve any problems and will provide endless protection for  banks.  </p><p>Big banks fighting against some tough derivative rules now.  Goldman Sachs,  JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley telling the Senate Agriculture Committee  stricter rules will limit profits.  The Agriculture Committee can submit a  different proposal for reform than the Banking Committee already has.  But  the committee chairman, Blanche Lincoln, is expected to propose a more  aggressive approach with sweeping changes to the derivatives market.  So  we'll watch that play out.</p><p>A quick look at futures now as we hand it over to Charles for this  morning's other top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And a developing story this morning.  The China earthquake.  China  struggling with the aftermath of a major quake.  This time a magnitude 6.9  jolt in the far western Tibetan plateau area.  Officials report at least  400 people dead, more than 10,000 injured.  And police are digging through  the rubble of homes.  There have been a number of aftershocks.  </p><p>Then, to India, where police say a cyclone demolished thousands of huts and  uprooted trees there.  Several villages involved in eastern India.  And  they say at least 68 people have died as a result of that.  </p><p>President Obama calling the commitments from the two day nuclear security  conference, Washington, at once bold and pragmatic, promising to follow up  on the results, including a progress summit in two years.  </p><p>And then, up to 10,000 people expected as Sarah Palin addresses another Tea  Party rally today.  This time, Boston.  Next to last event at a Tea Party  Express tour that wraps tomorrow in Washington.  </p><p>Those are some of the headlines stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program  continues right here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>IMUS: Twenty-four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE   I'm coughing as  nobody's taking a (INAUDIBLE) for me.  But, anyway, what would you do if I  died, just sit there? </p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: No, everybody's just --</p><p>MCCORD: No, that's when -- that's when --</p><p>IMUS: No, what would you do?  I'm kind of curious.</p><p>MCCORD: That's when the rockets (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>IMUS: What would you do?  If I suddenly keeled over dead, would you just  sit there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Dance.</p><p>MCCORD: Ad the confetti.</p><p>IMUS: And dead air.  I'm dead and there's dead air?  Is that what happens  for the rest of the morning? </p><p>MCCORD: Probably so.  </p><p>RUFINO: Knowing you, you'd wake up and go, this is what happens when I die.   This is what you'll get.</p><p>IMUS: I'm coughing and he just sits there.  All of them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It's a party in the USA.</p><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Robotic  Urology.  </p><p>RUFINO: I don't see him moving, Chuck.  </p><p>IMUS: So, we're talking about \"Animal Factory.\"  David Kerby's book from  St. Martins Press.  Bit time publisher, big time book.  The guy had a huge  \"New York Times\" best seller with \"Evidence of Harm,\" about Thimerosal in  these vaccines.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: \"Animal Factory.\"  What number is it at Barnes &amp; Noble, Bigfoot?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS SHOW: Barnes &amp; Noble right now, it's moving up.  It's  number 41,477.  </p><p>RUFINO: Yes.</p><p>BOWMAN: And on Amazon it's 10, 994.  So, I mean, the good news is, it can  only go up from here, right? </p><p>IMUS: Well, no, there are books that are lower than 41,000 on BNN and lower  than, of course, 10,000 on Amazon.  But -- </p><p>MCCORD: What about number 41,400 and what is it, 78 is?  One beneath it.  </p><p>RUFINO: How to cook a great steak.  </p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.  But, I mean, it's got to be -- </p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.  </p><p>IMUS: Warner, you eat meat, don't you? </p><p>WOLF: Yes.  Not that much, though.  A hamburger.  That's about it.  </p><p>IMUS: Do you care how the cow was raised or slaughtered for that burger? </p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Not at all?  </p><p>WOLF: No.  </p><p>IMUS: So you don't care about how the animals are treated? </p><p>WOLF: Well, sure, but I don't think about it when I order a hamburger.  </p><p>MCCORD: There you go.  That's --</p><p>IMUS: So that's -- but you do care about it.  </p><p>WOLF: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: You just don't think about it?</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, well, think about it next time.  Do you have -- do you have any  pets?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, two dogs.  Two Jack Russells.  </p><p>IMUS: Oh, really?  </p><p>WOLF: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: How would you feel if we treated your Jack Russells like they treat  these cows?  </p><p>WOLF: Terrible.</p><p>RUFINO: No, you lost.  </p><p>IMUS: Well, that's -- there's a better way to do it.  I'm saying, you can  still have your hamburger, but there's a better way to do it.  </p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't want to hear about it, do you?</p><p>RUFINO: No one wants --</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody --</p><p>RUFINO: Nobody wants to hear about how  </p><p>MCCORD: Nobody wants to hear about --</p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCGUIRK: Just want to get through the day.  </p><p>IMUS: So I'll just stop talking about it.  </p><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE) nothing left to eat.  Man.  Geez.  I want to eat  something, Warner (ph).  </p><p>IMUS: No, no, you can eat what I eat.  You can have a radish and this bag  of nuts.  That's what you can have.</p><p>RUFINO: What is that, the hungry man meal?</p><p>MCGUIRK: There's people starving in Haiti, for God's sakes.  </p><p>IMUS: And they're talking about how they need all these factory farms to  meet the food supply. They're not meeting the -- the food demands.  They're  not meeting the food demands.  There are 12 million kids in this country go  to bed hungry every night.  Could be more than that, actually.  Look at the  number of people around the world who are starving.  So they're not meeting  the food demand at all, are they?  Please.  God, please shut up.  I'm  begging you.  I'm even telling myself, just please shut up.  </p><p>RUFINO: Just let him go and he'll stop.  </p><p>IMUS: It's 27 after the hour.  We're already late for Tom Friedman.   Quickly, just give me the couple of big sports stories.  Then we'll go to  Dagen.  Then we'll get to Tom.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, we're hungry, come on.  </p><p>IMUS: Here's Warner.  </p><p>WOLF: All right.  Yankees win.  The Mets lost.  John Maine lasted only  three innings, seven hits, eight --</p><p>IMUS: And a -- let me have an extra sausage patty.  </p><p>RUFINO: Yes, come on, three more.  Pile it on.</p><p>WOLF: The Dolphins have just acquired Bronco's all pro wide receiver  Brandon Marshall.  And the big NBA story, two weeks ago, Bulls General  Manager John Paxson charged into the office of Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro,  grabbed him by the tie, poked him in the chest and challenged him to a  fight because of Del Negro's use of Joakim Noah, who had a bad foot.</p><p>And that's it.  On the tree tops.  </p><p>IMUS: All right.  Thank you very much, Warner.</p><p>Time for a little business news.  From Fox Business Network, here's Dagen  McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.  </p><p>IMUS: Poor Scott Salado thinks that you and your husband had this huge  fight and old Rollo was out there walking around in the yard, or Jonas, out  there walking around in the yard, tromping on the gravel he spread last  weekend.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I just spent the last hour trying to get him on the phone,  cell phone, not answering, house phone, not answering.  Finally got him on  the phone and then he refreshed my memory what the fight was about.  You  know what?  I was in the right, doggone it.  The dog smelled like skunk.   He didn't wan to get off his duff and wash him.  And then he sassed me.   So, there you go.  </p><p>IMUS: Who sassed you, Rollo?  </p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he sassed me.  Wouldn't wash the skunk smell off the dog and  then he sassed me.  Don't sass me.  And, by the way, everybody bitches and  moans about the wife, about the moods and she's so unpredictable.  But you  know what?  When the wife takes charge and gets stuff done and when  somebody's yapping on their cell phone on the train, it's the woman who  tells him to shut up.  Somebody cuts in line at the movie theater, it's the  woman who tells them, get at the back of the line, buddy!  You know what,  so, it's a trade-off, isn't it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.  Grow a pair.  </p><p>IMUS: I'm choking to death here --</p><p>RUFINO: I'm scared.</p><p>IMUS: And nobody's going to talk to you unless it's me, so --</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>IMUS: I've got to go.  I'm dying.  But, thank you.  </p><p>MCDOWELL: I worry about you, man.  </p><p>IMUS: Oh, do you have any business news? </p><p>MCGUIRK: That's one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you -- in 20 seconds, we're going to get retail sales and  consumer prices out.  That's what  </p><p>IMUS: You're God damn nuts.  That's -- here's -- what do you think?</p><p>MCCORD: You -- you -- well, why did you persist? </p><p>IMUS:  Well, because my idiot wife, she says, \"Well, then take nuts.\"  And  I've tried to tell her a million times, you can't eat nuts if you're on the  air.  You can't eat them.  </p><p>MCCORD:  No, because they're dry and they irritate your throat.  </p><p>What's the matter with you?  You know that.</p><p>IMUS:  Jesus Christ.</p><p>MCCORD:  And you're eating a week's worth of nuts in one setting.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Talk about role reversals here.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Oh my God.  </p><p>IMUS:  It's just ridiculous.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You want me to cut in and rescue you?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  OK.  Consumer prices were up .1 of a percent in March.  That's  as expected.  And the core is unchanged, which is a little bit lower than  expected.  So that's all good news.  If you're going out to go shopping at  the grocery store for any food --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Or nuts.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- or nuts -- I do worry about you, man.  Somebody pat you on  the back.  </p><p>IMUS:  That's fine.  .  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're worried about you touching you, actually.  </p><p>IMUS:  Charles would sit there and watch me die and just go -- and be  looking for the balloons to blow up.  </p><p>MCCORD:  That's it.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Tom Friedman is next.  </p><p>This is one of Tom Friedman's favorite songs.  I have no idea who it is or  what it is, and I don't care.  </p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>LEE:  All right, everybody.  We do have some breaking news now.  Dagen just  touched on it briefly.</p><p>The Consumer Price Index just in to us, a rise of .1 of a percent, the  headline number.  The core number, if you exclude those volatile food and  energy prices, is unchanged, similar to January, where we saw that  unchanged as well.  </p><p>We were taking a look and seeing whether gas prices really were a factor  here, and the number doesn't appear to be -- that was something we were  looking at, to see if maybe there was a jump in the Consumer Price Index.   It's something we were looking at as far as its factor in retail sales as  well.  </p><p>Retail sales are up 1.6 percent for March.  That's also a little bit higher  than expected.  We were looking at 1.2 percent as the rise.  </p><p>We have seen a drop in hourly wages, so we're taking a look to see if that  was going to affect retail in March, which has been a very unpredictable  month, in part because of the weather.  But again, up for March.</p><p>Also, a little bit higher when we take out motor vehicle sales.  The number  was up .6 of a percent.  That's a .1 of a percent higher than expected.   It's the largest jump in retail sales that we've seen since November of  2009.  </p><p>That's one of the headlines that's crossing at this time.  </p><p>If we can, let's go ahead -- oh, we're already there.  You beat me to it.  </p><p>A look at stock futures right now.  Take a look at -- oh, excuse me.  I'm  keep getting interrupted just because of some other breaking news at this  time.  </p><p>Apple just out with some breaking news, delaying the international launch  of the iPad.  We're going to take a look at some of the headlines that have  to do with that and bring more details to you throughout the morning.  </p><p>There's look at the stock again.  This news hitting just right now, that  Apple is postponing the international launch of the iPad by one month.   Demand, Apple says, is far higher than predicted.  </p><p>So we'll take a look at these headlines and be right back with more IMUS IN  THE MORNING.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  I don't know if I'm really interested in you and the producer of  \"The Jersey Boys\" trying to solve what's going on.  </p><p>BO DIETL, BO DIETL &amp; ASSOCIATES:  And Charlie Rose, one of the most  prolific interviewers of all time.  No, Charlie?  My man Charlie.  Well, in  any case-- </p><p>IMUS:  Charlie Rose, the guy on PBS?  </p><p>DIETL:  Yes.  </p><p>MCGUIRK:  The two legged Ambien pill.  </p><p>IMUS:  The two legged -- Bernie describes him right, the two-legged Ambien  pill.  </p><p>DIETL:  Oh, no.  He's a very smart man.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK:  He's on public TV for a reason.  </p><p>IMUS:  That bus left the station a long time ago.  That ship has sailed  years ago.  </p><p>DIETL:  We're talking about the economy.  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes, he is.  He's unlike me.  He will not be getting his mojo back.   That is not going to happen.  </p><p>DIETL:  He's right there.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)   </p><p>LEE:  Apple calling the iPad a runaway success.  That's what they're saying  this morning.  Let's take a look at the Apple stock, which is moving in the  pre-market on very strong volume on the news that Apple is delaying the  launch of its iPad internationally because it's saying that, really, it  can't keep up with demand.  </p><p>So we're keeping an eye on this stock, raising one percent in the pre- market.  Apple saying this morning that it has already delivered more than  a half-million iPads during this first week.  And again, it looks like  stronger demand that it is prepared for, delaying the launch of the iPad  internationally, and you can see the stock moving higher.  </p><p>Back to more IMUS IN THE MORNING now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the  country, on the Fox Business Network, on more radio stations, doing better  than we've ever done.  And why?  Because there's no God, that's why,  Charles.  </p><p>Please welcome from \"The New York Times\" a man who has one three Pulitzer  Prizes.  </p><p>MCCORD:  There you go.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tom Friedman.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Friedman.  </p><p>TOM FRIEDMAN, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\":  Hey.  Good morning, Don.  </p><p>IMUS:  You know, I was talking -- before we talk about your very fine  column this morning on idealism versus realism, and Iraq and Afghanistan,  if that's the proper way to describe it, when you wrote your green book,  what was that called, \"Hot, Flat, and --</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded.\"  </p><p>IMUS:  Did you write about these animal factories?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  No.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I don't know what you're talking about, Don.  Sorry.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, the animal factories are these huge, huge --  </p><p>MCCORD:  Huge installations that -- from which we derive almost all our  food supplies now so far as poultry and dairy and meat is concerned.  And  hundreds of thousands of animals are involved, many times in a single  place, and the way they're treated and the environmental consequences that  derive from that.  </p><p>IMUS:  The environmental impact, health care impact --   </p><p>MCCORD:  It's huge.  </p><p>IMUS:  -- is catastrophic.  And a friend of mine, David Kirby, who wrote  \"Evidence of Harm,\" which was about thimerosal in vaccines -- of course,  nobody wanted to talk about either --</p><p>MCCORD:  No.</p><p>IMUS:  -- has written this from St. Martin's Press.  And he can't -- I had  him on this morning, but he can't get -- nobody want to hear about it and  nobody wants to talk about it, including, apparently, you.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I'm sure it's important, and of all the different forms of  environmental degradation going on there, I'm sure it's really important.   It just was not on my radar screen.  Something I'm sure worth looking into  it, but it was not one of the things I was focussed on.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, Google it when you get done with me.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  OK.</p><p>IMUS:  Because you'll find that it's having a devastating impact on human  society and the globe, and the environmental impact is catastrophic.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  The industrial slaughter of animals for food?  </p><p>IMUS:  Yes.  Yes.  The looming threat of industrial pig, dairy and poultry  farms to -- anyway --  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Got you.  </p><p>IMUS:  This -- I can just tell now.  </p><p>MCCORD:  You can stop now.  </p><p>IMUS:  You've got a sausage burger in one hand and a bacon sandwich -- so  now tell me about your column this morning, what's going on in Afghanistan.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, the point I was trying to make, Don, is simple that, you  know, George Bush approached Afghanistan -- just to simplify it was to say,  you know, let's keep things there to a bare minimum.  You know, we'll keep  Karzai in power, we really don't care what he and his cronies do to rip off  the country.  Just let our troops operate there and focus on tracking down  al Qaeda guys in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and keeping them off balance.</p><p>And it was a very kind of realist or near-realist approach.  You know, what  matters is really our interests, tracking down these guys.  We really don't  care whether Afghanistan is a well-run country or a poorly-run country.   That's an exaggeration, but that was the core approach.</p><p>Basically, what happened, though, was that Karzai's misgovernance reached  such industrial proportions, that tens of thousands of Afghans turned away  from him and said, you know, we actually prefer the Taliban back compared  to these guys.  And that was kind of when Obama came onto the scene.  </p><p>Now, you remember during the campaign, Obama really criticized the Bush  administration on Iraq and Afghanistan for focussing on values and whatnot,  and not our core interests.  But basically what Obama has done is flipped  it, and his whole policy in Afghanistan is predicated on the point of we  have got to clear the Taliban out, then once we do that, we've actually got  to deliver good governance to the Afghan people.  And only by doing that  will they restore their allegiance to the government, join the army, and  allow us to get out of Afghanistan without having to worry of al Qaeda  coming back.  </p><p>So, the thing I was pointing out was simply two things.  One is, it's  really interesting that Obama's now really pursuing a much more idealist,  as opposed to sort of hard-core realist, foreign policy in Afghanistan and,  by definition, in Iraq.  And the corollary to that is -- you know, a lot of  people criticize Obama for getting in Karzai's face about his corruption,  to which I say, you know, you can't get in his face enough, especially if  this is your policy.  So, that was really what I was trying to point out.  </p><p>IMUS:  But if this is the Obama policy, then this is the dictionary  definition of nation-building, isn't it?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Oh, yes.  This is -- call it nation-building, Don, call it  state-building, but that's exactly what it is.</p><p>And, you know, I think you and I talked right after the policy was  announced.  And the point I made is that, you know, the policy only works  if a few things happen.  One is if Obama actually does what he's saying he  isn't doing, state-building, and if Pakistan really becomes a much more  different country and takes on the Taliban inside.</p><p>You know, I think to Obama's credit, one thing that's happened -- and the  reason people are feeling a lot better about Afghanistan, say, today than  three or four months ago, is Pakistan really has taken on the Taliban  inside and clearly shared a lot of intelligence with us.  So, our Special  Operations people and CIA people have been able to track down and eliminate  or capture a lot of key Taliban leaders, and that's gone a little better.  </p><p>Whether the situation on the ground, whether we can deliver -- you know,  General McChrystal in Afghanistan -- I think he's a terrific guy -- calls  it government in a box, which is basically, we clear out the Taliban and  then we come, actually, with a box full of, metaphorically speaking, Afghan  officials, and they provide good governance.  That's what they tried in the  first town they cleared, in Marjah.  The next big test is Kandahar.</p><p>I think the jury is still really out whether that governance is delivering,  but that is the strategy we've got in place.  And I really was trying to  write and then explain to people, that's what's at stake here.  If that's  what we're doing, this is what you better be rooting for -- one, better  governance; and two, if Obama wants to get in Karzai's face, that's just  fine with me.  </p><p>IMUS:  My head kind of was spinning though as I was watching Bob Schieffer  on \"Face the Nation\" when Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates were on and  Schieffer said, well -- talking about Karzai -- he said, well, now he's  been characterized by you all as a drug addict and a thug, and this and  that.  Well, they just scoffed at that and said, oh, no, he's -- so the  line changed -- oh, no, he's terrific, and he's coming over and bringing  these new capes and all that.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Yes, I don't quite buy it, Don.  </p><p>IMUS:  What was that all about?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I mean, Karzai is both the -- to me, the cause of the surge and  the beneficiary of the surge.  He's the cause of the surge because it was  his misgovernance that allowed the Taliban to come back, and he's going to  be the beneficiary of the surge.  </p><p>But, basically, you know, it's the old story.  If you owe the bank $1,00,  that's your problem.  If you owe them a million dollars, that's their  problem.  </p><p>He's the only horse we have to ride now.  And therefore, these -- our  senior officials simply are going to have to live with him.  And to which,  you know, I say OK, I understand that, I'm not naive about it, but don't  let him take you hostage.  </p><p>You know, he needs us just as much.  And I just really resent that.  When  you want it more than they do, you always end up getting in trouble.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, I don't see how -- even you acknowledge in your college this  morning -- I don't see how this plan the president has for Afghanistan ever  works.  Ever.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  And this was my problem from the beginning, that, you know, it  may work, Don, with infinite time and infinite money.</p><p>IMUS:  But we don't have that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Yes, we have neither.  And so that's what really troubles me  about it.</p><p>But my attitude has been, look, I made my point earlier, I'm skeptical of  this.  But my country is in it now.  We're in the middle of it, so I'm just  focussed on, all right, we're in the middle of it.  How do we think this  through rationally?  How do we get it to work, if at all?  Because we're in  the middle of it, and so that's really what I'm trying to apply my gray  matter to.  </p><p>IMUS:  Why are we being so icky to Netanyahu?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, you know, I think what all of that was about, Don, is a  couple of things.  And in a way, there's an analog with the Karzai story.  </p><p>I think what, you know, sort of Biden's blast at Netanyahu for announcing,  you know, this new settlement project in Jerusalem when he was there, it  wasn't just about, you know, this moment and that perceived slap in the  face when Biden had actually come over to kind of make up with the Israelis  and put things right.  It was really about 40 years of Israeli officials  misleading -- I would say cheating -- themselves and the world by  constantly building settlements in a way that I don't think is in their  interest.  I know it's not in our interest.</p><p>And I think that Obama was really reflecting the anger of a lot of  secretaries of state, a lot of presidents, that, you know, guys, this has  got to stop.  Because if it doesn't stop, there's no way we can actually  produce, you know, a peace process.  But more importantly, how are you  going to remain a Jewish state if you permanently devouring more and more  of the West Bank and ultimately absorbing their Arab-Palestinian  population.  </p><p>And so I'm all for red lines.  I said in my column then, I said this  morning, friends don't let friends drive drunk.  And to me, you know, we've  had way too many American presidents just kind of tolerating with the  Israelis are doing there, which is bad for us and bad for them.</p><p>And when the United States comes to Israel and says look, guys, we have  200,000 troops in the Middle East right now, in Iraq and Afghanistan,  they're not there for you, they're there for us.  But their being there,  actually, certainly helps you.  It wiped out one of your biggest enemies,  Saddam Hussein.</p><p>So, when we come to you and ask you for the smallest favor, which is, like,  don't build any more settlements right now while we try to get a peace  process going, which we think would improve the atmosphere in the region  and help our troops, there's only one right answer to that question, and  that is, yes, Mr. United States, we will do that.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>IMUS:  In the 20 years or so that you've been appearing on this program, as  we often touch on this subject -- and the conversation never changes, just  the people.  It never changes.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  It's funny, Don, you know, I think one of the very first times I  was on your show, which is 20 years ago, I had written \"Beirut to  Jerusalem.\"</p><p>IMUS:  Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Which was my memoir of that time of the world.  As our mutual  agent Esther will tell you, the book is now about to reach its 20th year in  paperback.  And what happens when you have a paperback after 20 years, the  license expires and it actually comes back to you.</p><p>And you cannot only sell the book, you can do whatever you want with it.   So we're actually going to come out with a new edition in a year or so, and  I've already decided it's going to have a new introduction.  It's going to  be one page, one line: \"Nothing has changed.\"</p><p>IMUS:  You know, I know you didn't call up to be chastised by me, but I'm  stunned that you can write a book on the environment and not assess the  impact that our nation's food supply has on the way that these animals are  treated, the way the food is prepared, the way it's presented, and the  impact it has on not only the environment, but the health care of people in  this country.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Well, there you go.  I mean, I'm sure I missed a lot more than  that, but I'm glad to know about it.  And several people have written -- </p><p>IMUS:  This is an opportunity for you to get up to speed, isn't it, Tom?  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Yes, absolutely.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  I come on this show to be brought up to speed.  </p><p>IMUS:  In this case, you deserve it.  </p><p>Thank you very much, Tom.  </p><p>FRIEDMAN:  Thanks, Don.  </p><p>IMUS:  Tom Friedman here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>LEE:  Some breaking news this hour.</p><p>Apple delaying the international launch of the iPad.  Fox Business the  first to report to you that Apple is delaying the international launch of  the iPad by one month due to strong demand.  </p><p>That news driving the stock higher in the pre-market.  And Apple saying the  iPad has been a runaway success right here in the U.S.  The company  delivering more than a half-million iPads since its domestic launch.  So  we'll keep an eye on that stock today.  </p><p>In the meantime, some economic news just in to us.</p><p>Inflation remaining tame in March.  The Consumer Price Index rising by .1  of a percent, right in line with the estimate.  When you take out food and  energy, there's no change in prices compared to February, and this will  likely allow the Fed to keep interest rates low.  </p><p>We also got retail sales, up 1.6 percent in March, better than expected.  A  lot of that gain was due to strong auto sales.  If you take out autos, you  actually get the reading of .6 of a percent higher.  That's also a bigger  gain than economists were expecting.</p><p>And shares of JPMorgan rising in the pre-market as well after the bank  reports better-than-expected earnings.  It continues to see stabilization  in delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages.  It's seeing broad-based  improvements, and it's hopeful for a strong economic recovery.  CEO Jamie  Dimon says he doesn't know if regulators will allow JPMorgan to raise its  dividends.  </p><p>So we'll keep an eye on that stock.</p><p>Lots to keep an eye on this morning.  Let's take a look at the European  markets that picked up off that positive news from intel after the bell  yesterday.</p><p>Trading higher this morning.  As we take a look at our U.S. stock futures,  we're seeing some green arrows on the screen as well.  S&amp;P 500 up .4 of a  percent.</p><p>And stay with us on Fox Business for \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Stuart Varney up  at 9:20 Eastern Time.  </p><p>In the meantime, you've got more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming to you next  here on the Fox Business Network.  </p><p>IMUS:  All right.  Six minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE  MORNING program.  </p><p>That was probably the last time Friedman will be on, but -- I mean, that's  crazy, isn't it?  </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, it's a little oversight.  </p><p>IMUS:  It has a greater impact on the health of people in this country than  anything.  More devastating to the environment than anything.  Than  anything.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  OK.  </p><p>IMUS:  And it wasn't on your radar?  </p><p>MCCORD:  Well, no, it wasn't on his radar.  He had other elements of the  problem.  The sequel -- </p><p>MCGUIRK:  Maybe.</p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  He's updating from Beirut to whatever it is.  Maybe he can update  his stupid environment book, Hot, Flat, and Corrupt. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Keep it right here on the Fox Business Network throughout the day  for the latest news and financial developments.</p><p>Then tonight at 6:00 Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, former  New York City mayor Ed Koch.  Ed Koch?</p><p>Tomorrow, on this program, we'll be joined by Anthony Mason of CBS News,  and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark.  Oh God.  And they've got two new books.   Oh, that's great.</p><p>And then Jerry Springer is going to be here to talk about his new game  show.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Paula Deen is a best-selling author and the host of the Food  Network's show \"Paula's Home Cooking.\"  </p><p>People love this woman.  </p><p>MCCORD:  Yes.</p><p>IMUS:  \"Paula's Party,\" \"Paula's Best Dishes.\"  Her magazine, \"Cooking With  Paula Deen,\" appears bimonthly.  She's the author of \"Paula Deen: It Ain't  All About the Cooking,\" \"Christmas With Paula Deen,\" a whole bunch of other  books, all have been best-sellers.</p><p>She's been on everything.  She's the founder of the Lady and Sons  restaurant, co-owner of Uncle Bubba's Oyster House.  </p><p>She lives with her family in Savannah, Georgia.  Her new book from Simon &amp;  Schuster is a coffee table book, beautiful, entitled \"Paula Deen: Savannah  Style,\" Paula Deen and Brandon Branch.</p><p>Please welcome to the program, Paula Deen.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Deen.  </p><p>PAULA DEEN, HOST, \"PAULA'S  HOME COOKING\":  Good morning, Imus.  How are  you?  </p><p>IMUS:  I'm fine, baby.  How are you?  </p><p>DEEN:  What an intro.  And may I say, I have loved listening to you and  watching you through the years.  </p><p>IMUS:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  </p><p>DEEN:  Oh, I have loved it.  And thank you so much for having me on.  </p><p>IMUS:  So, you got rid of the husband.  </p><p>DEEN:  Got rid of the husband, yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  What did he do?  </p><p>DEEN:  I was married for 27 years, and I married -- I met and married my  neighbor when I moved out on to Wilmington Island.  And we've been together  six years, and it's like we're just soul mates and -- </p><p>IMUS:  Well, that's good.  </p><p>DEEN:  It's just been a wonderful, wonderful life.  My husband liked cold  beer more than his desire for his family, I guess you might say.  </p><p>And he adored us.  He adored us, but he could never put down the alcohol.   And, you know, I tried for 27 years to fix it and I couldn't, so I had to  accept the fact that I could not change that.  </p><p>IMUS:  It ruins everything.  </p><p>You know -- we're talking with Paula Deen.  Her new book called \"Paula  Deen: Savannah Style.\"  It's a coffee table book.  It is full of gorgeous  photographs of how Paula and -- what's this guy's name, old Brandon?  </p><p>DEEN:  Brandon Branch.  </p><p>IMUS:  Old Brandon, who decorates these rooms.  And man, you have to take  your shoes off to walk into one of these rooms.  </p><p>DEEN:  Well, they're beautiful rooms.  People -- Brandon and I, we tried to  create a book that we could take people into these beautiful places, Imus,  that when you come to Savannah you wouldn't ordinarily see.</p><p>You know, Savannah is made up of all kinds of magical, hidden gardens.  And  they're all behind walls, so you can't see them.  So, this is our way of  exposing people to these treasures.  </p><p>IMUS:  I like these songs you picked -- \"At Last,\" Etta James.  </p><p>DEEN:  That was the song that my husband and I danced to, the first dance  after our wedding.  </p><p>IMUS:  Your new husband?  </p><p>DEEN:  My new husband, yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Oh, OK.  Don't be picking songs -- </p><p>DEEN:  My for life husband.  </p><p>IMUS:  Don't be picking songs from the last one.  We just got -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>DEEN:  You know, I ain't a quitter, Imus.  It just kills me to give up.   And so, you know, I hung in there for 27 years.  So I said if I could hang  in for 27 years with him, I could do 50 very easy with the man I'm with  now.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, that's one of the great records ever, and I love Elvis and Joe  Cocker.  </p><p>DEEN:  Yes!  </p><p>IMUS:  Billy Joel, Ray Charles, not bad.  </p><p>DEEN:  Yes, yes, yes, yes.  </p><p>IMUS:  Well, it's a pleasure to talk with you.  </p><p>DEEN:  Soulful music.  Well, the pleasure is all mine, my darling.  </p><p>Like I said, I've been a fan for years, so to actually speak to you is just  another wonderful memory for me to have.  </p><p>IMUS:  I can see why people love you, because I love you.  </p><p>DEEN:  Well, thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS:  Time now for an IMUS IN THE MORNING Fox Business update.

At least 400 people killed and many nor feared dead as the series of strong earthquakes strike Western China. Ten Thousand more are injured according to \"State T.V.\" that's reporting many remained buried under ruble. The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other strong after shocks. Charles McCord will have more on this story later in the show.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, we're going to turn to your Fox Business Minute. And some of your top business stories of the day, JP Morganwill give Wall Street an initial read on the big banks when it reports its first quarter numbers this morning, at 7:00 eastern time. The company is expected to post a profit of $2.9 billion or 64 cents a share. We're going to have that report for you live as it breaks here on Fox Business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Overseas markets rising on a positive report from Intel. That company kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big way. Shares jumping as much as 4% after profit in the quarter nearly quadrupled. Intel says it got a lift from sales of new chips for computer servers. That's the type of purchases companies had been holding off on during the recession.</p><p>And, Toyota will stop selling its 2010 Lexus GX 460 after \"Consumer Reports\" says people shouldn't buy it. The company asking dealers to pull the SUV until it can do its own test. The magazine says the SUV has an unusually high risk of rolling over. This problem reportedly has to do with the electronic stability control, not the brakes or the gas pedals. They were part of that massive recall for Toyota. Toyota shares traded lower in yesterday's session state side.</p><p>Here's a quick look at our European markets as we head into Wednesday's session. Again, picking up of that positive news from Intel and trading in positive territory. Our U.S. stock futures doing something similar this morning also with some green arrows on the screen. We'll show you those. Right now, S&amp;P 500 up 2/10 of a percent. \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" next for you here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>DON IMUS, FBN HOST: You know what's making me sick?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: What?</p><p>IMUS: Green tea -- making me ill, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm sorry about that. I just --</p><p>IMUS: So, my wife says to me -- I love her to death, believe me -- but she says, well this new stuff that she is giving me that kills -- they all kills cancer cells -- so far so good, you know, beats radiation or a stupid operation.</p><p>CHALES MCCORD, FBN NEWSCASTER: OK. Go on, make this a point.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: OK. But she says this new stuff she's giving me, she said it's detoxing your body.</p><p>MCCORD: Very well.</p><p>IMUS: And I'm thinking what is left to detox?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, right.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, what's left?</p><p>MCCORD: I know --</p><p>IMUS: You know what I had for dinner? An f-ing radish!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No wonder you're a grumpy man!</p><p>IMUS: I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No wonder you're crank tan.</p><p>IMUS: I had a radish!</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Oh, I'm full, thanks!</p><p>MCCORD: You look like an end of season corn husk. You've got to stop.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, \"IMUS IN THE MORNING.\"</p><p>IMUS: all right, five minutes after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the radio around the country and on the Fox Business Network. Pretty good line-up this morning. we'll start with Geraldo Rivera. He's coming up. We'll check in his five favorite songs, Charles. They are \"Me And Bobby Mcgee,\" Janice Joplin. \"Love Me Tender,\" Elvis. They sang all the Elvis songs last night on \"American Idol,\" which was a mistake for most of them. \"Girl From The North Country,\" Bob Dylan. \"Dance With My Father,\" Luther Vandross, and the Bruce Springsteen song, \"Streets of Philadelphia.\"</p><p>MCCORD: All right.</p><p>IMUS: And then David Kirby is coming up. David Kirby is the author of \"Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial Pig, Dairy, and Poultry Farms to Humans and The Environment. He's selling one book a day on Amazon.</p><p>MCCORD: That is wrong.</p><p>IMUS: He can't get on any -- he can't get on Fox and Fiends. He can't get on \"The Today Show.\" He can't get on anything. And, do you know why he can't?</p><p>MCCORD: I suspect why --</p><p>IMUS: Because nobody wants to talk about it. I was trying -- and I don't want to talk about it. I was talking to Lupica last night, and he starts going (INAUDIBLE). He wouldn't let me tell him about these factory farms. You know, there's -- nobody is railing against people -- I'm not at least, people who eat meat or poultry. I don't care what you eat.</p><p>MCCORD: Not at all!</p><p>IMUS: We raise cattle in New Mexico. My friends are cattle ranchers. That's not the point, but the way these animals are - well, you can't even -- like there's a site -- what is this site, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: There's a site called Farm Sanctuary, which is it's an outfit that does rescues although it's a pittance because of the massive dimensions of the problem, but they do some rescues of some of these animals that are factory, you know, factory processed before they process them, and the web site is -- shows both the farm sanctuary side and also the concentrated animal feeding operations side.</p><p>IMUS: Don't want to see it.</p><p>MCCORD: And --</p><p>IMUS: And people in the morning are trying to have their bacon and eggs --</p><p>MCCORD: Of course!</p><p>IMUS: -- and sausage with egg and muffin and all that. You don't want to hear about it, so I don't blame you.</p><p>MCCORD: Particularly, if you look at the egg production process.</p><p>IMUS: Believe me, you just do not want to know, but I like Kirby, and it's an important - you ought to read it. You ought to know about it.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, you really should. You really should.</p><p>IMUS: And, you know, there's a way to buy organic meat and to buy -- well, sort of.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And there's a way to -- well, there is and to eat animals, but animals are like us. They have -- I mean I've spent half \\my life with horses. I mean they -- and cattle. They have emotions. They --</p><p>MCCORD: They are just as complicated physical systems as we do.</p><p>IMUS: They feel pain.</p><p>MCCORD: They certainly do.</p><p>IMUS: They -- well, they are not a bunch of happy animals skipping around old McDonald's farm going in and out of the red barn. Did you know that, Jenna?</p><p>LEE: Well, now I do.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>MCCORD: Is ain't an oink, oink here and a cluck, cluck there.</p><p>IMUS: No. Not a happy little pig oiking in the thing</p><p>MCCORD: Here a cluck, there a cluck, everywhere.</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: So --</p><p>MCCORD: Fuzzy-wuzzy was a bear.</p><p>IMUS: That's what you have to look forward to in about an hour.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's something that you should know about.</p><p>IMUS: He's the guy who wrote \"Evidence of Harm,\" you know.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You don't want to talk about that, either.</p><p>MCCORD: No, of course not&gt;</p><p>IMUS: But, so -- including, by the way, me. But I will, because --</p><p>MCCORD: Animal lover.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know why I'm willing to do it, I just am. And then <person><nameText>Tom Friedman </nameText></person>is coming up. A good column he has in the paper this morning about Op-Ed page of the \"New York Times\" about Iraq and Afghanistan. How he -- did you read it, Bernie?</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER: I read some of it. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: It's pretty good.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn good.</p><p>IMUS: Well, it is --</p><p>MCCORD: I'll take a look at it.</p><p>IMUS: -- heretofore whenever we get involved with one of these countries, we didn't care exactly what they did in the country and the cold war as long as they lined up with us. If we support some a despot, well that was just --.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it was, yes.</p><p>IMUS: But, now we're more idealistic, and we want to change the culture of these countries.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: We want the people to be -- I mean it's just so insane.</p><p>MCCORD: Hearts and minds.</p><p>IMUS: You can't -- it's -- even Friedman this morning admits that it's stupid. So, all of that stuff is coming up. Charles, what's the big news?</p><p>MCCORD: The big news story is another bad earthquake in the headlines, I-man. This one in province in province in Western China, and the death toll has risen -- the known death toll to at least 400 now.</p><p>And there's a good news story out of Florida with the successful recovery of this 11-year-old girl who has missing in swamps for some four days.</p><p>And the president of the United States saying the world is a more secure place now, post-nuclear summit that they did actually achieve some things there.</p><p>IMUS: We're having a guy on Friday, just one of full of surprise for his book \"The Dead End.\"</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: About the arms race trade in the United States and Russia. David Hoffman is his name. A spotlight on this whole, you know, what's really going on with this whole nuc thing</p><p>MCCORD: Clarity to that --</p><p>IMUS: Well, more interesting than talking about torturing little pigs and stuff. Jenna you don't seem that happy to see any of us this morning.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LEE: I'm thrilled to see you. How can you say such a thing?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. You just came in and well, here's a thing with Jenna, so -- we love her to death, by the way.</p><p>LEE: Here's the thing with Jenna. Yes?</p><p>IMUS: Is that we love her to death. What's going on in business?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: There you're done.</p><p>LEE: Very good.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. It's like, Wyatt says to me -- he's 11. He just says, \"You have to know when to shut up. Just shut up.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Wise beyond his years!</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Just be quiet. So, in business news, Jenna?</p><p>LEE: He seems to know more about women than --</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes he does.</p><p>LEE: -- some other people in the room.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>LEE: Well, the markets are trading higher this morning. We had a big tech company last night. Intel out with good numbers, and that helped the market. We're also going to get numbers from JP Morgan, a major investment bank today, or I should say, just bank in general. We're going to get those numbers in about 45 minutes and will mean a lot to the markets.</p><p>In the meantime, AIG is trying to pay us back, still they are selling 53 of their planes to a major Australian investment bank for about $2 billion, so that's going to come back to us and for all the private plane users in the room. This is for you, specifically. ABERCROMBIE &amp; Fitch is paying their CEO not to use the private jet. And if he goes over a certain amount, he's going to have to pay. So, they're paying him $4 million, just in case he goes over the amounts and then he has to pay back the company.</p><p>IMUS: Certainly that's not directed at me, I can't imagine that.</p><p>MCCORD: No, it's the rest of us private jet users!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: I just don't understand why we're bringing the hurt to the I- man. I just don't get that. Speaking of bringing of hurts to the I-man, Ronnie Deutsche --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes. I love this.</p><p>IMUS: -- who is this tax babe. She -- I don't know. I was just talking about her yesterday. This image I have of her at the end of the bar at 9:00 at night -- every night at the Blarney Stone with a pell-mell dangling out of the corner of her mouth, hunched over a glass of Jack Daniels, you know, who's going to be next.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Shot and a beer chaser!</p><p>IMUS: Exactly.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: She says, \"Dear Imus, I am a cigar smoking woman, so I thought you might enjoy my favorite cigar\" -- and always a great thing to give a cancer patient --</p><p>MCCORD: Perfect!</p><p>IMUS: Somebody with emphysema. Anyway, enjoy -- this woman is so dumb. It makes my -- actually it makes my toenails hurt. \"Enjoy and happy tax season.\"</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Ronnie, what you can do with this --</p><p>MCCORD: Well, no, no, no.</p><p>IMUS: Well, she's not dumb, and she's a nice lady, and here's the cigar.</p><p>MCCORD: That's no good.</p><p>IMUS: Nub using our Jackson. Actually, do you smoke cigars?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No.</p><p>IMUS: You don't? How about nub?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I do!</p><p>IMUS: You can have this one.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: OK. Anyway, Warner got sports. He's coming up. Jim Nantz all over Tiger Woods, huh, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, FBN SPORTSCASTER: Oh, man, what happened?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean just --</p><p>WOLF: Hey dawg!</p><p>IMUS: Well, you know, Warner. Somebody asked me, \"why is Warner calling you dawg.\" I said, \"Oh about a week ago, I said something, I referred to him as dawg, what's going on.\" And so now, Warner is doing that.</p><p>WOLF: That's right.</p><p>IMUS: But he does it and nobody knows why.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: Well, I thought you were talking to Rob.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Well, Rob is great for doing that. I'll make just some offhand comment.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Sometimes even off the air, and Rob will write a bit about it, assuming that everybody knows what we're talking about and of course, nobody does. At any rate, -- well, Nantz is saying that if he would used the kind of language Tiger Woods used that had got on CBS mics as Tiger Woods did. He'll be fired, and he's right about that.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And, two, as others have said, Lupica and you, Warner Wolf, and Nantz, and that is the Tiger is going to use -- the Tiger says he's going to try to do better than do better.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: If you're going to behave better, then behave better, which he did not do, and as Nantz pointed out, if somebody offered him and said, well, tiger had a camera in his face all day. Nantz say \"well, so did Phil Mickelson.\"</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Phil didn't say anything.</p><p>WOLF: No!</p><p>IMUS: All Phil did was win.</p><p>WOLF: That's it!</p><p>IMUS: Which Tiger didn't do.</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Well, he's right!</p><p>WOLF: Nantz is absolutely right, and Tiger is the one that brought it up.</p><p>IMUS: And the Yankees won the home opener.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, they did. Biggest crowd ever in the new stadium for a regular season game.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>WOLF: And there's a couple of good stories. Bulls General Manager, John Paxon, apparently challenged Bulls' coach Vinnie Delnegro to a fight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RUFINO: That great!</p><p>IMUS: What happened?</p><p>WOLF: Well, we'll see what happens there, and the Bulls are investigating. Well, that looks like the story. Ben Roethlisberger met with NFL commissioner Goodell yesterday and faces possible suspension and Beef Jerky has dropped their sponsorship for Big Ben's Beef Jerky giving our beef a bad name. And, Barry Bonds -- Barry bonds says, \"I'm proud of Mark McGwire for admitting he used steroids.\" Barry Bonds.</p><p>IMUS: And Bernie has a briefing sponsored by P.C. Richard and Son. What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, first of all. President Obama is going to go to Poland this weekend for the president's funeral, there. The polish president died in the air crash, which is a nice thing. He said a lot of things about President Obama, give up a weekend. It's actually a nice gesture.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And Conan O'Brien going to TBS. He's pushing back George Lopez, and there's a lot of talk about Lopez getting disked and getting the ironically the Conan treatment from TBS. Anyway, he had Chris Rock on the show last night, and they were discussing just that.</p><p>CHRIS ROCK, ARTIST (?): Where are you going?</p><p>CONAN O'BRIEN, TBS HOST (?): I'm going to midnight. He's coming on 11:00, and I'm going to midnight.</p><p>ROCK: Get the hell out of here!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK: So, you're going to move for the white man! -</p><p>O'BRIEN: I am.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ROCK: I hope he appreciate this.</p><p>O'BRIEN: I think the white man does appreciate it very much.</p><p>ROCK: OK. You go got to clean the park or nothing.</p><p>O'BRIEN: No, I got to go to work an hour later.</p><p>ROCK: OK.</p><p>O'BRIEN: A dream come true.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I'm just glad Jimmie Norton didn't make those jokes but like the politically incorrect humor.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. That was good, funny.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's from last night.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen -- wheels just came off right there, didn't they, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: A little bit.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Give you time to get your bacon and sausage going and all that and then we'll fire up \"Animal Factory\" and David Kirby in about an hour. However, next is Geraldo Rivera. This is one of his favorite songs, one of mine, too.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: Are you looking for an investment opportunity, but you're not sure where to start?

Planetfitness.com, check them out.</p><p>IMUS: This is the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Time now for a business update from the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's you're Fox Business Minute on this Wednesday morning. President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today to talk about financial regulation reform. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner saying, quote \"republicans won't want to be on this wrong side of this.\" But, Mitch McConnell saying the democrats won't solve any problems and will provide endless protection for banks.</p><p>Big banks fighting against tough derivatives rules. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Morgan Stanley telling the senate agricultural committee. Stricter rules will limit profits. The committee chairman Blanche Lincoln is expected to propose a more aggressive approach to sweeping changes to the derivatives market.</p><p>And, Fed Chief Ben Bernanke testifying on the Hill today to offer his outlook for the economy. Lawmakers on the joint economic committee will likely question him about the strength of the recovery and also the pace of job growth. Fed officials have pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for an extended period to boost spending. Wall Street waiting to hear if the Fed will move away from that commitments.</p><p>All right, let's take a quick look at our futures here on a Wednesday morning in positive -- well, positive territory ahead of JP Morgan's numbers. We expect those in a little more than half an hour. Over to Charles now for this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And a couple of these stories that we're following this morning, Jenna. There's another bad earthquake in the headlines. The number of dead and injured from a strong earthquake Western China is climbing.</p><p>Chinese State Television saying at least 400 people had been killed, more than 10,000 injured. Rescue workers trying to dig trapped people out of the rubble of collapsed mud and wood houses. Scores of people gathering out in the open areas searching for relatives, a scene we have seen too much certainly of late.</p><p>Tea party movement having a homecoming of sports today. Sarah Palin scheduled to headline a rally in Boston. The city from which tea party supporters revolutionary spirit was born. They figured it will be like 10,000 people or so to turn out.</p><p>Couple of the headlines as the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program continues for you, right now, here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Twenty-four after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Network. Geraldo Rivera is coming up in just a couple of minutes here.</p><p>And the David Kirby and his book, \"Animal Factory.\" Charles and I were talking about last night and we're talking about it this morning, and I don't know what the solution is. But it's certainly is worth discussing. You know, but -- you know, people like John Stewart, you know I like.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And David Colbert -- or Steven Colbert and some of these other shows that this would be a natural for -- Stewart is much as I like him. He won't beat up on anybody. He won't talk about anything, unless it's safe. I mean beating up Fox News or whatever it is or Glenn Beck, that's a safe target for him.</p><p>MCCORD: Exactly.</p><p>IMUS: So -- but, putting somebody on or Colbert putting -- putting David Kirby on with \"Animal Factory\" is not safe for them, and they don't have -- I don't want to be too harsh here. They won't do it. They just don't have the guts. They're fighting and they don't want to know about it, and they don't want somebody in a suit to tell them they can't do it.</p><p>MCCORD: It is certainly worth the conversation, the subject.</p><p>IMUS: But, people think well, then, you know, people like David Kirby are screaming at you that you can't eat meat, but he's not saying that.</p><p>MCCORD: That is not -- at all.</p><p>IMUS: But there's certainly is far more humane way to go about this and it will cost more.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: But, the amount of money saves in health care costs would be so astronomical that it would be ridiculous, but that doesn't help the people processing the meat and the poultry because they don't -- they costs them more.</p><p>MCCORD: And as you said last night, it doesn't have to be done overnight, but you can take a baby step here and there.</p><p>IMUS: It's already tedious, and we've only talked about it for a minute ago.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No not at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: Well, we want to --</p><p>IMUS: Bernie already wants to kill him.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God!</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's me point. Here's Warner with sports. Good morning, Warner.</p><p>WOLF: Good morning, I-man. Baseball, 49,000, Yankees Home Opener including George Steinbrenner. Yankees almost blew a 5 up and lead held on beat the Angels, 7 to 5. They took Andy Pettitte out after 6 with a 5 nothing lead. Jeter and Nick Johnson home run for the Yanks. Here's the call, Michael Kay, Yes Network.</p><p>MICHAEL KAY, RADIO COMMENTATOR: This was a hit to right field. There it goes. See yeah!</p><p>WOLF: The biggest hand, Angels DH and former Yankee Hideki Matsui hugged by his teammates receiving a standing-o, receiving his World Series Ring. However, as a joke, Derek Jeter gave Matsui a fake ring.</p><p>DEREK JETER: We knew he wouldn't be able to compare to it anyone because he was on the other side. So, knowing Matsui, he's probably proud to get the bootleg one too, and then we get him the real one.</p><p>WOLF: And the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2. Guess what, I-man?</p><p>IMUS: What a whacky team, huh?</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, crazy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Loose.</p><p>RUFINO: We replaced the ring and give him this one!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Not so funny!</p><p>RUFINO: And then we gave him triple glass.</p><p>WOLF: You thought I was going to play the Japanese voice, right, I- man?</p><p>IMUS: Well, you never know.</p><p>WOLF: No. I wouldn't do that to you.</p><p>IMUS: Of course you would!</p><p>WOLF: Me? No! By the way, the Jays beat the White Sox, 4 to 2. The game was over in two hours and 11 minutes. Whoa! Mets lost, 56,000 Dodgers home opener. Dodgers beat the backs, 9 to 5. Manny Steroid Home Run number 547. The first pitch was thrown out by Will I-am of the Black Eyed Peas. And the anthem was sung by Leann Rimes. Ben Roethlisberger after his meeting here in New York with commissioner Goodell said --</p><p>IMUS: Are you drunk, Warner?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: You sound drunk.</p><p>RUFINO: What you got there on the console there?</p><p>WOLF: Wait a minute, I though that -- I thought the wine wore off. Wait a minute!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Come on, dawg!</p><p>RUFINO: This dawg is drunk!</p><p>IMUS: Here's a deal. We got a press on, Warner. We're begging you.</p><p>WOLF: Here's a great story. According to eye witnesses, after the Bull-Suns game two weeks ago, Bulls General Manager, John Paxon charged into the office of Bulls Coach Vinnie Delnegro. Grabbed Delnegro by the tie and poked him repeatedly in the chest because of Delnegro's use of joke him Noah. Paxon while being pulled off by the assistant, Bernie Bickerstaff, challenged Delnegro to a fight. However, Delnegro did not retaliate knowing that the Bulls could void his contract. Here is Delnegro.</p><p>VINNIE DELNEGRO, BULLS' COAH: No comment on that. Whatever happens is between the organization, myself, and the people involved, you know, that is our internal stuff.</p><p>WOLF: Aha! So, the Bulls have hired lawyers to get more interviews and see what happens.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-nine after the hour here on the \"IMUS IN THE MORNING\" program. Time for the Fox Business Networkbusiness report and here with that is Dagen McDowell. Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: So, I was talking to a friend of mine last night, and this friend of min is Lupica. He said, \"Dagen thinks that she's normal, though she is interesting different. I said, yes. And you do, don't you?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm not normal?</p><p>IMUS: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why not?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't know.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, why not? Everybody gets their freak on in some way, it's everybody else who thinks they are normal, you know? I think I'm normal. Everybody has issues.</p><p>IMUS: No, don't you think, Charles she's normal.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, NEWSMAN: I think she is, one of the more normal people that I have ever met.</p><p>IMUS: She is?</p><p>MCCORD: She just has a couple of issues, she's more willing to discuss them maybe, than the average person.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>MCCORD: That's all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People don't south don't try and hide the crazy folks in their family. They trot them out. That is a good time.</p><p>IMUS: What they've done in your case, which is fine with us.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, PROGRAM PRODUCER: They date them.</p><p>IMUS: They marry them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's shockingly enough I edit myself, pretty heavily.</p><p>IMUS: You do?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCCORD: That's disturbing.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Well, it's like getting in the shoving matches with people on the train, I mean.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I didn't know -- I didn't touch anybody. I got in his face with my finger because he cursed at me.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know?</p><p>MCCORD: He can't be doing that.</p><p>(ALL TALKING OVER EACH OTHER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, do not -- no no, no, no, no. I got a whole treasure trove...</p><p>IMUS: I brought my nuts to work here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank goodness and have mercy on this planet that you got some food.</p><p>MCGUIRK: We were starting to wonder.</p><p>IMUS: You are such an idiot.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: See they're in a bag.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right. That is refreshing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm going to start frisking you every morning to make sure you've got some food.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They look like even they were stomped on a bunch.</p><p>IMUS: This is a week's supply, Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, it's a week supply, that's not for just a day to have with a Martini? Come on.</p><p>IMUS: And Dagen for the business news, Geraldo is standing by here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Quickly, if a story has anything to do with money, let's call it a business story. On that note, Former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer spent $100,000 on call girls. Over a roughly two year period, this is according to Peter Elkin's upcoming book, \"Rough Justice.\" This is on page six of \"The New York Post\" today about 20 appointments, with ten escorts over at least two years, by my Math, that is about $5,000 a pop. One escort told Peter Elkin, it was very business like, he was not one of those people who I would have said, went out of their way to make me feel lovely and nice like many did.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And you're a hooker. What the hell.</p><p>IMUS: That is why he's paying you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, calm down...</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you, if you are getting paid, that is all you get.</p><p>IMUS: We are not going over to trumps to buy a bunch of stuff! It's 32 after the hour here on the IMUS IN the morning program. Dagen McDowell with the fox Business Networkbusiness report. She'll be back, of course, and so will Jenna. It's one of Geraldo's favorite songs, we're way late for him but we're playing his song, so, what's he care?</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>Announcer: Warning, some content may be unsuitable for mature audiences. IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: A business alert for you now. Opec slightly raising its 2010 World Oil demand growth forecast to 900,000 barrels per day.

And I guarantee they are talking about what time kfc opens and they can get a double down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can I tell them what you just said? Yo, are you talking about where you will get lunch, like kfc, because again, if you don't want the abuse, don't stand behind the camera, right?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Damn right.</p><p>IMUS: Well, whatever, we wonder what they are doing, so. They are not paying attention to you, that is for sure, so.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. They are trying to ignore me, probably because I'm liable to lock horns with them and just cause a big uproar in the middle of the newsroom.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: All right. I'm eating a nut. Well, the -- where's Geraldo?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He is off the radar right now.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Apparently his plane has not landed from Afghanistan, just yet. He was supposed to have landed already, but some sort of delay.</p><p>IMUS: Is he coming back this morning or are you just jerking my chain?</p><p>MCGUIRK: No, no. I just spoke to the one and only Mrs. Rivera and she was expecting -- he should have been walking through.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, that's fine. OK. The Addams -- man, I keep on coughing and everything else. The Addams family open on Broadway last Thursday. And, Jerry Zack is directing it but he was brought in, it was in Chicago, and they brought him to New York and it needed to be fixed and so they brought him and they fix it and they fixed it a little. But here's the Ben Brantley, here's the opening paragraph of the review from last Thursday, Charles.</p><p>\"Imagine if you dare the agonies of the talented people trapped inside the collapsing tomb called the Addams family. Being in this genuinely ghastly musical, which opened Thursday night, at the Lunt-fontanne Theater, and stars a shame fully squandered at Nathan lane and Bebe Neuwirth must feel like going to a Halloween party in a straight jacket or a suit of armor. Sure you make a flashy, if obvious first impression, but then you are stuck in the darned thing for the rest of the night and it is really, really uncomfortable. You can barely move, and a strangled voice inside you keeps gasping, help! Get me out of here!\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCCORD: And not what the, not what the Addams family folks were looking for, I don't think.</p><p>IMUS: The next -- last weekend they sold a million dollars worth of tickets, you can't get a ticket, to it until the fall.</p><p>MCCORD: Wow!</p><p>IMUS: So, it had a huge advance and the universally awful review.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a rough opening paragraph.</p><p>IMUS: Particularly from the times, the one that matters, you know?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, it hasn't apparently hurt them. I received an e-mail, from the doctor wanting to know if I wanted to come and see it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: But I want to see million dollar quartet and American idiot, before I see, OK. I mean, I was going to Broadway season, it's going to be -- it's going to be one musical after another.</p><p>RUFINO: Mr. First Nighter.</p><p>IMUS: One or two would be about it, you know, so.</p><p>WARNER WOLF, SPORTSCASTER: I saw one last Sunday, I-man.</p><p>IMUS: What did you see Warner?</p><p>WOLF: It's called \"Enron,\" it's about the scandal, obviously.</p><p>IMUS: No kidding!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: No, you know, it was over. When the scandal -- I could never understand what actually happened, but in the play, oh, you see what they actually did. Just, gosh stole the money on nothing and they sold the stock and had nothing.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>WOLF: It was pretty good. I thought it was interesting.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, selling stock based on nothing was pretty good or the musical, or it was the musical or just the play?</p><p>WOLF: No, although they.</p><p>IMUS: Is it the musical or play?</p><p>WOLF: It's a play.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it's a play.</p><p>WOLF: But they do have music in it.</p><p>IMUS: Well, OK, that's a life that you have -- we need an intervention. I mean, if you have to go see a play based on the \"Enron Scandal,' really, you need some help!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: And a musical, that's kind of idiotic, why not sing songs about it?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, PROGRAM ENGINEER: Here comes Enron.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: Dice Clay.</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS DICE CLAY: We have Dice Clay.</p><p>IMUS: What is Dice have?</p><p>BARTLETT: Dice says, the top eight most surprising revelations in Kitty Kelly's Oprah book.</p><p>IMUS: Well, why don't we do them?</p><p>BARTLETT: All right, then, I'm over here now, you know.

Number seven: Her low self-esteem is responsible for her weight gains and her relationship with John Tesh, oh! Number six: The lavish gifts she sent to Diane Sawyer were just the ruse to get close to that tasty albino hunk Mike Nichols, oh! Number five: She once shot a man in Reno just to watch him die. Number four: She can belch the alphabet all the way to the letter q. Number three: She tried to sue the Grand Ole Opry for copy write infringement. Number two: She keeps Steadman around only because Michael Jackson already bought the elephant man's bones, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee, gee.

This coming after President Obama told President Hu that he hopes China will let the Yuan rise, the president saying, he had quote, \"Frank discussions with him on the currency issue.\" Mr. Obama saying, a move for China towards a more market oriented approach is the right one.</p><p>Greece successfully raises $2 billion through a bond sale, the demand for its bond is seen as a good sign that it is -- can keep raising money without accepting a bailout that the interest rate of four and a half percent is too high for the country to afford over the long term.</p><p>And, get this one, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch paying its ceo to stop using the corporate jet. The company saying, it will pay for $200,000 worth of flights for ceo Michael Jefferies each year. After that, he has to pay the company back, and to help him with that, Abercrombie giving him a $4 million lump sum. Must be nice.</p><p>That's a look at your \"FOX Business Minute.\"</p><p>Taking a look at the European markets, this morning, up across the board, about a half of percent in London on the CacQuarante in Paris, and also, the Dax in Germany. As for the u.s. futures board, also pointing slightly higher, across the board.</p><p>More imus in the morning coming up next.</p><p>IMUS: Seven minutes until the hour here on the imus in the morning program, let's go behind the scenes at the Imus in the morning program, on both radio and on the FOX Business Network. How is it that this is the only program, and it's not -- not the program isn't now bigger than it ever was?</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: On both radio and television, bigger than we ever were, how is it that we book people, who don't appear? How does that happen?</p><p>MCCORD: I just think they get to thinking about it.</p><p>IMUS: How did that -- you butt out. How does that happen, Bernard?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Apparently Geraldo, his plane was delayed or something, is the information we had, maybe we could ask Tom.</p><p>IMUS: Why, is it Tom's fault?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, no, no. I mean, we went through the FOX bookers in this case, so.</p><p>TOM `BIGFOOT' BOWMAN, PROGRAM PRODUCER: We normally go through the Media Department here at FOX, so I think, actually what happened was there was some mix-up with the days, and, they got it wrong.</p><p>IMUS: That would be important in booking a guest.</p><p>BOWMAN: Booking the right day, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Would get the day right.</p><p>BOWMAN: The date and the time, I think are two important elements, sort of like headphones and a clock.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Knowing the way FOX runs, I can't believe it was their fault. I mean, the Media Department, I can't believe that they screwed it up.</p><p>BOWMAN: Well, I'm not blaming it on the whole department, but I think there was some confusion on their end.</p><p>IMUS: So, you're throwing the FOX Media Department under the bus.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm not throwing the whole department under the bus.</p><p>IMUS: It sounds to me like you are.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm just saying that there was a mix up with the day...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>IMUS: No, you don't want to mix up with some big load sitting in the control room. That is where it was.</p><p>BOWMAN: I'm going to come down there and I'm going to whip up on you.</p><p>IMUS: Come on down, bitch, come on down...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BOWMAN: Yes.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: IMUS, IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Larry, how are you?</p><p>ROB BARTLETT, AS LARRY KING: Elizabeth Taylor tweeting yesterday, she's not engaged to her manager, Jason Winters, I guess she doesn't want anyone to think she is off the market. Because, you know, there are some guys who believe that 300 pounds, 78-year-old husband in a wheelchair is a catch. I'm not surprised she's not engaged, I mean, this guy has got no motivation to make it legal. He's what's that old saying, he's milking the cow for free. Besides the age difference is prohibitive. She's almost 30- years-older than him. Her ovaries dried up before he even had a feather on his schmigel (ph), what's in it for him?</p><p>RUFINO: Oh, Jesus!</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I don't know if we need that kind of detail, do you Larry?</p><p>BARTLETT: What's in it for him?</p><p>IMUS: I don't know.</p><p>BARTLETT: Besides the good parking spots, unless she still a goa, I mean, I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating the olive loaf and as long as I got the private duty nurse to push the wheelchair back in forth, it will be a hell of a less work. It wouldn't be the first time I took a safari through her Velcro triangle.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Between Larry -- and Michael Jackson. We were on the beach at Santro pay, I was under the humumo (ph) for 45 minutes, nobody noticed a thing, because that was back when she was looking like an Albino, Leon Sphinx, you could have hidden a Volkswagen under there and nobody beginning to wise up. Slick was in Alabama, the Yin Yang twins are a little scrappy, who's got the most pranxious, your thoughts?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: Larry King here on the imus in the morning program.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep it right here on the FOX Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments.

That's 10 cents higher than the Wall Street estimate, if those two numbers are comparable to each other.</p><p>The revenue results -- the sales results are also better than expected more than $28 billion, when the Street was looking for $26 billion plus. There is the JP Morganstock price on the screen next to me, at $46.10 a share, up from yesterday's close, of $45.87.</p><p>Among other things, JP Morganled by its CEO Jamie Dimon saying it's continuing to see its delinquencies stabilize and that the economy still faces challenges, as the bank puts it this morning.</p><p>Now, the total profit for the quarter, the net income, was $3.3 billion dollars. So, a $3.3 billion dollar profit for JP Morganand what it still described as a challenging economic environment. But the company does report profit that's better than expected by 10 cents a share -- 74 cents, versus 64 cents.</p><p>It'll certainly be a stock to watch today, it comes on the heels to better than expected results last night from Intel. We'll see if those two put together able to put the stock market on a firm footing this morning.</p><p>Now, we have another piece of breaking news to get to this morning on the housing market, that would be the latest mortgage applications figures and those went down last week, the overall number, the headline figure was down by more than nine percent. One of the things we have been reporting on here at Fox Business in recent weeks have been the rising of mortgage rates.</p><p>So, fewer people applying for mortgages; 9.6 percent drop. Now the mortgage rates, the 30-year-fixed mortgage rate was up last week to around 5.3 percent. It came down in the most recent week, a little bit; so mortgage rates, after spiking up one week, now coming back down this week.</p><p>We are up on the futures, 32 on the DOW futures and more coverage of this breaking news and all of the top headlines of the day straight ahead as IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>Don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON IMUS, IMUS IN THE MORNING: What's coming up, on \"Varney and Company?\"</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\": Well, you know, Roni Deutsch, the tax lady.</p><p>IMUS: I saw her on with Cavuto. You know what I thought? She will not be doing my taxes, but I'm sure she's fine.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, yesterday --</p><p>IMUS: I have this -- I have this image of Roni, every night around 9:00, she is down at the end of the bar there at the Blarney Stone -- (INAUDIBLE) big old gold glass of Jack Daniels, a Pall Mall hanging out of the corner of her mouth, saying last night I did an Iraqi cab driver, I hope I'll be lucky tonight.</p><p>VARNEY: I like the way she comes on the commercial and says, \"I'm Roni Deutsch\". You know, I like that.</p><p>IMUS: No if she's been around the block. So --</p><p>VARNEY: Well, she's --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country and on the Fox Business Networkall over the world. David Kirby, we've been talking about him all morning and his book, \"Animal Factory\" coming up.</p><p>And Charles -- Charles and I are both stupefied, over a -- thanks -- over a -- the fact that Kirby can't get any traction with his book. That is a -- that's a major publisher.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He wrote a best-seller with \"Evidence of Harm\". His new book is called \"Animal Factory\". Well, because nobody --</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody wants to hear.</p><p>IMUS: Nobody wants to discuss it and I don't blame him. So --</p><p>MCCORD: Give me my Jimmie Dean sausage and forget about it.</p><p>BERNIE MCGUIRK, IMUS IN THE MORNING: And so we cancel him or what?</p><p>IMUS: No, we're going to talk it.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh.</p><p>IMUS: He can't get on anyplace, he can get on here. So you're not going to see him on the \"Today Show\" or \"Good Morning America\" or \"Fox and Fiends\", you just not -- you're not going to see him anywhere because they don't want to talk about it and I don't blame him.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The I-man treads where no host --</p><p>IMUS: No, I just like him and I think the point is, when I found out how they processed chicken I stopped eating it, before I stopped eating all the stuff. I mean, I couldn't do it and now -- and there is a -- there's another way to do it. Nobody is saying don't go to McDonald's, I'm not saying that at all or anything even close to it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: How about Burger King?</p><p>IMUS: Fine.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: But there's a -- and you can't do it overnight. But, boy there is a far more humane way to raise these animals and, to slaughter them than what they're doing. I mean, it is -- if you knew how what they were doing it is horrific, that you can't -- Charles can't even tell me about it can you.</p><p>MCCORD: No, because I know how you worry you don't want to hear about these things.</p><p>IMUS: Like I can't watch scary movies?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Deirdre and Wyatt watch them and I can't attend to it.</p><p>MCCORD: Understood.</p><p>IMUS: The violence, I can't stand it.</p><p>MCCORD: So I'm not going to tell you about the baby chickens at the grinder. I just don't want to tell you about those kinds of things.</p><p>IMUS: And chickens, the -- I tried to tell Lupica about it last night and he starts screaming on the phone. He said I don't want to hear about it. I said if your kids knew how these animals were treated they wouldn't -- you wouldn't be sitting around the hotel there with a big old bucket of chicken wings, you wouldn't do it, you just wouldn't.</p><p>Or -- or you -- or you would get some free range chickens and -- if you could.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: You can eat them. He just went -- I don't want to hear it.</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS IN THE MORNING: He's making chicken noises.</p><p>IMUS: Making chicken noises. He doesn't want to hear about it.</p><p>RUFINO: No, no, no, no --</p><p>IMUS: Matt and Katie or Meredith, whoever is there now -- they're going to --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, come on, no.</p><p>IMUS: Are they're going to sit there and talk to David Kirby? But what is he nuts? No, nobody is going to talk to him about it.</p><p>RUFINO: Good morning, this is today, let's talk about slaughtering animals.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, it's just --</p><p>RUFINO: Let's bring the calf right over here now, what's the weather doing?</p><p>MCCORD: We hear about the screams of (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: I mean, you know.</p><p>RUFINO: Let's bring Hannibal Lecter over here.</p><p>IMUS: I didn't help myself -- I didn't help myself when I got in trouble with this idiotic crusade I got into with -- over Thimerosal and all of that. So -- and this doesn't help, either, except that I'm more reasonable about it than other people at my house.</p><p>What's the big -- and the other person in my house happens to be right. You have to do what you got to do. What is the big news story, Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: The 6.9 magnitude earthquake in a province in western China where it is known that at least 400 people have died and maybe 10,000 or more hurt. And the casualty count is expected to go higher, I-man. They've had some aftershocks in the 5.2 range.</p><p>IMUS: Aren't you going to China, Connell?</p><p>MCSHANE: I am, yes, I'm going on Saturday night, going to be there next week to do some reporting in Shanghai and Beijing. This is an awful story, though. This is the western part of the country.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>MCSHANE: So, nowhere near there, but --</p><p>IMUS: Oh so then it's fine or not.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, of course it's not. That's not what I said, don't start that, please.</p><p>MCCORD: Why do you do that? Why do you do that?</p><p>MCSHANE: Off for a couple days and now we're going to start right there, where we left off, which is --</p><p>IMUS: By the way we missed you.</p><p>MCSHANE: No, you didn't. You didn't miss -- no.</p><p>IMUS: You're right.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. I just thought we'll get that straight and then we can talk -- we actually have a lot of news. And maybe you're not interested but we have a lot of news --</p><p>IMUS: Well, if I was -- if I wasn't interested, why would I -- I don't have to put you on.</p><p>MCSHANE: Oh that's true. You have plenty of options, you're right.</p><p>IMUS: No, we love you. We really do like you. Well, what's going on?</p><p>MCSHANE: Well, JP Morganjust reported earnings, a minute ago I talked about this on television but the -- the big bank led by Jamie Dimon probably weathered the financial crisis better than anybody else. It just reported better than expected profits, made about $3 billion last quarter which was more than they were expected to the stock price up in pre-market trading.</p><p>So that will be something to watch.</p><p>And the other piece of breaking news we have is actually on the housing market. Fewer people applying for mortgages last week. Mortgage applications went down and the mortgage rate which we watch -- you know, real people really care about, where the mortgage rate is it was 5.3 percent on the 30 year fixed mortgage last week it came down about 5.17 percent, if you are in the market for a new home. There you go.</p><p>IMUS: Connell McShane with business news throughout the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Those of you watching Fox Business will notice that Connell has his power tie on this morning.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Because Jenna showed up in the electric blue dress and somehow you've got to deal with that.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's not easy. It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS: Oh no, no.</p><p>MCSHANE: It's not easy.</p><p>IMUS: Oh you put that girl on television and then what are you going to do? How do you follow that?</p><p>MCSHANE: It's an uphill battle but --</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Warner has sports. What's going on Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS IN THE MORNING: All right, I-Man, the Yankees win the opener and the Jays Ricky Romero lost a no hitter in the 8th inning. Bulls General Manager John Paxson (ph) has challenge Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro to a fight.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger met with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, faces possible suspension. Beef Jerky dropped their sponsorship for Roethlisberger.</p><p>And hooray for Jim Nantz for speaking out against Tiger Woods behavior.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Jimbo.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He had Nantz from downtown.</p><p>MCCORD: Damn right.</p><p>IMUS: -- showing some guts.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: Hole in one.</p><p>IMUS: Good for him. So kicking Tiger, one Tiger is down, when it is safe to do so. So how come Nantz wasn't saying anything about Tiger, which doesn't know anything about -- about his vile language, and the way he treated fans and everybody else, when he was winning? Where was Nantz then?</p><p>WOLF: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: Do you know where Nantz was, where was he? He was -- he was carrying the company's water. That's what he was doing.</p><p>MCGUIRK: One of the Tiger -- pre-scandal.</p><p>IMUS: Exactly.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Exactly. So -- now it's safe, let's jump on him. Which is why David Kirby can't get on anything. He can't get on -- you think Jon Stewart, or everybody knows (INAUDIBLE) I like a lot. And, same with Colbert, why can't you -- and this would be -- this is perfect for them.</p><p>MCCORD: I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS: You know why he can't get on there?</p><p>MCCORD: Why?</p><p>IMUS: Because they have no guts.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, because they want ratings.</p><p>IMUS: And they want ratings.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because they want people to watch.</p><p>MCCORD: They don't want to drive the audience away.</p><p>IMUS: The Bernie Briefing sponsored by PC Richard and Son, 100 year.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go Bernie.</p><p>IMUS: What's up, B?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Former Congressman Eric Massa from New York, who recently resigned over, you know, the tickle party sex scandal and all of that stuff, a male aide is actually suing him right now for sexual harassment. They said the guy -- that the Congressman groped and propositioned him and other male staffers, routinely made gestures that he wanted oral sex and it also came out, that in early February --</p><p>IMUS: I've done that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, that's nothing new but this is really ugly right here.</p><p>MCCORD: Leave me alone.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was at a service for a dead Marine in upstate New York and afterwards they were at a Knights of Columbus Hall and he was trying to pick up the bartender at the somber, solemn occasion, was this Eric Massa. Imagine serving on board a ship with this animal, for --</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: -- and he's in the Navy for like 20 years and reverend, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, he's getting, he's catching a little heat for something. He gave an interview to a New Jersey College and a wide ranging interview but among the topics, some of it was a gay marriage.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: And he said that you don't go ahead and accommodate every behavior pattern that is against the ideal. There are some people who believe incest so should we accommodate them? Others believe in polygamy, should we accommodate them? Then he went on to say, \"We should act in the best interest of children, not in the seaming interest of the adults. Children are not puppies.\" He'll catch a little heat for that. But he's - - that's his position.</p><p>IMUS: What's he saying about the puppies? And hurt the puppies? Charles?</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: What are you saying?</p><p>Thirteen after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>MCCORD: I don't know.</p><p>IMUS: I don't get that, Bernard.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They are not pets. Kids are for life.</p><p>IMUS: Oh.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>IMUS: All right. Let me tell you about Chamonix. Want to get rid of the fine lines on your face? Them wrinkles, all that? Then you need Esotique, the powerful collagen builder from Chamonix. How good is this stuff? If it doesn't work, they give you your money back.

Just came out at the top of the hour, better than expected, it's helping to drive the stock up in the pre-market by more than 2 percent. The financial giant reporting a profit of 74 cents a share; it's well ahead of the 64 cents the Street was expecting.</p><p>And revenue was also ahead of expectations; the revenue number came in at $28.17 billion. The estimate was just over $26 billion. So, better than forecast for JPMorgan, which says the total firm-wide credit reserves of more than $39 billion is 5.5 percent of total loans. And the firm says it continues to see its delinquencies stabilize.</p><p>Now as for the total assets under custody at JPMorgan, more than $15 trillion in the quarter; that is up by 13 percent. And it says it extended more than $2 billion in small business credit during the quarter, a lot of question about small business lending.</p><p>And CEO Jamie Dimon says his company continues to contribute to the economic recovery of small businesses and communities. He says, \"Building on the efforts of the Obama administration, JPMorgan has expanded its own efforts to support small business.\" Dimon also saying that efforts to prevent foreclosures have produced what he described as significant results.</p><p>There is the JPMorgan stock, $46.70.</p><p>Now let's go to the futures real quick. Ahead of the trading session on Wall Street with this earnings report in, and the one last night from Intel better than expected, futures pointing higher as we head to Charles for more of this morning's top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: Ok Connell. And the headline this morning the earthquake in China, the far western area, 6.9, remote region of the Tibetan Plateau in Qinghai province and they're figuring at least 400 people have died. Maybe 10,000 or so injured and they anticipate those figures will go up.</p><p>And the President ending the nuclear summit in Washington on an optimistic note. News conference said more than 45 world leaders have made progress and added that what they accomplished there will make this planet a safer place.</p><p>Those are a couple of the headline stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues for you right now here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: (INAUDIBLE) Billboard for George Thurgood and Buddy Guy, last summer out in -- appearing at one of the casinos out in Albuquerque, and man, how would you like to be in that dressing room with Buddy Guy?</p><p>MCCORD: If you can survive it.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. I just received an e-mail, I ordinarily never check this until around 8:00.</p><p>RUFINO: What? Almost never check your e-mails?</p><p>IMUS: Until around 8:00.</p><p>RUFINO: That's a good one.</p><p>IMUS: And Ester says -- the literary agent over at ICM, who now has a (INAUDIBLE) -- she holds the record as world's shortest person -- she wants to hear about the chickens.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, she does want to hear it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: She's the one.</p><p>IMUS: Wants to hear about the chickens. Before you go get this double-down over there at KFC, so. But there is a humane way to raise and slaughter chickens, right?</p><p>MCCORD: That is the whole thing that we're trying to get to, is that there is a better way of doing it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But it's not efficient.</p><p>MCCORD: But it's not efficient and it's going to cost money. You are absolutely right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I don't want to spend $25 on a double down, I want to spend $5.</p><p>IMUS: Don't you have -- do you have any pets, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I do.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. What do you have?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Miniature Schnauzer.</p><p>IMUS: And how would you feel if the animal were tortured like they torture the chickens and the pigs and the cows -- all those other animals.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would get violent. I love that dog.</p><p>IMUS: Ok. Then that's the point. That is our only point.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But I don't know the chickens.</p><p>MCCORD: The chicken is a stranger.</p><p>RUFINO: It comes on his plate.</p><p>IMUS: What do you mean you don't know the chicken?</p><p>MCGUIRK: The chickens aren't there when I come home wagging their tails, saying, \"Hey, happy to see you.\"</p><p>MCCORD: They would be if they were there.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, they would.</p><p>MCGUIRK: They'd be running around like peacocks, strutting their stuff, ignoring me. They wouldn't be as loving as the little pup.</p><p>IMUS: Cows can be.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Can they?</p><p>IMUS: Of course, absolutely.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: They have feelings just like you do.</p><p>MCCORD: And pigs can certainly be.</p><p>IMUS: Pigs can be a -- can make a great pet. Or back in the '80s, a date.</p><p>RUFINO: And they can be loving.</p><p>IMUS: Or if you are Tiger, now.</p><p>MCGUIRK: What the hell is going on out at that ranch?</p><p>IMUS: Anyway.

Remember he abruptly left the Mountaineers, just before the Fiesta Bowl to go to (INAUDIBLE) -- you remember that?</p><p>IMUS: Sure.</p><p>WOLF: Well, there may have been a good reason. NCAA investigators are now looking into possible rules violations while Rodriguez was head coach.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, darn.</p><p>WOLF: And to make it worse, Michigan is also under investigation where he's 3-and 9 and 5-7.</p><p>Baseball Jays Ricky Romero, had a no hitter broken up in the 8th inning while beating the White Sox, their only hit.</p><p>Here was Romero's wife, Ricky Romero's wife who wondered if his close call to history would go to his head.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'm not even cold yet and Ricky is lining up girls to take my place --</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>WOLF: And finally -- how about that -- and finally, my time is up.

Toyota has temporarily halted sales of that Lexus SUV that Consumer Reports yesterday morning said \"do not buy\". This is the Lexus GX 460. And, for people watching on TV, we're watching video from Consumer Reports. And, tight turns, the vehicle apparently fish-tails, and there is the possibility of a rollover.</p><p>Now a Lexus spokesman telling \"The Wall Street Journal\" engineers in the U.S. and Japan are working to reproduce the test. Hope to determine the cause of this by the end of the week and it could be tires. It could be suspension, could be shocks. It could be as simple as just reprogramming the stability control.</p><p>IMUS: Where is Rollo -- not Rollo -- What is his name?</p><p>RUFINO: Jasper.</p><p>IMUS: What is your husband's name?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jonas.</p><p>IMUS: Where is he this morning?</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's probably getting up and getting ready to walk the dog right now. Why?</p><p>IMUS: I just wondered. Listen to the way she asks that. Why. I just wondered where he was.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Why are you asking me that?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why do you wonder where my husband is at 7:30 a.m.? That maybe he left the house last night, after a little spat. Maybe the -- You know, maybe he's not there. That he's out gallivanting around somewhere. I don't know. What are you implying?</p><p>IMUS: Did you have a spat last night?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Life is a big spat, isn't it?</p><p>IMUS: Did you see that Warner? How her eyes shifted.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, I-man. She's lying.</p><p>IMUS: And, you didn't answer the question, yes or no.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I was being very difficult last night.</p><p>IMUS: You were?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I can't imagine that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Just fussing about just random stuff. So I will reform my ways and be a better wife today. I hope.</p><p>IMUS: I brought my assorted organic nuts in a bag this morning, these are -- what I get to eat for the week.</p><p>MCCORD: You are going through them like, you know -- water through a goose, for crying out loud. What are you doing? You're going to eat the whole week's worth now?</p><p>IMUS: Last night I had two radishes for dinner and a couple of artichoke hearts.</p><p>MCCORD: The heavy meal.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, you are not setting a good example for vegetarianism. You're telling people you don't eat meat, don't chicken, don't eat beat but then it makes you grumpy.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not telling people not to eat meat. You're wrong about that. I have friends who are cattle ranchers. I'm not saying that at all.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're right.</p><p>IMUS: I'm not saying don't eat chicken. I am not saying that. No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: No. Damn it.</p><p>IMUS: People don't have to do what I do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I misspoke. I'm just saying that you are not setting the best example.</p><p>IMUS: I'm obviously exaggerating.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Clearly.</p><p>IMUS: Clearly -- When I get home --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh really.</p><p>IMUS: I will get my -- chewed out, because that's what she says. And then Wyatt, the little parrot chimes in and says, \"I told you, mom.\" And I didn't really have a radish. Nobody believes that, but she thinks they do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I wasn't talking about that.</p><p>IMUS: I hope he leaves you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm talking about how grumpy you are in the morning.</p><p>IMUS: I'm sorry I said that. I said I hope he leaves you but I didn't mean that.</p><p>MCCORD: He's already gone.</p><p>IMUS: That was my anger. That was my anger -- that was my cancer talking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh my word. Oh, my word, that is terrible.</p><p>IMUS: I know. I said I apologize. What do you want me to do? I'm sorry. I apologize. Please accept --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You are asking a woman what you want to do, I can come up with a whole list. I have a brand new note pad right here, let me start writing it down --</p><p>IMUS: We look forward to that, next hour. Dagen McDowell with the Fox Business Networkreport and advice for life here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>Well David Kirby is next. Get ready to throw up your eggs.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Want some bacon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, man. I don't eat pork.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Are you Jewish.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No, I'm not Jewish, I just don't dig on swine. That's all.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why not?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pigs are filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hey, sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie but I never know because I wouldn't item the filthy (EXPLETIVE DELETED). Pigs, (INAUDIBLE) (EXPLETIVE DELETED) that is a filthy animal and I'm not eating nothing that doesn't have sense enough to disregard its own feces.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I don't eat dog either.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do you consider dog to be a filthy animal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they are definitely dirty. But, dogs got personality. Personality goes a long way.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So by that rationale if a pig has personality, it ceased to be a filthy animal, is that true?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We have to be talking about one charming (EXPLETIVE DELETED) pig. I mean, he has to be ten times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres, you know what I'm saying?</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, shares of JPMorgan are up in the premarket. The bank reporting a better than expected earnings that we've been reporting on this hour, seeing improving trends on consumer loans and mortgages, hopeful for a strong economic recovery according to the CEO Jamie Dimon, 46.89.</p><p>Now, let's run through the rest of your \"FOX Business Minute\" with President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today talking about financial regulatory reform. Treasury Secretary Geithner saying, and this is a quote, \"Republicans won't want to be on the wrong side of this.\" But Republican Mitch McConnell did say that the Democrat's plan will not solve any problems and it will provide endless protection for the banks.</p><p>Big banks, meantime, are fighting against tough derivatives rules, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, all telling the Senate Agriculture Committee stricter rules will limit their profits. But committee chairman Blanche Lincoln expected a propose (sic) a more aggressive approach with sweeping changes to the derivatives market.</p><p>And the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, testifying today on Capitol Hill offering his outlook for the economy. Lawmakers on the Joint Economic Committee likely to question him about the strength of recovery and also the pace of job growth. Fed officials have pledged to keep interest rates at record lows for what they describe as an extended period of time in order to boost spending and Wall Street waiting to here if the Fed will at anytime in the near future move away from that commitment to keep rates low for an extended period.</p><p>Futures this morning have been up ahead of the trading session on Wall Street after JPMorgan's results this morning and Intel's last night. IMUS IN THE MORNING continues right here on the FOX Business Network.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Knicks down by 10 in the fourth quarter and closed the garden with a win last night, beating the Wiz.

Thirty-four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program on the radio all over the country and on the FOX Business Network. What's the matter with you? You look like you're choking.</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's pollen. I think that's the problem.</p><p>IMUS: David Kirby who we've been talking about all morning, is a \"Huffington Post\" contributor, that's too bad. And author of the \"New York Times\" best seller \"Evidence of Harm\" winner of the 2005 investigative reporters' and editors' award for best book and finalist for the New York Public Library Helen Bernstein Award for Excellence in Journalism. He lives over there in Brooklyn. His new book is called \"Animal Factory: The Looming Threat of Industrial, Pig, Dairy and Poultry Farms to Human Environment\" and nobody wants to read it.</p><p>DAVID KIRBY, AUTHOR: No-body.</p><p>IMUS: They're selling one book a day at Amazon.</p><p>KIRBY: Travesty.</p><p>IMUS: And it's a major publisher St. Marten is not some chump self-published deal, so -- please welcome to the program our old friend David Kirby.</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Kirby.</p><p>KIRBY: Thanks Mr. Imus, thanks for having me back on. You know, when I first -- when the book came out March 2 and started selling fairly well, but right now not doing as good.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you can't get on any of these programs.</p><p>KIRBY: Not yet. National broadcast and television has not really responded.</p><p>IMUS: Well, what, what in your head told you that \"Today Show\" or FOX and fiends or \"Good Morning America\" wants to have you on to talk about how they -- how meat's processed or poultry or pigs or that sort of thing?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, it's a topic that people don't want to face. I mean, I would say my book is more than just a catalog of horrors. It does tell real stories about real people. NPR online said it reads like a thriller, the compared it to Upton Sinclair, BookList said it was compelling...</p><p>IMUS: NPR sucks.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, NPR...</p><p>IMUS: Dreadful.</p><p>KIRBY: You know, I was scheduled to go on one of their shows and they canceled me.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course they did.</p><p>KIRBY: They said they were a little tired of the topic.</p><p>IMUS: Well no, they don't want to hear about the topic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody does.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you sent a copy to the president and first lady. What did they -- and actually liked it. What did they do?</p><p>KIRBY: Have not heard back from anybody at the White House.</p><p>IMUS: No, no. You know why the president and the first lady don't want to talk about this?</p><p>KIRBY: Why is that?</p><p>IMUS: Or why the president doesn't care about how food is processed? Because every time you see them they got a hamburger in their hand. Every time you see the president and first lady they're at some hamburger joint. I mean, they've got -- my wife is saying that's got to be -- I mean, you don't just snap snapshots of the president that are not rehearsed or not at least planned.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, I'd like to talk about the Obama's if I could, because on one hand I wrote a piece for \"Washington Post\" online outling what Obama had promised and this helped him win the Iowa caucuses taking a stance against these factory farms and he was doing pretty well, but then I wanted to ask myself a couple other questions after I wrote the piece, for example, under the Bush administration we fed cattle to cattle in three different ways, blood products are given to dairy cows as a formula, we feed restaurant scraps to cattle and we feed, believe it or not, chicken crap to cattle.</p><p>Now, we feed cattle to chickens and when they eat that feed, it spills into their litter. We have so much litter, we can't spread it as fertilizer so what do we do we feed it to our cows. Now, Mrs. Obama talks about her organic garden and how children need eat healthy lunches and everything, and they let the FDA permit the feeding of, starts with an \"S\" and ends in \"hit\" to our children. And if people think that's boring, then there's not much I can do about it.</p><p>IMUS: Let me say something to you and I'm going to speak quietly and slowly. The president, as every other politician who's ever run for anything, says all kind of stuff when they're running. They have no intention of honoring what -- any pledge they made during the campaign, none.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, if he were to honor...</p><p>IMUS: Name one who did.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, I can't.</p><p>IMUS: No, of course not. And Obama's no different, doesn't make him any worse or any better than anybody else. As Matt Taibbi pointed out, he's talked about a new -- for example, a new culture on Wall Street, The day he got elected, not the day that he was sworn in, the day he got elected, he called every crook he knew on Wall Street, Bob Rubin and Larry Summers and Geithner and the rest of these clowns.</p><p>So no, they have no interest in this. So, my question, and Charles -- talking to Charles about this last night -- so, how do we get people -- because I (INAUDIBLE) talked to (INAUDIBLE), there's a smart guy. You can't get-- nobody wants to hear about this and they don't want to hear about the horror stories about how this -- these products were processed. So, my question for you is, is it possible to meet the demand, the commercial demand for meat and poultry and all of that stuff in this country, the McDonald's, KFC, in a more humane way, to raise the animals more humanely, to slaughter them more humanely? Is that possible?</p><p>KIRBY: Absolutely, we just need more farmers. Two percent of the population produces 100 percent of the food. What if we doubled that? We have a jobs crisis in this country, why not let young people and young families get into farming and make the rules more fair, get rid of the subsidies for the grain that we feed these animals. Put a ban on antibiotic use unless you're treating a sick animal. Make sure that producers can get their animals to the market through humane and regional processing plants. We don't have any of those things in this country and those are the types of things that Obama ran on.</p><p>IMUS: That sound like a generational thing, doesn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: But, can a family farm, a family farmer actually make money, can they get by now.</p><p>KIRBY: Oh, absolutely. Yes, grass fed, pasture fed...</p><p>IMUS: Who owns these factory farms? Tyson chicken, those people?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, they contract with individual farmers who own the debt and the manure, the companies own the animals and they basically pay these people to babysit the animals until they grow up.</p><p>IMUS: So the animals are raised, slaughtered this way because it's cheaper to do? Must be.</p><p>KIRBY: It's much cheaper and it's more profitable for the companies. The problem comes...</p><p>IMUS: And yet, on the other hand, it causes a catastrophic health care cost.</p><p>KIRBY: Catastrophic, and I was not even aware how bad it is. In addition to feeding chicken crap it our cows, a brand new report that came out on Friday, as bad reports always do, not getting a lot of coverage in the media on residue program for cattle in this country and this is a USDA document, and they said that the USDA, it's from the inspector general -- is not doing its job and they found in our beef drugs, heavy metals and pesticides. These all come from the factory farm setting.</p><p>IMUS: What are you eating, Bernard (ph)? What are you having?</p><p>MCCORD: Eggs and bacon.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>IMUS: And you're sitting there talking about feeding chicken crap to chickens and cows and then you wonder why you can't get on any of these programs? What, have you lost your mind?</p><p>(CROSSTALK).</p><p>IMUS: And he's over there, he's got his head phones off, I'm looking at him and Bernard's a smart guy, he's got his head phones off and eating bacon and eggs and Bernard reads everything. Would you read \"Animal Factory,\" Bernard.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would give it a look.</p><p>IMUS: You would?</p><p>MCGUIRK: You know, I'm -- well, maybe it would go on the back burner, I don't know I'm not sure.</p><p>IMUS: Why people -- I'm not sure I'd read it. I mean, I'm trying to get you to read it, but I have a really weak stomach (INAUDIBLE)...</p><p>MCCORD: No, I know you do.</p><p>KIRBY: But this is not, again, just about all the terrible things that happen at these factory farms, it's about people who are defending their communities, bringing in greater regulations and more enforcement and promoting an alternative way of raising animals in this country in a way that is humane and sustainable and can produce affording food that's healthy.</p><p>And again, if you're not interested in the pollution, if you're not interested in the animal rights, if you're not interested in what's happening to people who live near these facilities, this is a catalog of horrors of the stuff that we put in the feed that these animals eat and the residue that's left behind: arsenic, copper, antibiotics, these can cues nural toxicity, the can cause developmental delays, they can cause a whole host of illnesses and this is in our food that we're feeding to our children.</p><p>MCCORD: When they're spread on these acres of land, nothing they have nothing else to do with the animal waste, the heavy metals, particularly, go into the soil and remain there forever, they cannot being removed.</p><p>KIRBY: I've seen crop land where you can't plant anything because the hog waste has so much copper and zinc in it. And copper in our beef is a real problem. And you know, I know this is, we're on a business channel on the news, this is a massive business story and it's not getting reported. Swine flu...</p><p>IMUS: Oh, you're not going to get -- do you think that Cavuto is going to put you on? What are you, crazy?</p><p>KIRBY: Well, you know, I went on CNBC a while ago...</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well they suck.</p><p>KIRBY: ...about a year ago, because the swine flu, about a year ago came out, I went on and they reported that this was hurting the hog industry, it's cost the hog industry a billion dollars.</p><p>IMUS: And that's their angle. If you tried to get on like Jon Stewart or Colbert or any of those shows?</p><p>KIRBY: Yeah, I have. Colbert had the same response as NPR and Stewart we haven't heard back from.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, no...</p><p>KIRBY: There's funny stuff in here. I mean we have crap bubbles in Indiana...</p><p>IMUS: You're not going to get on those shows because they're not going to whale on somebody unless it's safe to do that.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: And it's not safe to whale on factory farms and these huge conglomerates, but -- and what we're saying, and what I think you're saying is, and it sounds contradictory, but you're not saying don't eat meat or don't eat poultry or any other...</p><p>KIRBY: Of course not.</p><p>IMUS: What you're saying is that we don't have a happy little pigs and chickens and cows running around the old barnyard anymore, that's not what's happening.</p><p>KIRBY: But we can go back to at least partially getting our food from that way and I think eventually we're going to have to get rid of these factory farms altogether because of these diseases, because of what's in the food, because of things like swine flu and MRSA, it's very important that people know where their food comes from.</p><p>IMUS: Not only the diseases that the animals contract, in fact, Deidre told me that the 70 percent of the world's antibiotics are consumed by animals.</p><p>KIRBY: Yes, they are. In this country and farmers can go to the feed store and buy...</p><p>IMUS: The other 30 percent, by the way, are consumed by me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You were saying?</p><p>KIRBY: They can go to the feed store and buy antibiotics without a prescription, they can buy it by the barrel full.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I wish people would read your book, you know, \"Animal Factory,\" I mean, it's wonderfully well written and researched and I know you worked hard on it.</p><p>MCCORD: It's heart of the message that is so important in that dadgum (ph) book is that alternatives exist.</p><p>KIRBY: Absolutely. I mean, there is a positive message to this whole story, it's that it doesn't have to be this way. And it is changing. Demand for organic food growth by 20 percent every year. People are starting to learn they don't want drugs and metals and pesticides in their food especially for their children. And by the way, I am going around the country and in local markets the media has been very, very responsive and very interested and I actually do a lot of interviews even here in New York City I did WNYC and WOR radio...</p><p>IMUS: Yeah, but you got to get on something -- I mean, we can sell books here, one of the few places, but you got to get -- you know, you're not getting on Oprah, she's the last, or she's a nice lady and all of that, I suppose.</p><p>KIRBY: Certainly.</p><p>IMUS: But she's the last person on earth that's going to get on this crusade.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, \"Oprah\" magazine did do a Q&amp;A with me in the April issue, so that was helpful.</p><p>IMUS: Except for that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>That's a step. Good for Oprah on that one.</p><p>KIRBY: There's a lot of money in advertising animal products and I think the advertisers are concerned about this getting on, too, because they're afraid when people find out where the food comes from they are going to buy alternatives and alternatives are available.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, it doesn't have to happen overnight, but I come back to, I mean, if I don't want it know about it, and I don't eat meat and I don't eat fish or chicken (INAUDIBLE), and who does? I mean, I talk to people they don't want to know about it.</p><p>KIRBY: Why won't people acknowledge where their food comes from? It just seems very important.</p><p>IMUS: Oh no, I agree with you and Charles.</p><p>KIRBY: And you know, I can understand that. When I see stories about the nuclear proliferation, I get so scared...</p><p>IMUS: Charles goes down to the diner, there where he lives, that big mansion he has out there.</p><p>MCCORD: Yeah.</p><p>IMUS: And has a turkey club sandwich...</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, I do. You bet.</p><p>IMUS: But you don't know...</p><p>MCCORD: But, I would rather know where it came from and that the turkey was a happy little bird.</p><p>IMUS: Oh. And here is another thing.</p><p>MCCORD: What?</p><p>IMUS: Getting into parallel universe stuff here, also, and I believe that you take on the karma of the tormented turkey.</p><p>MCCORD: I understand.</p><p>IMUS: The tormented tortured turkey.</p><p>MCCORD: That's why I'm miserable.</p><p>IMUS: That's force fed chicken feces.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, god.</p><p>IMUS: Well, if we have any listeners left this morning out there, we could count them on one hand, but I hope, I hope we can sell this for you. I hope you can sell it.</p><p>KIRBY: Well, thanks, Don, I think it's an important story.</p><p>IMUS: Also, you ought to get a Pulitzer Prize for this. I'm -- that's what you ought to get. Of course, this, when \"Silent Spring,\" Rachel Carson's book came out, nobody wanted to read it. No one. Nearly ran around the country had no interest, they thought she was insane. So, same could be said for you. We happen to know you are insane, and you're right about that.</p><p>KIRBY: My next book is going to be on puppies or something.</p><p>IMUS: Anyway, David Kirby, buy the book this morning, I mean, here's what you do, you buy the book and just put it on the coffee table and somebody walks in say, well yeah, I read that. \"Animal Factory,\" David Kirby from St. Martin's Press. Go to BarnesAndNoble.com, go to Amazon, go someplace, buy this thing. Thanks, David.</p><p>KIRBY: Thanks, Don.</p><p>IMUS: Thanks for grossing us all out.

Is it going to come to that?</p><p>SHIEFFER: Well, I would suppose not. I thought about that. I mean, you know, when -- well, I don't know, I don't think so. I don't think he's going to resign, but you know, I'm always reluctant to criticize somebody's religion or the church.</p><p>I'm a great respecter of the Catholic Church. I mean, they really were the kind of the crucible, the place where knowledge and scholarship, that's where it was all through the Dark Ages and so forth and the Catholic Church, along with Judaism, is really where all our Western values came from and we're the product of those values, but it's just heartbreaking to see something like the church is going through right now and I mean, basically what I said was that the church and its leaders have to put their reason for being ahead of the survival of their leaders and right now, they do not appear to be doing that and until they do, I think their church is going to remain at risk.</p><p>People will seek God in many ways, but never in a way that puts their own children at risk and I think -- I think the church is at risk, right now.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep is here on the FOX Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments. Then tonight at 6:00 Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, former New York City mayor, Ed Koch. Ed Koch. Tomorrow on this program we'll be joined by Anthony Mason, CBS News and Mary and Carol Higgins Clark. Oh, god. And they've got two new books. That's great. And then Jerry Springer's going to be here to talk about his new game show.</p><p>DON IMUS, HOST: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of J.P. Morgan rising in the pre-market after the bank reports better than expected numbers. It continued to see stabilization in delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. It's also seeing broad- based improvements and its hopeful for a strong economic recovery. The company expects to add 9,000 employees in the U.S. as we take a look at the stock moving higher in the pre-market.</p><p>Overseas markets rising on that and also some positive news from Intel last night. The company kicking off earnings season for tech companies in a big way. Shares jumping as much as 4 percent after a profit in that quarter nearly quadrupled. Intel says it got a lift from sales of new chips for computer servers. That's the type of purchase companies have been holding off on during the recession.</p><p>And Toyota will stop selling its Lexus GX460 after \"Consumer Reports\" saying people shouldn't buy it. The company asking dealers to pull the SUV until it can do its own tests. The magazine says the SUV has an unusually high risk of rolling over. This problem reportedly has to do with the electronic stability control, not the breaks or gas pedals that's related to the massive recall for Toyota. Toyota shares were trading lower yesterday in the market.</p><p>Also, some other breaking news this morning. At least 400 people killed, many more feared dead as a series of earthquakes rocks western China. Ten thousand more are injured according to state TV and local reports say many remain buried under rubble. The initial quake had a magnitude of 6.9 and was followed by several other very strong aftershocks. Charles McCord will have more on this story a little later on in the show.</p><p>All right, a quick look at the markets, though, as we head into Wednesday's session. The European markets trading up and looking like they're gaining some speed. If we take a look at our U.S. stock futures, we have been trading higher for most of the morning.</p><p>You have more IMUS IN THE MORNING here on the Fox Business Networkcoming to you next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I asked Jenna a few minutes ago, I said, where's Connell? Just curious.</p><p>CHARLES MCCORD, IMUS SHOW: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So she thinks that that means -- believe me, if we had our way about it, we'd have Jenna here all the time.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: We like -- Connell's fine, but, I mean, come on, we're not stupid. So -- but immediately she cops an attitude. So.</p><p>MCCORD: What do you mean?</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean she's</p><p>MCCORD: I didn't hear the exchange.</p><p>IMUS: She's very sensitive, aren't you?</p><p>MCCORD: Oh.</p><p>LEE: Well, I told you specifically because you e-mailed me to tell Connell hello. And I said -- and it was ironic because Connell e-mailed me to tell you hello. And so what I said is that if you two want it exchange love messages, you should e-mail each other directly.</p><p>MCCORD: That's a good point.</p><p>IMUS: No, no, you had e-mailed me -- by the way</p><p>LEE: Complimenting you on a wonderful article in Crane's (ph) about you.</p><p>IMUS: OK.</p><p>LEE: That you asked me to read.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>IMUS: Five minutes after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>We're sitting here talking about -- with Carl Jeffers (ph) from Sling Blade and Reverend Jesse Jackson about -- and Charles, Bernie and Lou and Jenna and everybody else, about David Kirby's book, \"Animal Factory.\" And Charles just looked at me and he said, he's not going to get on anything because look at the advertising on all of these programs, including ours.</p><p>MCCORD: Sure.</p><p>IMUS: It's fast food, it's restaurants and pharmaceuticals.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean you watch the evening news, it's all pharmaceuticals. But the difference is I'm -- and it makes my wife crazy, but I'm not anti-fast food joints or the pharmaceutical industry. Taking all the drugs that I've taken in my life, why would I be?</p><p>MCCORD: Of course, you're a supporter.</p><p>IMUS: I would be a huge supporter of that. But McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, to select a couple, are in they don't care. They'll do whatever -- they'll do whatever they need to do to get you to buy the stuff.</p><p>MCCORD: To get you in that store.</p><p>IMUS: When people said they wanted salads, McDonald's started serving salads.</p><p>MCCORD: Absolutely.</p><p>IMUS: When they want healthier stuff, they start -- that's fine with them. They don't care. When people started woofing on fried chicken, Kentucky Fried -- they started serving grilled chicken. They doesn't care. So if you -- so if the public demands an end to these horrific conditions that these animals are raised and slaughtered in, it will -- it's fine -- it will be fine with McDonald's or it will be fine with KFC. What do they care?</p><p>MCCORD: And the question I had, does that</p><p>IMUS: And if it costs more, it will cost you more.</p><p>MCCORD: The question I had, and is answered in Mr. Kirby's book, is that, yes, there are alternatives that exist now.</p><p>IMUS: But the money that everybody's going to save, including the country, is on health care costs.</p><p>MCCORD: That's true.</p><p>IMUS: Which are astronomical because of the stuff that's making folks sick. So, that's enough about it.</p><p>Meanwhile --</p><p>BERNARD MCGUIRK, IMUS SHOW: Not really.</p><p>IMUS: And -- not really what?</p><p>MCCORD: Not really enough.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Please, elaborate.</p><p>IMUS: And while we were talking to Kirby, Bernie was sitting there eating - - I love you, Bernie. Bernie's sitting there eating bacon and eggs, weren't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: And loving every second of it.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, you bet. It's delicious.</p><p>IMUS: Yes. And yet, if they treated your dog like they treated the pig that made that bacon thing for you this morning, you'd murder the person doing it, wouldn't you?</p><p>MCGUIRK: I would. I would indeed. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Well, bingo.</p><p>What's the big news story, quake in China?</p><p>MCCORD: Yes, that is the still breaking news of this hour is watching the aftermath of this 6.8 magnitude earthquake in China. And 400 people are known to have died about, maybe as many as 10,000 are homeless and a lot of those people are hurt and they expect that the casualty count will go higher, I-man.</p><p>And a good news story out of the state of Florida where that little girl, 11 years old, had been missing for four days in the swamp area near Winter Spring. Densely wooded and alligator infested and all like that. And a fella found her yesterday and she is safe.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, well, thank God.</p><p>Jenna's here. And Connell was on last hour and he thinks that we like you better than him. Isn't that ridiculous?</p><p>LEE: That's hysterical.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, yes, I mean it's just --</p><p>LEE: I know how much you like him.</p><p>IMUS: Well, of course. So, what's coming up in business?</p><p>LEE: Well, the markets are headed higher this morning. We did get some positive results from JP Morganthat came out with their quarterly results this morning.</p><p>We're also going to get some data in about 20 minutes on the consumer, Consumer Price Index, which is going to tell us whether or not our dollar is getting us more or less these days. Also, retail sales are out and that's going to be important to the market as well.</p><p>And speaking of shopping, interesting, last night, or yesterday, a very important artifact of American history actually was bought at an auction. This is the flight plan for Apollo 11, where Neil Armstrong, obviously, the first man who walked on the moon. And this flight plan had inscribed on it, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind,\" which is actually what he said. We often misquote him. It sold for $152,000, that flight plan.</p><p>IMUS: Why did the flight plan have that written on it?</p><p>LEE: Well, he -- I think he inscribed it afterwards, but</p><p>IMUS: I wonder -- oh, he did?</p><p>LEE: Yes, he wrote -- he wrote it on the flight plan. And often we say, you know, \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\"</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: That's actually not what he said.</p><p>IMUS: What did he say?</p><p>LEE: He said, \"one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.\"</p><p>IMUS: He doesn't want to talk about it now, you know?</p><p>LEE: Yes. Well, that's why I thought you'd be interested in it.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>LEE: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Hey, Bernie.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Probably no chance of getting him on the program, is there? Well, how do you know unless you ask?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, we'll effort the man.</p><p>IMUS: Why don't do you that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Sure. We'll make amends. He'll probably open up about his walking on the moon now.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, we'll just see if he -- yes, I want him to tell me he doesn't want to talk about it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, you want to ambush the old hero.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's very nice.</p><p>IMUS: That would be fun, don't you think?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Oh, yes. Definitely.</p><p>IMUS: Jenna will be on throughout the hour. Dagen McDowell is coming up. Scott Salado (ph), our New York reporter, thinks that Dagen and her husband had a big spat and that Rollo (ph) --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: His name is not Rollo.</p><p>MCCORD: No, not Rollo, no.</p><p>IMUS: It's a --</p><p>MCCORD: Jonas. Jonas.</p><p>IMUS: Jonas left the house last night and was out stomping around in New York.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, maybe walking over that gravel he spread last weekend. We'll find out.</p><p>Sports coming up with Warner Wolf.</p><p>The Yankees won their home opener, huh, Warner?</p><p>WARNER WOLF, IMUS SHOW: Yes, they did, I-man, and then handed out the rings. And Hideki Matsui, the ex-Yankee, got the biggest hand of all. Bulls General Manager John Paxson apparently challenged Bull's Coach Vinny Del Negro to a fight. Dolphins get Bronco's all-pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Hurray for Jim Nantz for publicly criticizing Tiger Woods foul language at The Masters. And</p><p>IMUS: Why wasn't Jim Nantz criticizing Tiger Woods' foul language when Tiger was winning all those tournaments before he got into all that trouble.</p><p>WOLF: Ah-hah.</p><p>IMUS: See, I had no idea. Lupica never told me. Well, because I never asked him. But I had no idea that Tiger was as big a jerk as he is because I used to talk about --</p><p>MCCORD: How much fun it was. Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I mean, I -- I mean, I don't play golf. I don't -- you know. The only thing I like about golf is the Great River Golf Club. I get to drive around in the cart for the Imus Ranch Golf Outing. But other than that, I</p><p>MCGUIRK: But you use to watch golf when Tiger played, right?</p><p>IMUS: Yes, and cheer for Tiger not knowing that he was a jerk.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But it was on TV. He acted like a jerk publicly. It's just that everybody</p><p>IMUS: Well, I never noticed any of that.</p><p>WOLF: Nor did I.</p><p>IMUS: And Warner's one of the premier sports casters in America and he didn't notice it. If Warner Wolf doesn't notice it, how am I supposed to? I'm just a casual fan.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Got to wake the hell up then.</p><p>IMUS: Well, you're right about that, but I didn't know that he was throwing his clubs and swearing at people and being icky to the fans.</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: I had no idea. Well, where was Nantz when all that was going on?</p><p>WOLF: Conspiracy.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was with you. Sleeping.</p><p>IMUS: So, now that it's safe to kick Tiger --</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Now he's kicking him. That's weak. Really, that is weak.</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Lame.</p><p>IMUS: Nantz is -- I love Nantz, and he's a very good friend of mine, but he's a pansy. And he knows he is.</p><p>WOLF: Well, maybe he's had enough. That's it.</p><p>IMUS: Maybe he has had enough.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Twelve minutes after the hour. Warner will have a bunch of sports. Bernard McGuirk will have the \"Bernie Briefing\" sponsored by P.C. Richard &amp; Son. Fifty-seven gorgeous stories, 100 years. Still run by the family. If you know what I knew, you wouldn't buy anything any place else, including a shirt. Well, they don't sell shirts, but you know what I mean.</p><p>MCCORD: But if they did.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>What's up in the briefing, Bernie?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Miami basketball star all star game MVP -- Miami Heat, Dwyane Wade.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: He was -- he was at a Manhattan club in the meat packing district just recently and Carmine Gotti, remember from that stupid show, \"Growing up Gotti,\" growing up snotty, whatever you want to call it. He wanted today meet Dwyane Wade and Dwyane said -- reportedly said, according to \"The New York Post,\" \"there's no way I'm meeting the Gottis or having my photo taken with them.\" Anyway, he left. Their bodyguards got into a fight. Carmine was upset. And, but, anyway, good for Dwyane Wade. He didn't want to meet the little -- the punk who makes the kids -- the kids on the Jersey shore look like the Brady Bunch.</p><p>IMUS: Right.</p><p>MCGUIRK: But -- and Conan O'Brien is pushing George Lopez's show on TBS. By the way, did you know he had a show on TBS? Did anybody know?</p><p>IMUS: I did, yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: At 11 p.m.</p><p>IMUS: Because I watch basketball, so.</p><p>MCGUIRK: All right. Well, it's being pushed back --</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't watch basketball. I watch Charles Barclay. Different. Yes, I knew. Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, right, but it wasn't getting much traction. So, anyways</p><p>IMUS: Well, it got (ph) no traction.</p><p>MCGUIRK: None at all. And so Conan's coming in. He's getting pushed back to midnight. People are saying</p><p>IMUS: What?</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's getting -- Lopez is getting pushed back to midnight by Conan.</p><p>IMUS: He is?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, he is.</p><p>IMUS: Wow!</p><p>MCGUIRK: Conan's 11:00 and now they're going to put Lopez on at midnight. And some people are saying he's getting dissed. He's getting the Conan treatment. The treatment that Conan got at NBC, he's getting now, ironically, by Conan and TBS.</p><p>IMUS: Well, the story that they're circulating is, that in order to close the deal --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: George Lopez actually called Conan.</p><p>MCCORD: He's good with all of that, yes.</p><p>IMUS: And talked him into doing this.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: And is fine with all of it and all that.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes, sure. Right.</p><p>IMUS: I mean</p><p>MCGUIRK: But, anyway, Chris Rock and -- was on the Lopez tonight show last night and they talked about it and here's a little piece of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE LOPEZ, \"THE GEORGE LOPEZ SHOW\": I think you're here on a good night.</p><p>CHRIS ROCK: Yes.</p><p>LOPEZ: I couldn't think of a better guest to be here.</p><p>ROCK: There's no bad nights on \"The George Lopez Show.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: That's funny.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LOPEZ: But with Conan coming to TBS.</p><p>ROCK: Yes, yes. Conan's coming?</p><p>LOPEZ: Yes.</p><p>ROCK: And where are you going?</p><p>LOPEZ: I'm going -- I'm staying. I'm going to midnight. He's coming at 11:00 and I'm going to midnight.</p><p>ROCK: Get the hell out of here. So you're going to move for the white man, huh?</p><p>LOPEZ: I am. I am. Hey</p><p>ROCK: I hope he appreciates this.</p><p>LOPEZ: I think the white man does appreciate it very much.</p><p>ROCK: OK. And you don't got to clean a park or nothing, right?</p><p>LOPEZ: No.</p><p>ROCK: OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: No. And I get to go to work an hour later.</p><p>ROCK: OK. OK.</p><p>LOPEZ: That's a Latino dream come true, to go to work later.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCGUIRK: Get the hell out of here! Anyway, that happened last night. Enjoying that politically incorrect humor is always refreshing. And so Lopez apparently cool with it and everybody's happy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Except the I-man.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I mean, it's fine.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Did you just eat a lemon or</p><p>IMUS: No, they're just two unfunny schmucks. No. So, whatever.</p><p>Here's Chuck with a little news.</p><p>Charles.</p><p>MCCORD: At least 400 people dead, thousands injured, others buried beneath the rubble after this series of strong earthquakes we reported in western China. The Tibetan plateau area. Wood homes collapsed. People in the streets looking for safety, look for relatives. The U.S. Geological Survey said the main quake was 6.9 and there have been aftershocks in the 5.2 area.</p><p>Then in India, police say a cyclone diminished thousands of huts, uprooted trees in several villages in eastern India and at least 68 people are dead as a result of that.</p><p>And then the story out of Florida today. The good news story. The little girl's voice on the 911 call, faint by cheerful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NADIA BLOOM: Hi. Hi. Yes, I'm the girl that got lost.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCCORD: And there you go. That is 11-year-old Nadia Bloom.</p><p>IMUS: How long was she missing?</p><p>MCCORD: Four days all alone out in an extraordinarily densely --</p><p>IMUS: Oh my God. Man.</p><p>MCCORD: Dense area of the swamp. Took people three hours to carry her out of the area. And there was a fellow who was a member of her church who said he actually did get a divinely inspired message of where this little girl would be. Went to there. Fought his way through. Actually had to go through with machetes and found her alive and they got her out.</p><p>IMUS: Here's the problem, Bernie, with the Chris Rock, George Lopez bit. It actually was funny the first time I heard it.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: So, and I just forgot to -- I just forgot to program myself --</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: To pretend I hadn't heard it before.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Right, that was two hours ago.</p><p>IMUS: It was two hours ago and, by the way, it's remarkable that I remembered that it was on two hours ago. Well, why wouldn't George Lopez, who is, who can be funny, why -- why wouldn't he want this? Why not?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, because, you know, he's not the -- he's not the man any more. He's not the alpha male at TBS.</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, but he wasn't going to be the man anyway.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Well, that's true. I mean, in a sense, he should welcome it because it's going to bring him some attention and maybe some ratings.</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Because he was sort of floundering and faltering.</p><p>IMUS: So it's good for everybody.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Seventeen after the hour. One of my five favorite Dwight Yoakam songs of all time. This was his first hit.</p><p>IMUS: This is the IMUS IN THE MORNING program. Time now for a business update. From the Fox Business Network, here's Jenna Lee.</p><p>LEE: Good morning, everybody. Here's your \"Fox Business Minute.\"</p><p>Shares of JP Morganrising in the pre-market after the bank reports better than expected earnings. JP Morgancontinues to see stabilization and delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. The company seeing broad- based improvements and is hopeful for a strong economic recovery. CEO Jamie Dimon says he does not know if regulators will allow the company to boost the dividend now.</p><p>President Obama meeting with congressional leaders from both parties at the White House today to talk about financial regulation reform. Treasury Secretary Geithner saying, quote, \"Republicans won't want to be on the wrong side of this,\" but Republican Mitch McConnell saying the Democrat's plan won't solve any problems and will provide endless protection for banks.</p><p>Big banks fighting against some tough derivative rules now. Goldman Sachs, JP Morganand Morgan Stanley telling the Senate Agriculture Committee stricter rules will limit profits. The Agriculture Committee can submit a different proposal for reform than the Banking Committee already has. But the committee chairman, Blanche Lincoln, is expected to propose a more aggressive approach with sweeping changes to the derivatives market. So we'll watch that play out.</p><p>A quick look at futures now as we hand it over to Charles for this morning's other top stories.</p><p>MCCORD: And a developing story this morning. The China earthquake. China struggling with the aftermath of a major quake. This time a magnitude 6.9 jolt in the far western Tibetan plateau area. Officials report at least 400 people dead, more than 10,000 injured. And police are digging through the rubble of homes. There have been a number of aftershocks.</p><p>Then, to India, where police say a cyclone demolished thousands of huts and uprooted trees there. Several villages involved in eastern India. And they say at least 68 people have died as a result of that.</p><p>President Obama calling the commitments from the two day nuclear security conference, Washington, at once bold and pragmatic, promising to follow up on the results, including a progress summit in two years.</p><p>And then, up to 10,000 people expected as Sarah Palin addresses another Tea Party rally today. This time, Boston. Next to last event at a Tea Party Express tour that wraps tomorrow in Washington.</p><p>Those are some of the headlines stories as the IMUS IN THE MORNING program continues right here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: Twenty-four after the hour here on the IMUS IN THE I'm coughing as nobody's taking a (INAUDIBLE) for me. But, anyway, what would you do if I died, just sit there?</p><p>LOU RUFINO, IMUS SHOW: No, everybody's just --</p><p>MCCORD: No, that's when -- that's when --</p><p>IMUS: No, what would you do? I'm kind of curious.</p><p>MCCORD: That's when the rockets (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>IMUS: What would you do? If I suddenly keeled over dead, would you just sit there?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Dance.</p><p>MCCORD: Ad the confetti.</p><p>IMUS: And dead air. I'm dead and there's dead air? Is that what happens for the rest of the morning?</p><p>MCCORD: Probably so.</p><p>RUFINO: Knowing you, you'd wake up and go, this is what happens when I die. This is what you'll get.</p><p>IMUS: I'm coughing and he just sits there. All of them.</p><p>MCGUIRK: It's a party in the USA.</p><p>IMUS: This portion of the IMUS IN THE MORNING program sponsored by Robotic Urology.</p><p>RUFINO: I don't see him moving, Chuck.</p><p>IMUS: So, we're talking about \"Animal Factory.\" David Kerby's book from St. Martins Press. Bit time publisher, big time book. The guy had a huge \"New York Times\" best seller with \"Evidence of Harm,\" about Thimerosal in these vaccines.</p><p>MCCORD: Right.</p><p>IMUS: \"Animal Factory.\" What number is it at Barnes &amp; Noble, Bigfoot?</p><p>TOM BOWMAN, IMUS SHOW: Barnes &amp; Noble right now, it's moving up. It's number 41,477.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes.</p><p>BOWMAN: And on Amazon it's 10, 994. So, I mean, the good news is, it can only go up from here, right?</p><p>IMUS: Well, no, there are books that are lower than 41,000 on BNN and lower than, of course, 10,000 on Amazon. But --</p><p>MCCORD: What about number 41,400 and what is it, 78 is? One beneath it.</p><p>RUFINO: How to cook a great steak.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: I don't know. But, I mean, it's got to be --</p><p>MCCORD: Oh, man.</p><p>IMUS: Warner, you eat meat, don't you?</p><p>WOLF: Yes. Not that much, though. A hamburger. That's about it.</p><p>IMUS: Do you care how the cow was raised or slaughtered for that burger?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: Not at all?</p><p>WOLF: No.</p><p>IMUS: So you don't care about how the animals are treated?</p><p>WOLF: Well, sure, but I don't think about it when I order a hamburger.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go. That's --</p><p>IMUS: So that's -- but you do care about it.</p><p>WOLF: Oh, yes.</p><p>IMUS: You just don't think about it?</p><p>WOLF: Right.</p><p>IMUS: So, well, think about it next time. Do you have -- do you have any pets?</p><p>WOLF: Yes, two dogs. Two Jack Russells.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, really?</p><p>WOLF: Uh-huh.</p><p>IMUS: How would you feel if we treated your Jack Russells like they treat these cows?</p><p>WOLF: Terrible.</p><p>RUFINO: No, you lost.</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's -- there's a better way to do it. I'm saying, you can still have your hamburger, but there's a better way to do it.</p><p>WOLF: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: Don't want to hear about it, do you?</p><p>RUFINO: No one wants --</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody --</p><p>RUFINO: Nobody wants to hear about how</p><p>MCCORD: Nobody wants to hear about --</p><p>WOLF: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCGUIRK: Just want to get through the day.</p><p>IMUS: So I'll just stop talking about it.</p><p>RUFINO: (INAUDIBLE) nothing left to eat. Man. Geez. I want to eat something, Warner (ph).</p><p>IMUS: No, no, you can eat what I eat. You can have a radish and this bag of nuts. That's what you can have.</p><p>RUFINO: What is that, the hungry man meal?</p><p>MCGUIRK: There's people starving in Haiti, for God's sakes.</p><p>IMUS: And they're talking about how they need all these factory farms to meet the food supply. They're not meeting the -- the food demands. They're not meeting the food demands. There are 12 million kids in this country go to bed hungry every night. Could be more than that, actually. Look at the number of people around the world who are starving. So they're not meeting the food demand at all, are they? Please. God, please shut up. I'm begging you. I'm even telling myself, just please shut up.</p><p>RUFINO: Just let him go and he'll stop.</p><p>IMUS: It's 27 after the hour. We're already late for <person><nameText>Tom Friedman. </nameText></person>Quickly, just give me the couple of big sports stories. Then we'll go to Dagen. Then we'll get to Tom.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, we're hungry, come on.</p><p>IMUS: Here's Warner.</p><p>WOLF: All right. Yankees win. The Mets lost. John Maine lasted only three innings, seven hits, eight --</p><p>IMUS: And a -- let me have an extra sausage patty.</p><p>RUFINO: Yes, come on, three more. Pile it on.</p><p>WOLF: The Dolphins have just acquired Bronco's all pro wide receiver Brandon Marshall. And the big NBA story, two weeks ago, Bulls General Manager John Paxson charged into the office of Bulls Coach Vinny Del Negro, grabbed him by the tie, poked him in the chest and challenged him to a fight because of Del Negro's use of Joakim Noah, who had a bad foot.</p><p>And that's it. On the tree tops.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Thank you very much, Warner.</p><p>Time for a little business news. From Fox Business Network, here's Dagen McDowell.</p><p>Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, sir.</p><p>IMUS: Poor Scott Salado thinks that you and your husband had this huge fight and old Rollo was out there walking around in the yard, or Jonas, out there walking around in the yard, tromping on the gravel he spread last weekend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I just spent the last hour trying to get him on the phone, cell phone, not answering, house phone, not answering. Finally got him on the phone and then he refreshed my memory what the fight was about. You know what? I was in the right, doggone it. The dog smelled like skunk. He didn't wan to get off his duff and wash him. And then he sassed me. So, there you go.</p><p>IMUS: Who sassed you, Rollo?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, he sassed me. Wouldn't wash the skunk smell off the dog and then he sassed me. Don't sass me. And, by the way, everybody bitches and moans about the wife, about the moods and she's so unpredictable. But you know what? When the wife takes charge and gets stuff done and when somebody's yapping on their cell phone on the train, it's the woman who tells him to shut up. Somebody cuts in line at the movie theater, it's the woman who tells them, get at the back of the line, buddy! You know what, so, it's a trade-off, isn't it?</p><p>MCGUIRK: Yes. Grow a pair.</p><p>IMUS: I'm choking to death here --</p><p>RUFINO: I'm scared.</p><p>IMUS: And nobody's going to talk to you unless it's me, so --</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>IMUS: I've got to go. I'm dying. But, thank you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I worry about you, man.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, do you have any business news?</p><p>MCGUIRK: That's one.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, you -- in 20 seconds, we're going to get retail sales and consumer prices out. That's what</p><p>IMUS: You're God damn nuts. That's -- here's -- what do you think?</p><p>MCCORD: You -- you -- well, why did you persist?</p><p>IMUS: Well, because my idiot wife, she says, \"Well, then take nuts.\" And I've tried to tell her a million times, you can't eat nuts if you're on the air. You can't eat them.</p><p>MCCORD: No, because they're dry and they irritate your throat.</p><p>What's the matter with you? You know that.</p><p>IMUS: Jesus Christ.</p><p>MCCORD: And you're eating a week's worth of nuts in one setting.</p><p>MCGUIRK: Talk about role reversals here.</p><p>MCCORD: Oh my God.</p><p>IMUS: It's just ridiculous.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You want me to cut in and rescue you?</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Consumer prices were up .1 of a percent in March. That's as expected. And the core is unchanged, which is a little bit lower than expected. So that's all good news. If you're going out to go shopping at the grocery store for any food --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Or nuts.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- or nuts -- I do worry about you, man. Somebody pat you on the back.</p><p>IMUS: That's fine. .</p><p>MCDOWELL: They're worried about you touching you, actually.</p><p>IMUS: Charles would sit there and watch me die and just go -- and be looking for the balloons to blow up.</p><p>MCCORD: That's it.</p><p>IMUS: All right. <person><nameText>Tom Friedman </nameText></person>is next.</p><p>This is one of <person><nameText>Tom Friedman's </nameText></person>favorite songs. I have no idea who it is or what it is, and I don't care.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>LEE: All right, everybody. We do have some breaking news now. Dagen just touched on it briefly.</p><p>The Consumer Price Index just in to us, a rise of .1 of a percent, the headline number. The core number, if you exclude those volatile food and energy prices, is unchanged, similar to January, where we saw that unchanged as well.</p><p>We were taking a look and seeing whether gas prices really were a factor here, and the number doesn't appear to be -- that was something we were looking at, to see if maybe there was a jump in the Consumer Price Index. It's something we were looking at as far as its factor in retail sales as well.</p><p>Retail sales are up 1.6 percent for March. That's also a little bit higher than expected. We were looking at 1.2 percent as the rise.</p><p>We have seen a drop in hourly wages, so we're taking a look to see if that was going to affect retail in March, which has been a very unpredictable month, in part because of the weather. But again, up for March.</p><p>Also, a little bit higher when we take out motor vehicle sales. The number was up .6 of a percent. That's a .1 of a percent higher than expected. It's the largest jump in retail sales that we've seen since November of 2009.</p><p>That's one of the headlines that's crossing at this time.</p><p>If we can, let's go ahead -- oh, we're already there. You beat me to it.</p><p>A look at stock futures right now. Take a look at -- oh, excuse me. I'm keep getting interrupted just because of some other breaking news at this time.</p><p>Apple just out with some breaking news, delaying the international launch of the iPad. We're going to take a look at some of the headlines that have to do with that and bring more details to you throughout the morning.</p><p>There's look at the stock again. This news hitting just right now, that Apple is postponing the international launch of the iPad by one month. Demand, Apple says, is far higher than predicted.</p><p>So we'll take a look at these headlines and be right back with more IMUS IN THE MORNING.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: I don't know if I'm really interested in you and the producer of \"The Jersey Boys\" trying to solve what's going on.</p><p>BO DIETL, BO DIETL &amp; ASSOCIATES: And Charlie Rose, one of the most prolific interviewers of all time. No, Charlie? My man Charlie. Well, in any case--</p><p>IMUS: Charlie Rose, the guy on PBS?</p><p>DIETL: Yes.</p><p>MCGUIRK: The two legged Ambien pill.</p><p>IMUS: The two legged -- Bernie describes him right, the two-legged Ambien pill.</p><p>DIETL: Oh, no. He's a very smart man.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCGUIRK: He's on public TV for a reason.</p><p>IMUS: That bus left the station a long time ago. That ship has sailed years ago.</p><p>DIETL: We're talking about the economy.</p><p>IMUS: Yes, he is. He's unlike me. He will not be getting his mojo back. That is not going to happen.</p><p>DIETL: He's right there.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LEE: Apple calling the iPad a runaway success. That's what they're saying this morning. Let's take a look at the Apple stock, which is moving in the pre-market on very strong volume on the news that Apple is delaying the launch of its iPad internationally because it's saying that, really, it can't keep up with demand.</p><p>So we're keeping an eye on this stock, raising one percent in the pre- market. Apple saying this morning that it has already delivered more than a half-million iPads during this first week. And again, it looks like stronger demand that it is prepared for, delaying the launch of the iPad internationally, and you can see the stock moving higher.</p><p>Back to more IMUS IN THE MORNING now.</p><p>IMUS: Here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program, on the radio all over the country, on the Fox Business Network, on more radio stations, doing better than we've ever done. And why? Because there's no God, that's why, Charles.</p><p>Please welcome from \"The New York Times\" a man who has one three Pulitzer Prizes.</p><p>MCCORD: There you go.</p><p>IMUS: <person><nameText>Tom Friedman.</nameText></person></p><p>Good morning, Mr. Friedman.</p><p><person><nameText>TOM FRIEDMAN, </nameText></person>\"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": Hey. Good morning, Don.</p><p>IMUS: You know, I was talking -- before we talk about your very fine column this morning on idealism versus realism, and Iraq and Afghanistan, if that's the proper way to describe it, when you wrote your green book, what was that called, \"Hot, Flat, and --</p><p>FRIEDMAN: \"Hot, Flat, and Crowded.\"</p><p>IMUS: Did you write about these animal factories?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: No.</p><p>IMUS: Why?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I don't know what you're talking about, Don. Sorry.</p><p>IMUS: Well, the animal factories are these huge, huge --</p><p>MCCORD: Huge installations that -- from which we derive almost all our food supplies now so far as poultry and dairy and meat is concerned. And hundreds of thousands of animals are involved, many times in a single place, and the way they're treated and the environmental consequences that derive from that.</p><p>IMUS: The environmental impact, health care impact --</p><p>MCCORD: It's huge.</p><p>IMUS: -- is catastrophic. And a friend of mine, David Kirby, who wrote \"Evidence of Harm,\" which was about thimerosal in vaccines -- of course, nobody wanted to talk about either --</p><p>MCCORD: No.</p><p>IMUS: -- has written this from St. Martin's Press. And he can't -- I had him on this morning, but he can't get -- nobody want to hear about it and nobody wants to talk about it, including, apparently, you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I'm sure it's important, and of all the different forms of environmental degradation going on there, I'm sure it's really important. It just was not on my radar screen. Something I'm sure worth looking into it, but it was not one of the things I was focussed on.</p><p>IMUS: Well, Google it when you get done with me.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: OK.</p><p>IMUS: Because you'll find that it's having a devastating impact on human society and the globe, and the environmental impact is catastrophic.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: The industrial slaughter of animals for food?</p><p>IMUS: Yes. Yes. The looming threat of industrial pig, dairy and poultry farms to -- anyway --</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Got you.</p><p>IMUS: This -- I can just tell now.</p><p>MCCORD: You can stop now.</p><p>IMUS: You've got a sausage burger in one hand and a bacon sandwich -- so now tell me about your column this morning, what's going on in Afghanistan.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, the point I was trying to make, Don, is simple that, you know, George Bush approached Afghanistan -- just to simplify it was to say, you know, let's keep things there to a bare minimum. You know, we'll keep Karzai in power, we really don't care what he and his cronies do to rip off the country. Just let our troops operate there and focus on tracking down al Qaeda guys in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and keeping them off balance.</p><p>And it was a very kind of realist or near-realist approach. You know, what matters is really our interests, tracking down these guys. We really don't care whether Afghanistan is a well-run country or a poorly-run country. That's an exaggeration, but that was the core approach.</p><p>Basically, what happened, though, was that Karzai's misgovernance reached such industrial proportions, that tens of thousands of Afghans turned away from him and said, you know, we actually prefer the Taliban back compared to these guys. And that was kind of when Obama came onto the scene.</p><p>Now, you remember during the campaign, Obama really criticized the Bush administration on Iraq and Afghanistan for focussing on values and whatnot, and not our core interests. But basically what Obama has done is flipped it, and his whole policy in Afghanistan is predicated on the point of we have got to clear the Taliban out, then once we do that, we've actually got to deliver good governance to the Afghan people. And only by doing that will they restore their allegiance to the government, join the army, and allow us to get out of Afghanistan without having to worry of al Qaeda coming back.</p><p>So, the thing I was pointing out was simply two things. One is, it's really interesting that Obama's now really pursuing a much more idealist, as opposed to sort of hard-core realist, foreign policy in Afghanistan and, by definition, in Iraq. And the corollary to that is -- you know, a lot of people criticize Obama for getting in Karzai's face about his corruption, to which I say, you know, you can't get in his face enough, especially if this is your policy. So, that was really what I was trying to point out.</p><p>IMUS: But if this is the Obama policy, then this is the dictionary definition of nation-building, isn't it?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Oh, yes. This is -- call it nation-building, Don, call it state-building, but that's exactly what it is.</p><p>And, you know, I think you and I talked right after the policy was announced. And the point I made is that, you know, the policy only works if a few things happen. One is if Obama actually does what he's saying he isn't doing, state-building, and if Pakistan really becomes a much more different country and takes on the Taliban inside.</p><p>You know, I think to Obama's credit, one thing that's happened -- and the reason people are feeling a lot better about Afghanistan, say, today than three or four months ago, is Pakistan really has taken on the Taliban inside and clearly shared a lot of intelligence with us. So, our Special Operations people and CIA people have been able to track down and eliminate or capture a lot of key Taliban leaders, and that's gone a little better.</p><p>Whether the situation on the ground, whether we can deliver -- you know, General McChrystal in Afghanistan -- I think he's a terrific guy -- calls it government in a box, which is basically, we clear out the Taliban and then we come, actually, with a box full of, metaphorically speaking, Afghan officials, and they provide good governance. That's what they tried in the first town they cleared, in Marjah. The next big test is Kandahar.</p><p>I think the jury is still really out whether that governance is delivering, but that is the strategy we've got in place. And I really was trying to write and then explain to people, that's what's at stake here. If that's what we're doing, this is what you better be rooting for -- one, better governance; and two, if Obama wants to get in Karzai's face, that's just fine with me.</p><p>IMUS: My head kind of was spinning though as I was watching Bob Schieffer on \"Face the Nation\" when Secretary Clinton and Secretary Gates were on and Schieffer said, well -- talking about Karzai -- he said, well, now he's been characterized by you all as a drug addict and a thug, and this and that. Well, they just scoffed at that and said, oh, no, he's -- so the line changed -- oh, no, he's terrific, and he's coming over and bringing these new capes and all that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, I don't quite buy it, Don.</p><p>IMUS: What was that all about?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I mean, Karzai is both the -- to me, the cause of the surge and the beneficiary of the surge. He's the cause of the surge because it was his misgovernance that allowed the Taliban to come back, and he's going to be the beneficiary of the surge.</p><p>But, basically, you know, it's the old story. If you owe the bank $1,00, that's your problem. If you owe them a million dollars, that's their problem.</p><p>He's the only horse we have to ride now. And therefore, these -- our senior officials simply are going to have to live with him. And to which, you know, I say OK, I understand that, I'm not naive about it, but don't let him take you hostage.</p><p>You know, he needs us just as much. And I just really resent that. When you want it more than they do, you always end up getting in trouble.</p><p>IMUS: Well, I don't see how -- even you acknowledge in your college this morning -- I don't see how this plan the president has for Afghanistan ever works. Ever.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: And this was my problem from the beginning, that, you know, it may work, Don, with infinite time and infinite money.</p><p>IMUS: But we don't have that.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, we have neither. And so that's what really troubles me about it.</p><p>But my attitude has been, look, I made my point earlier, I'm skeptical of this. But my country is in it now. We're in the middle of it, so I'm just focussed on, all right, we're in the middle of it. How do we think this through rationally? How do we get it to work, if at all? Because we're in the middle of it, and so that's really what I'm trying to apply my gray matter to.</p><p>IMUS: Why are we being so icky to Netanyahu?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, you know, I think what all of that was about, Don, is a couple of things. And in a way, there's an analog with the Karzai story.</p><p>I think what, you know, sort of Biden's blast at Netanyahu for announcing, you know, this new settlement project in Jerusalem when he was there, it wasn't just about, you know, this moment and that perceived slap in the face when Biden had actually come over to kind of make up with the Israelis and put things right. It was really about 40 years of Israeli officials misleading -- I would say cheating -- themselves and the world by constantly building settlements in a way that I don't think is in their interest. I know it's not in our interest.</p><p>And I think that Obama was really reflecting the anger of a lot of secretaries of state, a lot of presidents, that, you know, guys, this has got to stop. Because if it doesn't stop, there's no way we can actually produce, you know, a peace process. But more importantly, how are you going to remain a Jewish state if you permanently devouring more and more of the West Bank and ultimately absorbing their Arab-Palestinian population.</p><p>And so I'm all for red lines. I said in my column then, I said this morning, friends don't let friends drive drunk. And to me, you know, we've had way too many American presidents just kind of tolerating with the Israelis are doing there, which is bad for us and bad for them.</p><p>And when the United States comes to Israel and says look, guys, we have 200,000 troops in the Middle East right now, in Iraq and Afghanistan, they're not there for you, they're there for us. But their being there, actually, certainly helps you. It wiped out one of your biggest enemies, Saddam Hussein.</p><p>So, when we come to you and ask you for the smallest favor, which is, like, don't build any more settlements right now while we try to get a peace process going, which we think would improve the atmosphere in the region and help our troops, there's only one right answer to that question, and that is, yes, Mr. United States, we will do that. Thank you very much.</p><p>IMUS: In the 20 years or so that you've been appearing on this program, as we often touch on this subject -- and the conversation never changes, just the people. It never changes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: It's funny, Don, you know, I think one of the very first times I was on your show, which is 20 years ago, I had written \"Beirut to Jerusalem.\"</p><p>IMUS: Yes.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Which was my memoir of that time of the world. As our mutual agent Esther will tell you, the book is now about to reach its 20th year in paperback. And what happens when you have a paperback after 20 years, the license expires and it actually comes back to you.</p><p>And you cannot only sell the book, you can do whatever you want with it. So we're actually going to come out with a new edition in a year or so, and I've already decided it's going to have a new introduction. It's going to be one page, one line: \"Nothing has changed.\"</p><p>IMUS: You know, I know you didn't call up to be chastised by me, but I'm stunned that you can write a book on the environment and not assess the impact that our nation's food supply has on the way that these animals are treated, the way the food is prepared, the way it's presented, and the impact it has on not only the environment, but the health care of people in this country.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Well, there you go. I mean, I'm sure I missed a lot more than that, but I'm glad to know about it. And several people have written --</p><p>IMUS: This is an opportunity for you to get up to speed, isn't it, Tom?</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FRIEDMAN: I come on this show to be brought up to speed.</p><p>IMUS: In this case, you deserve it.</p><p>Thank you very much, Tom.</p><p>FRIEDMAN: Thanks, Don.</p><p>IMUS: <person><nameText>Tom Friedman </nameText></person>here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>LEE: Some breaking news this hour.</p><p>Apple delaying the international launch of the iPad. Fox Business the first to report to you that Apple is delaying the international launch of the iPad by one month due to strong demand.</p><p>That news driving the stock higher in the pre-market. And Apple saying the iPad has been a runaway success right here in the U.S. The company delivering more than a half-million iPads since its domestic launch. So we'll keep an eye on that stock today.</p><p>In the meantime, some economic news just in to us.</p><p>Inflation remaining tame in March. The Consumer Price Index rising by .1 of a percent, right in line with the estimate. When you take out food and energy, there's no change in prices compared to February, and this will likely allow the Fed to keep interest rates low.</p><p>We also got retail sales, up 1.6 percent in March, better than expected. A lot of that gain was due to strong auto sales. If you take out autos, you actually get the reading of .6 of a percent higher. That's also a bigger gain than economists were expecting.</p><p>And shares of JPMorgan rising in the pre-market as well after the bank reports better-than-expected earnings. It continues to see stabilization in delinquencies on consumer loans and mortgages. It's seeing broad-based improvements, and it's hopeful for a strong economic recovery. CEO Jamie Dimon says he doesn't know if regulators will allow JPMorgan to raise its dividends.</p><p>So we'll keep an eye on that stock.</p><p>Lots to keep an eye on this morning. Let's take a look at the European markets that picked up off that positive news from intel after the bell yesterday.</p><p>Trading higher this morning. As we take a look at our U.S. stock futures, we're seeing some green arrows on the screen as well. S&amp;P 500 up .4 of a percent.</p><p>And stay with us on Fox Business for \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Stuart Varney up at 9:20 Eastern Time.</p><p>In the meantime, you've got more IMUS IN THE MORNING coming to you next here on the Fox Business Network.</p><p>IMUS: All right. Six minutes until the hour here on the IMUS IN THE MORNING program.</p><p>That was probably the last time Friedman will be on, but -- I mean, that's crazy, isn't it?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, it's a little oversight.</p><p>IMUS: It has a greater impact on the health of people in this country than anything. More devastating to the environment than anything. Than anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: OK.</p><p>IMUS: And it wasn't on your radar?</p><p>MCCORD: Well, no, it wasn't on his radar. He had other elements of the problem. The sequel --</p><p>MCGUIRK: Maybe.</p><p>MCCORD: Yes.</p><p>IMUS: He's updating from Beirut to whatever it is. Maybe he can update his stupid environment book, Hot, Flat, and Corrupt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>IMUS: Keep it right here on the Fox Business Networkthroughout the day for the latest news and financial developments.</p><p>Then tonight at 6:00 Eastern Time, join Neil Cavuto and his guest, former New York City mayor Ed Koch.

She's the author of \"Paula Deen: It Ain't All About the Cooking,\" \"Christmas With Paula Deen,\" a whole bunch of other books, all have been best-sellers.</p><p>She's been on everything. She's the founder of the Lady and Sons restaurant, co-owner of Uncle Bubba's Oyster House.</p><p>She lives with her family in Savannah, Georgia. Her new book from Simon &amp; Schuster is a coffee table book, beautiful, entitled \"Paula Deen: Savannah Style,\" Paula Deen and Brandon Branch.</p><p>Please welcome to the program, Paula Deen.</p><p>Good morning, Ms. Deen.</p><p>PAULA DEEN, HOST, \"PAULA'S HOME COOKING\": Good morning, Imus. How are you?</p><p>IMUS: I'm fine, baby. How are you?</p><p>DEEN: What an intro. And may I say, I have loved listening to you and watching you through the years.</p><p>IMUS: Thank you very much. I appreciate that.</p><p>DEEN: Oh, I have loved it. And thank you so much for having me on.</p><p>IMUS: So, you got rid of the husband.</p><p>DEEN: Got rid of the husband, yes.</p><p>IMUS: What did he do?</p><p>DEEN: I was married for 27 years, and I married -- I met and married my neighbor when I moved out on to Wilmington Island. And we've been together six years, and it's like we're just soul mates and --</p><p>IMUS: Well, that's good.</p><p>DEEN: It's just been a wonderful, wonderful life. My husband liked cold beer more than his desire for his family, I guess you might say.</p><p>And he adored us. He adored us, but he could never put down the alcohol. And, you know, I tried for 27 years to fix it and I couldn't, so I had to accept the fact that I could not change that.</p><p>IMUS: It ruins everything.</p><p>You know -- we're talking with Paula Deen. Her new book called \"Paula Deen: Savannah Style.\" It's a coffee table book. It is full of gorgeous photographs of how Paula and -- what's this guy's name, old Brandon?</p><p>DEEN: Brandon Branch.</p><p>IMUS: Old Brandon, who decorates these rooms. And man, you have to take your shoes off to walk into one of these rooms.</p><p>DEEN: Well, they're beautiful rooms. People -- Brandon and I, we tried to create a book that we could take people into these beautiful places, Imus, that when you come to Savannah you wouldn't ordinarily see.</p><p>You know, Savannah is made up of all kinds of magical, hidden gardens. And they're all behind walls, so you can't see them. So, this is our way of exposing people to these treasures.</p><p>IMUS: I like these songs you picked -- \"At Last,\" Etta James.</p><p>DEEN: That was the song that my husband and I danced to, the first dance after our wedding.</p><p>IMUS: Your new husband?</p><p>DEEN: My new husband, yes.</p><p>IMUS: Oh, OK. Don't be picking songs --</p><p>DEEN: My for life husband.</p><p>IMUS: Don't be picking songs from the last one. We just got --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>DEEN: You know, I ain't a quitter, Imus.

This is FIRST MOVE, and here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Testing times. Talk of a U.S. economic wake up gathering steam, but can the science keep up?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mexican mutiny. Big oil producers agree to supply cuts, but one nation says no.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a healthier headspace, the CEO aiming to help healthcare heroes cope with the stress.</p><p>It's Friday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE wherever you're joining us from. It's also Easter Friday, so many global markets are closed. It's been a challenging week for many people after another week spent in sad and strange circumstances.</p><p>We're here with you and we have a jam-packed show with the latest news, but hopefully some advice as you heard there for dealing with some of the anxiety you may be feeling at this moment. More on that coming up later on in the show.</p><p>But for now we'll get straight to the drivers, JPMorgan sounding the alarm with its latest outlook for the U.S. economy. Economists say the unemployment rate could hit 20 percent in April with a loss of 25 million jobs.</p><p>Economic growth could shrink by 40 percent in the second quarter. The economic data this week, truly underscoring, I think the need for a plan to reopen the U.S. economy.</p><p>Christine Romans joins me now. Christine, you and I have been talking about this it seems like for weeks, the cost of the economic and the jobs crisis, wherever you are in the world has to be weighed in some sense over what we're trying to achieve with the health crisis.</p><p>You can't choose between these things, but we do need a plan so the conversation needs to be had.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely. So the social sacrifice of these 17 million people who lost their jobs and then the short term plan to get rescue funds to them, we know these extended unemployment benefits are going to start to flow in the next few days, maybe starting in California and in New York and some of the big states so that extra money is coming for small business still need to connect them with the promise of all of that cash, but that's the near term picture.</p><p>And then the longer-term picture is when do we go back to what will be a new normal and you know, interestingly, the Fed Chief yesterday said, you know, we will go back. We will have the economy recover once the virus is contained but be careful how quickly we move.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEROME POWELL, FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: We need to have a plan nationally for reopening the economy, but we all want it to happen as quickly as possible.</p><p>We all want to avoid a false start, where we will partially reopen and that results in a spike in coronavirus cases and then we have to go back again to go to square one.</p><p>We all want to avoid that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Patience and balance and avoiding a false start because, do we think that would do lasting damage to consumer spending and consumer psyche, Julia, if people don't feel comfortable going back to work or going back to some sort of a routine, we know from our polling this week, 60 percent of Americans said at the end of April, April 30th, they do not feel comfortable going back to their pre-crisis routines.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, as desperate as we are to return to some normality, I think at this stage, that point for me is critical. The majority of people still think we can quickly try and reopen the economy and get back to normality.</p><p>But at this moment, the majority of people are afraid that we don't have perhaps the testing, we're not sure who's had this, who's got this and the protections need to be put in place. They know that.</p><p>ROMANS: Okay, so the testing -- right, testing, whether you have the virus, antibody testing. Some sort of monitoring so that we can do contact tracing and find out if there are outbreaks or hotspots that come back in the fall, we know how to contain that, and how to also contain the economic damage from that in that neighborhood.</p><p>We also need to talk about policies in place in the future so that frontline workers are better protected, right? So that people are paid to stay home when they are sick. So there are other kind of societal and structural mechanisms so we don't find ourselves with so much economic damage to the people who are the essential workers in the first place.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and it's so tough to gauge as we began this segment with some of the expectations here. Terrifying in terms of numbers, but I think you and I have been sort of predicting this now for a while, but it's -- it is so tough to gauge what the short term and the longer term impact is.</p><p>Technology on the testing side is key for me, but also technology. This -- the United States is known for its innovation for its Big Tech companies, and the fact that we're now starting to see those names cropping up with one, getting money to people in the short term to protect the economy, but two, of course, just looking at the operations around the country and going, how can we be so advanced on the one hand, and yet, on the frontlines where it matters, at times, we're in the dark ages.</p><p>[09:05:14]</p><p>ROMANS: It's so interesting on two fronts. When you talk about ventilators, for example, and the frustration of not being able to get ventilators or get the proper masks for -- and PPE for the frontline workers.</p><p>Now, on the other hand, you've got those moneys sitting there to give to the unemployed or to give to small business and you can't connect the people who need it with the funds that have been promised. That's also -- you're right -- a technology problem.</p><p>It's just in the biggest economy on Earth will we learn from this to make sure it doesn't happen again.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Digitization, the use of technology better. Christine Romans, thank you so much for joining us, as always.</p><p>Now, New York has more coronavirus cases than any country in the world. Around 162,000 people have contracted the virus in the state, more than 7,000 people have lost their lives.</p><p>Athena Jones has been looking at what we're seeing here. Athena, great to have you with us.</p><p>It's tough to comprehend the scale of what we're seeing, and we've been talking about it, I think on a daily basis. For the medical workers on the frontlines, it's been impossible to keep up with what they're facing.</p><p>ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Julia. That's right. You know, the impact of this virus on a state like New York is, as you mentioned, this is the state with the most cases in the country, and in fact, more cases than any country in the world.</p><p>So a lot of impact here, including on the healthcare workers. There have been some positive signs in recent days when it comes to that, those concerns we had over the last few weeks about overwhelming the hospital system.</p><p>Governor Cuomo saying in his most recent update that it appears as though at the rate things are going, it may be possible to see that the hospital system is stabilized.</p><p>But there's no doubt about it, as we enter this holiday weekend, we're seeing bad news -- more bad news -- some of it wrapped in slightly better news. So the State of New York reporting its highest single day death toll for the third day in a row. At the same time, hospitalizations are way down. They went down to 200 from 585 the day before.</p><p>Intensive Care Unit admissions are also a way down, and so these are positive signs. These are the kinds of signs they want to see and this is why Governor Cuomo says social distancing is working here. We need to keep doing it.</p><p>As you mentioned, though, there are still concerns about supplies in various places. While we talk to some hospital workers in one place, they'll say we have enough masks, others will say, well, we're having to use our masks for four or five shifts, we need to be able to have a resupply. And so those are still some lingering issues.</p><p>And also, the fact is, the Governor had to sign last night, an Executive Order allowing licensed funeral directors from all around the country to come to New York and operate here in New York to take off some of the pressure on the system because so many people have died and some of them have died so quickly. More than 7,000 New Yorkers have fallen victim to this virus --Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's unimaginable. Athena, we were just showing some pictures. I think of Hart Island. Can you tell me what's going on there, please?</p><p>JONES: Right. Hart Island is an island in Long Island Sound, it is north of here. It's off the coast of the Bronx. It is an island that has been used for over a hundred years, a 150 years or so as a place to bury unclaimed bodies, and it's run by the Department of Corrections.</p><p>Well, this time because of this crisis, they are now going to be burying unclaimed bodies there in two weeks' time. If they haven't been claimed in 14 days. They will be put on Hart Island. They will be identified in such a way that they can be disinterred to be buried again, proper burial that the family may want to give it.</p><p>But the change here really is a change to the rules in the New York Medical Examiner's Office. Before, unclaimed bodies still went to Hart Island, but after 30 days or even 60 days.</p><p>Now, because of the influx of bodies and deaths that number has come down to 14 days.</p><p>So it's just another sign of how -- of what a toll the virus is taking -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's -- I'm lost for words. Athena Jones, thank you so much for joining us there and I can tell it's incredibly cold out there because your eyes are watering.</p><p>So, quick hot drink for you, too. Stay warm, please. And stay safe.</p><p>All right, the European Union has agreed and emergency relief deal worth half a trillion euros. Weeks of fighting over money, medical supplies and border restrictions have strained European solidarity. The most contentious issue of all -- debt sharing.</p><p>Well, that's been left for another day. Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Berlin.</p><p>Fred, let's talk about what they did manage to agree on first and then we can talk about where the big struggle was.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Julia, yes, I mean, they were very proud of the fact they did reach out agreement. You are absolutely right with the contentious issue, it is certainly the one that they left out which is those coronabonds or eurobonds as they're also called.</p><p>[09:10:10]</p><p>PLEITGEN: Now what they did agree on is really a three-tier system to support countries that are in trouble financially because of the coronavirus crisis, companies that are in trouble because of the coronavirus crisis, but then also employees as well.</p><p>On the one hand, you have the European Stability Mechanism that of course, we know from the 2008 Financial Crisis to support nations that get into problems. There was a lot of back and forth, especially between the Netherlands and Italy on that issue, what the terms would be. In the end, they did manage to reach an agreement on that.</p><p>The European Investment Bank is going to be the organization that's going to help small and medium-sized businesses in a lot of these countries to get over the hump, to really stay in business as long as they are being shut down right now.</p><p>So that's going to be that mechanism that they're going to use and then there's that program, SURE, which is the jobs program and that, Julia, is pretty much an exact copy of the German playbook of 2008.</p><p>The Germans call it the Short Labor Program, the Kurzarbeit Program, as they call it here in Germany, where essentially what companies do is they make their employees work maybe half the time, maybe even less, pay them less, and then governments pick up the tab or pick up the difference.</p><p>Of course, the Europeans realize that a government, a lot of governments can't do that. So now they have this E.U. fund or this E.U. mechanism called SURE to try and get that into place. That really is something that the Germans say helped protect a lot of jobs in their country in 2008, and something that they want to see on a European level.</p><p>You could hear Angela Merkel yesterday talking about what a great program she thinks that is. So it seems as though on a lot of the issues, they did manage to reach an agreement, but you are absolutely right. The big question is going to be the financing of all this and are eurobonds in the end going to be issued.</p><p>And there, of course, the differences between some of the Southern European countries specifically Italy and Spain and a lot of the Northern European countries like the powerhouses of Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and also Finland as well, that still remains in place, and Angela Merkel yesterday, I listened to her press statement that she gave -- her Easter press statement, she once again, flat out says, she rejects eurobond as a mechanism to try and finance all this -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a challenge, isn't it? I guess they get -- or risk being accused of some kind of moral hazard having not agreed to this during the financial crisis than agreeing to it when all nations are impacted by something so devastating, to the same degree as this health crisis, but the question is, do they come around to it in the future because for Spain and Italy, it's some -- it's been more devastating than ever.</p><p>Fred, thank you so much for that update there. Fred Pleitgen.</p><p>All right now to an update on the British Prime Minister's health. Boris Johnson is just beginning his recovery says his spokesman. The official said the Prime Minister is following doctor's orders and will not be going to Chequers, his countryside retreat.</p><p>Prime Minister Johnson left intensive care last night, but does remain in hospital. He tested positive for the coronavirus two weeks ago. We wish him well.</p><p>All markets meanwhile closed for Good Friday, a day after Saudi Arabia and Russia reached a tentative deal to reduce production by some 10 million barrels a day in May and June.</p><p>But at the OPEC Plus meeting, Mexico declined to support the agreement. Talks will continue at today's G-20 meeting of Energy Ministers, and at the same time, Richard caught up with the CEO of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and discuss the issue and the need for a longer term fix.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIRILL DMITRIEV, CEO, RUSSIA DIRECT INVESTMENT FUND: It's very important that the agreement that has been hammered out today is really a longer term agreement. It lasts for around two years, maybe more, and I think there is a clear alignment to understand that, you know, we need to be together while economy is going through recovery from coronavirus effect.</p><p>So this is specifically why the agreement this longer than one year, and this is why many countries are committing to it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: John Defterios joins us now live from Abu Dhabi. That's an interesting point about the setup of this deal. What I see in the composition of what we've got here is something very, very front loaded.</p><p>But talk us through the logic of that and whether Mexico can be brought on board here.</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Okay, let's cover the machinations of that agreement and the structure Julia, ten, eight and six -- 10 million barrels a day for two months, eight million barrels a day for six months, and then the remainder until April 2022 at six million barrels.</p><p>But you do the math here it is pretty simple. The magic number is two billion barrels. So you have two months at 10 million barrels and then the next six months will eat up two billion barrels of the glut and that is the target for 2020 if you didn't act. So this is solid.</p><p>When it comes to Mexico, I have to think that done Trump is going to intervene here. In fact, the President of Mexico was suggesting, Julia, that the U.S. is even willing to pick up 250,000 to 300,000 barrels that Mexico did not want to cut.</p><p>Their target was 400,000. They walked away at the table just offering 100,000 barrels a day, and there's a reason behind this as well.</p><p>[09:15:19]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Pemex, the state operator in Mexico, it lost $18 billion in 2019. It has a debt of and $105 billion, and the President Lopez Obrador said when he came to power, he would boost the production by 50 percent. They're nowhere near close to that. And that's why he's not eager to cut.</p><p>Now, whether Donald Trump would offer the cuts and what formula for the United States is another matter entirely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I was about to say what role is the United States playing in this ultimately? I mean, what we're talking about is stripping back around 10 percent of all supply that we have at this moment, but John, you've talked to as many times over the last few weeks about how a demand for oil has dropped by -- what a third -- as a result of the demand destruction that we're seeing around the world. So where does that leave us?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes, we're at least 30 million barrels a day right now. Many think that the second quarter is going to be 20 million barrels a day. But I have to say, Julia, the G-20 has been going on now, the Energy Ministers meeting for about an hour. That is the right venue.</p><p>Mexico is a member, so there's going to be pressure put on there. In fact, Vladimir Putin said I'm ready to pick it up where we left off yesterday. The nine-hour marathon, four hours courtesy of the Mexican Minister. She is now very popular around the table right now.</p><p>And also, we'll get clarity. U.S., Canada and Brazil -- the reason I bring it up is how do you define the U.S. contribution here? The Energy Secretary late yesterday before the OPEC meeting broke up said you can't mandate U.S. companies to cut, but the IEA Executive Director who helped call the meeting can certainly come up with some figures they can use for the second half of 2020.</p><p>So that's how you get there. Ten million from OPEC Plus, if they can get Mexico signed on, and you have to manage expectations, Julia, at five million barrels -- it is what is expected of the G-20 today.</p><p>If you don't manage it, we're at $22.00 on WTI. We had that 18-year low of $20.00 on March 30th. It's going to be a bloodbath on Monday if you don't manage it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Then, we shall wait and see what they can come up with today. John Defterios, thank you. Keeping on top of that for us.</p><p>We're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, the wait for COVID-19 antibody tests. Could that be the key that unlocks the path back to work?</p><p>And later, getting into the right headspace. How medical staff and the rest of us could perhaps benefit from some clearer thinking and some mindfulness. That's after this. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:20:47]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Testing, testing, testing -- I'll never forget those words -- the words of the World Health Organization seven weeks ago as the realization about the scale of the coronavirus outbreak dawned on the world.</p><p>We now realize the importance of testing not only to identify those that have the virus and protect others, but also that it may be a vital tool in restarting economies around the world.</p><p>We're already seeing it. And we've discussed on the show a key component of that is antibody testing, singling out those who've already been exposed, perhaps even without showing symptoms.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House Coronavirus Task Force said on CNN's \"New Day\" today that those tests are on the way.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: Yes, actually at the last Taskforce meeting, the individuals responsible for both developing, validating and getting the test out are saying -- and I'm certain that that's going to happen that within a period of a week or so, we're going to have a rather large number of tests that are available.</p><p>One of the things that you mentioned that's important because other countries have gotten burned by this, these antibody tests are tests that we do on other diseases, but they need to be validated. You need to make sure that they're consistent and that they're accurate.</p><p>And that's what we're doing now, both with the N.I.H. and with the F.D.A. is validating them. As soon as they get validated, they'll be out there for people to use.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: And so Dr. Fauci, does that mean -- what does that mean for us? Does that mean that we are shifting away from an emphasis in testing for coronavirus to antibody testing to see who has had it and recovered?</p><p>FAUCI: No, not at all. I mean, those things are done in parallel. One does not essentially rule out the other. We still rely appropriately and heavily on the test to show that someone is in fact infected.</p><p>Whereas the antibody test says that you were infected, and if you're feeling well, you very likely recovered.</p><p>When you're trying to find out whether a person is infected, that's the test we always talk about, but as we look forward, as we get to the point of at least considering opening up the country as it were, it's very important to appreciate and to understand how much that virus has penetrated the society.</p><p>Because it's very likely that there are a large number of people out there that have been infected, have been asymptomatic and did not know they were infected. If their antibody test is positive, one can formulate kind of strategies about whether or not they would be at risk or vulnerable.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Dr. Sanjay Gupta joins us now. Sanjay, always great to have you on the show. Our regular viewers will have known that we've been discussing this for a couple of weeks now. The testing for antibodies, the ordinary tests for those that are sick with the illness or the virus right now.</p><p>We've also had companies saying, we're producing tests. We're getting them out there. Where are we on a nation scale, coming up with these tests and getting a more mass program in progress?</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT You know, it's interesting. We've heard the story about the actual test for the virus for some time, Julia, and everyone knows, I think at this point that we certainly had inadequate testing early on. They're ramping up those virus testing now.</p><p>The antibody testing, which is a different test. That's looking for the antibodies in your blood after you've been exposed to the virus. It was interesting. They sort of loosened up the regulations, Julia, the F.D.A. did initially because they knew that these were important tests. They wanted to get them out there.</p><p>And I think what followed were, frankly, some bad tests. Tests that were not validated, did not seem to be very accurate. So now I think that they've gone back and tightened up the regulations. They're going to validate all of these tests ahead of time, and as you just heard from Dr. Fauci, he thinks these antibody tests should be available in much larger numbers, he said within the next week.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see because, I certainly trust Dr. Fauci, but we've heard that line before with other testing, but it could be very valuable, I think the antibody testing.</p><p>If it were widely and easily available, Julia, I would have that test done as well.</p><p>[09:25:08]</p><p>GUPTA: Was I exposed to coronavirus? I don't know. I never really had any symptoms. But I think the point is that maybe a lot of people out there who never had any symptoms or had minimal symptoms, but in fact, we're infected with the coronavirus, this test will help them figure that out.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You actually answered my next question there in that we've heard this before, and perhaps, we've been a little bit disappointed on the time horizon here.</p><p>GUPTA: Yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: But we've also discussed on the show the idea that we're not even sure how much immunity you build in your system, how long it lasts, whether it's enough? Other tests that we're talking about producing at some point soon, going to be able to work out how much immunity you have and also what's enough perhaps to get you back in the workforce and not still have you at risk.</p><p>GUPTA: Right. That is the critical question, Julia, and I think, you know, the good test will tell you if you have the antibodies, which is an important data point.</p><p>But I think your question ultimately is, so what does that mean? Does that mean you in fact are protected? And how long are you protected? We don't know the answer to that.</p><p>We think that people are going to be protected at least for a period of time. One thing that people have looked at is the SARS virus because that was also a coronavirus and had some similarities, and what they found was that people did develop immunity, but it didn't last years and years.</p><p>For example, they tested people after five years and found they really didn't have immunity at that point, but even if you had immunity for a year, long enough until the vaccine came around hopefully, that would be very, very helpful.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, a bridge to a vaccine. That's what we're trying to build here in whatever form.</p><p>GUPTA: Right. Exactly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, great to have you with us as always. CNN's chief medical correspondent.</p><p>GUPTA: Have a great weekend, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You, too. You, too. Okay, we're going to break. Up next, Europe and the United States talk of exit strategies from emergency measures. But in the world's poorest countries, the crisis is only just beginning. What more is required? We'll discuss.</p><p>[09:30:18]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. More than 1.6 million cases of coronavirus have been recorded now globally. The death toll has surpassed 96,000 people.</p><p>The I.M.F. warns the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, but there are also signs of hope.</p><p>The City of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first reported reopened this week. The United States top doctors even saying that Americans may be able to take summer vacations.</p><p>But while richer nations work on strategies to move on from the initial impact, it's the world's poorest countries that will be hardest hit. Philanthropist Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation spoke to CNN's Poppy Harlow and warned that we have yet to fully grasp the scale of the crisis in Africa.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MELINDA GATES, PHILANTHROPIST, GATES FOUNDATION: When I saw what China had to do to isolate such an enormous part of their population, my first thought was Africa. How in the world are they going to deal with this?</p><p>I've been in townships all over Africa, in slums. When we talk about in our country, physical distancing, and then hand washing. If you live in a slum, you can't physical distance. You have to go out and get your meal. You don't have clean water to wash your hands.</p><p>And so as soon as I saw that, and we know from the foundation's work, how quickly disease spreads, I thought, oh my gosh, we have a crisis on our hands that we aren't even talking about yet in the United States and what's going to happen to the rest of the world.</p><p>POPPY HARLOW, CNN ANCHOR: That's how much worse it's going to be in the developing world?</p><p>GATES: It's going to be horrible in the developing world, and part of the reason you're seeing the case numbers still don't look very bad is because they don't have access to very many tests.</p><p>So, you know, look at Ecuador. Look at what's going on in Ecuador. They're putting bodies out on the street. You're going to see that and countries in Africa.</p><p>HARLOW: You think this pandemic is just actually going to set us back in terms of gender disparity? That it will disproportionately fall on women. What do you mean?</p><p>GATES: Here's what I know, is that 70 percent of the healthcare workers around the world are women. Women do more than two times the unpaid labor in their homes. So they're caring for people in the health system, and they're caring for people at home.</p><p>And at the same time, we have this disparity that we're not collecting what we call disaggregated data. What that means is we're not differently -- differentiating data that comes in about men and women.</p><p>HARLOW: I wonder what keeps you up at night right now?</p><p>GATES: What keeps me up at night are the vulnerable populations. You know, what keeps me up at night is in the U.S., the kids who are falling behind because they don't have access to broadband or to a computer, so they're not getting to continue their learning.</p><p>What keeps me up at night are the vulnerable populations who I know in Africa, I have met some of them. I can't imagine being a parent in those circumstances and those are the things that keep me up at night.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Definitely, time to act. David McKenzie and Eleni Giokos join us now from South Africa. Guys, great to have you on the show. Some really poignant comments and fears, I think, being addressed there.</p><p>David, I want to begin with you because we've seen the struggle that nations in Europe have had, the United States have had, some of the richest nations in the world, let's be clear.</p><p>How does the healthcare system where you are compared to Europe, to the United States and the struggle we've had, because there's no comparison.</p><p>DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, when I'm here in South Africa, in fact, it's a more complicated picture. There is, Julia, a kind of mix of systems, a pretty robust public health system and private system as well.</p><p>But on the African continent as a whole, you know, you ask what's it like compared to Europe, around 4,000 hospital beds per million people in Europe. In 43 countries in Africa, there are around five hospital beds per million people.</p><p>And that shows you why the leaders on the African continent have largely acted decisively to shut down the economies, closed borders and to try and stem the spread of COVID-19 before it gets out of control.</p><p>You know, as that interview suggested, at this point, there are fewer confirmed cases on the continent than in other regions, but those cases could spread rapidly.</p><p>[09:35:10]</p><p>MCKENZIE: And if it gets to that point, it could quite easily collapse the health system. Just in the last few days, we've been reporting out a story on medical tourism, Julia, and the issue there is both the middle classes and the powerful wealthy elite in this continent frequently travel overseas for medical treatment. It's about a billion dollar a year industry there.</p><p>And what I've found out in speaking to, you know, people who usually use that including a historian in Nigeria who has cancer -- is recovering from cancer, he said, this might be a wakeup call for African leaders in the many countries where just citizens of this continent feel that the health infrastructure has been ignored over the years.</p><p>They said they're stuck in their countries. The leaders are stuck in their countries. Maybe it's time that they did more to fix those health infrastructures after this pandemic went -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and a call to action for other leaders, I think around the world that this continent needs focus, too, and support at this moment.</p><p>Eleni, come in here because fast action to lock down and shut down your economies help to try and suppress the number of cases. But the economic consequences of that, as we're seeing everywhere are devastating.</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely devastating. I mean, here in South Africa, just last night, President Cyril Ramaphosa extended the lockdown to a total of five weeks. That means that the economy is going to be shut down until the end of April.</p><p>Just to give you a sense of what it's like, only essential goods are sold in stores, which means that anything that is manufactured in the country that is nonessential, even mining companies have been shut down. So you can only imagine the economic devastation that is going to occur.</p><p>This is why the President said that companies should try and not resort to force majeure. They should still pay suppliers even if they're not getting goods, and they should still pay employees.</p><p>But the World Bank came up with staggering numbers, Julia, and we're talking about decimation of sub Saharan African growth where it's going to contract by over five percent in 2020.</p><p>That is a scary number because if you need to get jobs and economic growth going, the lowest number you can have on economic growth in Africa is around three percent to really make a dent in terms of sustainable development goals and spending money on infrastructure.</p><p>The other big problem that the World Bank and even the U.N. and I.M.F. have mentioned is that Africa right now is going to need debt forgiveness and debt relief, because the continent as a whole spent over $40 billion in debt servicing costs just last year.</p><p>If we can free up that money, you pump liquidity straight into the markets, which means you can throw money at this problem. Remember the European Union, the likes of China, and even in the U.S. are embarking on quantitative easing and stimulus packages.</p><p>African continent doesn't have the fiscal room to do this. So we need liquidity. We need to get money into the system. And of course, with the help of the I.M.F. and other institutions, you're seeing everyone coming to the party, even the African Development Bank is going to pump $10 billion into our oil producing countries as an example, that are going to be completely hurt by the drop in the oil price and of course, a drop in demand.</p><p>So the domino effect, Julia is incredible. And the point is that everyone has to now stand together to find a solution to the African problem that is going to relate to COVID-19, and just the impact it's going to have on the ground.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I couldn't agree more and your point about debt forgiveness and freeing up money that isn't there at this moment, such a critical one.</p><p>Guys, thank you for helping us with this week's Call to Action. Such a huge problem and a focus and a solution required here.</p><p>Eleni Giokos, David McKenzie, thank you so much.</p><p>All right. Coming up on FIRST MOVE, stay-at-home orders continue in many parts of the world. How one company is offering remote communication solutions with a Cloud phone system and more, the details next.</p><p>[09:42:10]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. As millions of people around the world are forced to find new ways of living, of communicating and working from home, telecommunications company Avaya moved quickly to enable large companies, hospitals, even governments and more to swiftly adapt to this new normal.</p><p>Avaya currently sees it powers around 90 percent of the Fortune 100 companies alone.</p><p>Jim Chirico is CEO of Avaya. He joins us now. Jim, fantastic to have you on the show. As I mentioned there, we are all trying to adapt to the new normal in various different ways. Just start by explaining exactly what you do and how you differ from perhaps some of the other communication companies that names keep popping up all the time. Zoom, for example, was on the show yesterday. What makes you different?</p><p>JIM CHIRICO, CEO, AVAYA: Yes, sure, Julia. First of all, thank you for having me on the show and clearly our hearts go out to everyone battling this pandemic around the globe.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Of course.</p><p>CHIRICO: Avaya is the largest collaboration and communication company provider in the world. We're different because we have more than 100,000 customers. We operate in over 180 countries, and as you pointed out 90 percent of Fortune 100 run on Avaya.</p><p>We have been deploying our work from home solutions as a leader in the enterprise in the Cloud space, now since the early part of January, and in fact, we've deployed more than two million licenses for free to allow our customers to have the business continuity they need to run their business.</p><p>But really, that's only half the story. That's the business side. There's obviously a human side to this as well. And you know, Avaya has technology that others do not that can help ease the stress and anxiety on all of us.</p><p>And let me just give you a couple of examples. Humana, 13 million members, a global company in the health insurance space realized that they needed to get solutions in order to help alleviate a lot of their concerns from their customers, many of whom are seniors, therefore in a higher risk category, and in fact, rely on the telephone for a lot of their communications.</p><p>We immediately deployed 21,000 licenses. So they can handle the massive increase in call volumes. They also could have health and safety for their employees to work from home and be productive.</p><p>And similar experience with Deutsche Telekom with 7,000 customers, in just four days, we enabled their workforce to work from home, really helping answer questions and alleviating a lot of stress on their customers.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Talk to me about the healthcare sector as well because I know you have more than -- what -- 5, 800 healthcare institutions around the world and you specifically were helping some of the healthcare workers in Wuhan, the epicenter of this original outbreak just to communicate, to try and relieve some of the need for PPE. Talk to me about your experiences with that.</p><p>CHIRICO: Yes, sure. We started -- we have a video application, a collaboration platform that we call Spaces, and what's unique and different about that with many of the video providers, it does provide the capability to do video.</p><p>But after that session ends, we have a room where the folks can continue to collaborate. And that's what we've been deploying across thousands of hospitals, and we started as you said back in January with Wuhan, where we deployed our video Spaces technology, really to enable not only the doctors to consult with other doctors in the hot zone and outside by doing it virtually, but also we've been connecting patients with their families, because obviously the patients are left alone in their hospital bed.</p><p>So our solution eases a tremendous amount of strain on the hospital. Clearly, with the supplies being in short supply, being able to consult with your patients and providing that extra comforting care really alleviates a lot of the pressure on getting and changing your gowns each time you visit -- you visit new customers and our video solutions, in fact they've been up -- roughly about 1,800 percent since January and we're just glad that we can help connect people in the time of crisis.</p><p>[09:45:05]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, physical distancing needs some unique solutions at this moment. And the time, I guess, is what's key here, as well, just allowing that room to be open the whole time to allow the interactions.</p><p>Jim, I think one of the big questions for all of us at this moment is, what does the new normal look like? We're just a fraction of people, even just here in the United States that are coming into this actually worked from home. What is the new normal -- will more people -- far more people work from home in the future, do you think?</p><p>CHIRICO: Yes, now, that's a great question. I will tell you, COVID-19 has really accelerated if you will, reinventing sort of the new workforce. I've been at home now for almost a month. I'm a go to the office guy, it should take me a little, while but I'm adapting quite well. And I think that will be the new norm.</p><p>In the U.S. as an example, there's 60 million knowledge workers, and prior to this pandemic, only about two to three percent worked from home. Study suggests 25 to 30 percent in just the next two years.</p><p>So it's accelerated that move, and really, if you look at the long term trend, you're going to really see that collaboration and remote worker capabilities are going to be essential for the enterprise.</p><p>One would not have thought of that even six weeks ago. The good news from an Avaya perspective is we're here to help, and we have technologies that can enable productive work from home -- work from home agents.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's going to be interesting to see what happens. Hopefully it makes us all better workers, perhaps and a better work-life balance, but we've got a way to go until we get there.</p><p>Jim, great to have you with us. Jim Chirico there. Stay safe, sir and thank you for the work you're doing, too.</p><p>CHIRICO: You, too.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, coming up after the break.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: That was last night in London, and it was police saluting the N.H.S. health workers. Our doctors and nurses will have the right psychological wins from the virus, them and many others.</p><p>The CEO of Headspace joins us next and gives us advice on ways to handle that.</p><p>[09:50:19]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The psychological damage to healthcare workers dealing with coronavirus patients has come to light in a survey of healthcare workers from China.</p><p>More than half had symptoms of depression, nearly 45 percent had some level of anxiety, and over a third showed signs of insomnia, more than seven in 10 felt distressed.</p><p>Headspace is offering its online meditation services free to healthcare workers in the U.K., France and the United States. It also struck a deal with Governor Andrew Cuomo to help New Yorkers, too.</p><p>Rich Pierson is CEO and cofounder of headspace. Rich, great to have you with us. I think given the images that we've seen from the around the world, there's any surprise, the anxiety and the pressure that our heroes on the frontline have faced. Talk about the decision to give them access to what you have here to try and help.</p><p>RICH PIERSON, CEO AND COFOUNDER, HEADSPACE: Yes, thanks. Well, thanks for having me, I think, you know, we realized pretty quickly that the folks that were going to be on the frontlines are going to be experiencing extreme kind of mental distress and knowing that they're going to have to go into the hospitals and healthcare systems every single day, we really thought about this as a kind of marathon, not a sprint and I think you're seeing that play out now.</p><p>So we really wanted to provide a service where, you know, in between the great work that they're doing that they can -- they can look off their most precious resource which is their mind.</p><p>So we first made it available in in the U.S. and then we quickly followed up with the N.H.S. in the U.K. and made it available to 1.2 million of their whole staff in the N.H.S. and yesterday, as you mentioned, we launched in France with the Healthcare Ministry to make it accessible there.</p><p>So you know, there is content to help with stress, with anxiety, content to help you sleep at night, specific perhaps on sadness, so really looking at all of the emotional ups and downs that, you know, our heroes are going to be facing, we really feel that Headspace can help in that journey.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How much response have you seen? Have you seen people signing up and actually using this product and telling you that it's helping?</p><p>PIERSON: Yes, we we've had so many stories from frontline, you know, you just have to kind of go on social channels and see the response that we've had from folks that are actually in in the hospitals doing this great work.</p><p>We've had stories of people saying that they don't know how they would survive without it. I think people are just looking for some kind of pause in their day just to take a breath. And I think, you know, a service and a tool like Headspace can really help people in their struggle as they do this work.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What about education, too, because children -- children come to mind and for many of them, they perhaps understand why they can't see their friends, they can't go to school, but how do you explain to children what's going on and try and help them understand? Do you have help on that front, too?</p><p>PIERSON: Yes, I think -- well, two things have come out of this, you know, this pandemic is that I think we appreciate our healthcare workers more than we ever did. And I think anyone that's got kids at home, I've got a kid at home, they really start to appreciate teachers, and how hard a job that is.</p><p>And so we've actually made it available for all educators. That's actually our social impact, kind of directive that we have ongoing all the time. But we've actually created some specific content for parents and for teachers to be able to explain the situation to their children in a way that kind of makes sense through the lens of mindfulness, and then we create specific content.</p><p>We have a kid section in the in the app where parents and teachers can use it with their classrooms or with their children at home.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Rich, you have 62 million users in, I believe, 180 different countries. We're all at different stages of this outbreak. The pressures are different here. Do you think just based on what you're seeing and the use that actually we'll all learn to be more mindful about our friends, about our environment, about the people around us as a result of the experiences that we've had?</p><p>PIERSON: Yes, I think what we're seeing is that people are really opening up and accepting the fact that our mental health is as important as our physical health.</p><p>You know, we spend a lot of time looking after our physical health, but very few of us actually spend the time to look after the health of our mind, which we believe is the most -- our most precious resource.</p><p>And I think a situation like this really brings a lot of these kind of struggles that people have with their mental health to the surface, and I just -- you know, one thing that I do think that is definitely going to come out of this is that people are going to start to prioritize the health of their mind more and more.</p><p>[09:55:14]</p><p>PIERSON: And I think we're seeing that with the increased usage that we have on the product. I think we're seeing that with, you know, our partners like Starbucks that have made Headspace available for, you know, all of their employees.</p><p>So I think you're going to see employers taking a stronger look at the health of their workforce through their mind. I think you're going to see this in healthcare systems as we're already kind of seeing, and I think you're going to see it integrated in schools because I think it's just going to elevate it.</p><p>And when you see the Governor's Office in New York, reaching out to us to make it available to all New Yorkers, I think that that shows you how worried people in very important positions are thinking about the state of our mental health in a pandemic like this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, in a pandemic, but at all times, it has to be a conversation that can be had.</p><p>Rich, thank you for joining us on the show and keep in touch, please, and stay safe.</p><p>PIERSON: Yes. Thank you for having me. Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Thank you. The CEO of Headspace there, Rich Pierson, and I have tweeted out more of what Headspace offers for healthcare workers and New Yorkers. That's @juliachatterleyCNN, so if you want to get that information you can. It's on my Twitter handle.</p><p>Thank you for watching. Thank you for being with us all week. We leave you today with the sights and sounds of Good Friday observances at Paris's Notre Dame Cathedral Only a handful of people were allowed in and you can watch the video and see.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020041001cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMT-XC91-JB20-G1VK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7782\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

If we'd known in 2010 what we know with 2020 dawning, the world would be a very different place. The Bitcoin run-up, for example, would not have taken until 2017, and GPU chip maker stocks would have exploded back in about 2011 or so. Yet the nature of time forbids such flights of fancy, and recently, JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM) co-president <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/27/jp-morgan-co-president-talks-his-2020-outlook-big-tech-threat-and-esg.html\">Daniel Pinto </url> offered up a look at the market to come in 2020. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Future Is Tech. Sustainable Tech. And Finance.</emphasis></p><p>When someone like Daniel Pinto says that they can't go to a client meeting without running into a particular issue, you know it has to figure in heavily to any analysis of the near-term future. And that's exactly what Pinto had to say about the notion of environmental, social and governance (ESG) projects. We took a look at the notion of  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/Impact-investing-and-what-it-can-do-for-your-portfolio/\">impact investing </url>  back in November, and as Pinto relates it, ESG and impact investing are likely to be big parts of 2020's market trends. Pinto looks for this trend to move higher  exponentially higher , he termed it over the next decade. </p><p>That was just the start of Pinto's projections forward. Pinto took a look at the oncoming phenomenon of big tech firms like Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and even Uber (NYSE: UBER) entering the financial field. The basic principles there are sound enough take firms that already reach huge markets of individuals and add a new service they might not have had available at all and as such, Pinto expects competition coming therein. </p><p>We had a look at the notion of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/are-you-ready-for-google-checking-account/\">Google checking account </url> back in November, and though we realized that Google isn't interested in being a bank, it likely is interested in providing some banking-related services, especially to the so-called  unbanked  or  underbanked. \u00a0 Pinto even pointed out that Facebook's controversial Libra cryptocurrency isn't likely as dead as some might think, and even JP Morgan itself is working on a similar project known as JPM Coin. Yet as we noted in earlier coverage of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/is-facebook-a-good-investment-right-now/\">Libra </url>, regulators are already considering it a direct competitor to actual currency. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Macro Picture Doesn't Look Bad Either</emphasis></p><p>Pinto also examined the broader picture both for JP Morgan and for the world economy as a whole. Pinto noted optimism about the ongoing US-China trade war, noting that the consumer sector is doing well. The economic returns we followed in the holiday shopping season proved that much out; our assertion that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/best-day-in-retail-yet-to-come-december-22/\">Super Saturday </url> would be the best day <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/3-retail-stocks-to-buy-for-2020-that-arent-amazon/\">holiday retail </url> saw this year proved sound as well. </p><p>Naturally, Pinto couldn't opine on the 2020s without examining his own firm. With JP Morgan now the biggest Wall Street firm in terms of revenue, the notion of the company getting bigger was advanced. Pinto is cautious about any further growth for the company, noting that lending money is now extremely expensive and doesn't offer the return that it did thanks to regulatory changes. Additionally, the fractured nature of the markets, and the world, means that conflicts emerge more often, and sometimes JP Morgan and the like have to refuse certain business just to prevent conflicts from taking place. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's All Up in the Air Right Now</emphasis><br/><br/>Like all attempts to predict the future, the best most anyone can do is to make guesses based on current conditions. Whether it's extrapolating current patterns like we did when we took a look at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nike-enters-2020-ahead-of-the-pack/\">Nike</url> (NYSE: NKE), who was entering 2020 ahead of much of its competition or trying to aggregate forward movement based on several separate factors, we're still just attempting to guess the future based on what we know. For instance, we project that stocks around companies that provide goods and services at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/nike-enters-2020-ahead-of-the-pack/\">consumer level </url> will shine in 2020, based on earlier-seen trends of consumer spending and a tight labor market going forward. </p><p>We also spotted value in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/three-reits-for-income-and-value-in-2020/\">real estate investment trusts </url> (REITs), as well as certain <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/top-three-value-stocks-for-2020/\">individual stocks </url> that are holding unusual positions within the market itself. Perhaps one of the greatest trends going into 2020 is sheer, raw optimism; <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.marketbeat.com/originals/oppenheimer-has-lead-on-s-and-p-optimism-in-2020/\">Oppenheimer Asset Management </url> analyst John Stoltzfus still projects an S&amp;P 500 of 3500 at some point in 2020. </p><p>Optimism seems to be the leading theme going into 2020, whether it's irrationally exuberant or merely cautious. It doesn't matter if you're Daniel Pinto or a regular investor; you're likely looking for 2020 to be a positive year when you come out on the other side. Looking at what we know so far about 2020, a certain amount of optimism may not be out of line. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AMBNWS-m4238819</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AMBNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CW-M501-DXK2-M32R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">439934</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 American Banking and Market News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>American Banking and Market News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 27, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE and here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The banking beat: JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs all beating earnings expectations with caveats. Pit on the Hill. Facebook set to face a grilling over new cryptocurrency, Libra. And not backing down. President Trump tackling the squad on Twitter this morning as party pressure mounts. It's only Tuesday, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. It is a banking bonanza session this week, of course and we are looking at all three banking earnings this morning. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs like I said, a mixed bag and we'll dig through the details very shortly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, let me give you a look at what we're seeing for futures right now. A very modest positive start to the session we're looking at right now after a low volume micro mini gain during the session yesterday. But it was enough though, to see fresh record highs for the U.S. majors.</p><p>Now it's all about Fed Speak this week, of course, and earnings season. Ten percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies, as I reminded you yesterday, reporting this week, but let's not forget the economic data. U.S. retail sales rising this morning some 0.4 percent on last month, twice the level of expected and the fourth straight month of gains.</p><p>The index, the consumer in the United States remain strong. It follows better than expected factory data on Monday, too. So it's going to be interesting to get the Feds take this week. But right now, I don't think any amount of good news derails the Fed rate cut in July.</p><p>What about what's going on in Europe? Though a positive day overall, despite some gloomy numbers from Germany, investor sentiment plunging yet again last month with the German export sector continuing to feel the trade war pain. A lesson for the Fed there too, perhaps that lower rates, negative rates, in fact, doesn't necessarily mean more growth.</p><p>But today, the question we're asking is whether low rates will help or hinder the banks and more importantly, lending, of course, to the real economy, because that's where we begin today's drivers. And Matt Egan joins us now.</p><p>The headline here, Matt, I think from all of these results, the U.S. consumer remains strong, but the trading desks are still a challenge. Though Goldman Sachs, let's start there seemed to buck the trend here of weaker trading revenues. Talk us through their results.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS LEAD WRITER: That's right, Julia. So, I think you mentioned this, a little bit of a mixed bag. But there are some common themes between the earnings that we've seen so far this week from the big banks.</p><p>Now, you mentioned the trading situation. Goldman Sachs really did buck the trend here. They were able to report increases in trading revenue. But that's the outlier. Really, we're seeing pressure from the other big banks.</p><p>And I think what that is, is it's a reflection of the fact that volatility has come down in capital markets. And while that's a great thing for the average investor, it means potentially higher correlations and lower trading volume, and so other than Goldman Sachs, we are seeing pressure there.</p><p>On the broader economy, though, as you mentioned, this slowdown that the Federal Reserve is responding to has not arrived in the American household. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was talking about how he sees positive momentum from U.S. consumers. They reported double digit increases in credit card sales, in merchant volume, and their deposits were up as well. We saw similar positive numbers from Citigroup as well.</p><p>And you know, the other point, though, and it goes back to the Fed is that bank profitability is under pressure from the yield curve and all these swings in interest rates.</p><p>And so JP Morgan, the reason why that stock is down, at last check about one and a half percent premarket is because they actually cut their outlook for net interest income, which is the difference that banks make on what they charge on loans and what they make on deposits.</p><p>And so, you know, that is an issue that I think we're going to continue to see going forward -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and this is exactly the point and we heard exactly the same from Wells Fargo, too. A warning here that that bank profitability, to your point, the amount that they can charge to allow people to borrow from them is going to go down. The question is does that impact the real economy hereto, because they simply a willing to lend less?</p><p>EGAN: That's right. I mean, that is something that we need to watch out for. Wells Fargo's net interest income was down during the quarter. Citigroup's margins in this area disappointed yesterday. And the interesting thing is that JPMorgan sort of signaled that its outlook may have to come down even further if the Fed cuts interest rates as many times as the market thinks.</p><p>So that's something that we'll have to watch. One other major driver -- one common theme here is that buybacks are really padding the bottom line here.</p><p>[09:05:08] EGAN: Wells Fargo said that it repurchased about $5 billion worth of stock during the second quarter. That was nearly double what it did the year before. But what's interesting is that you know, KDW put out a report yesterday and they said that if you take away buybacks, bank EPS growth would really vanish.</p><p>So that's something that we will need to monitor to see whether or not banks are able to continue to return capital.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Such a great point, Matt, and I know some people over in D.C. who will be eagerly watching those buyback numbers as well, because that's what we have next. Matt Egan, great job. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Two big hearings on Capitol Hill today. In the next hour, Facebook set to face questions over there new cryptocurrency, Libra and at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Big Tech executives will be grilled on whether or not they simply have too much market power, so called antitrust issues.</p><p>Brian Fung and Claire Sebastian are joining us on both of those stories. Clare, I'll start with you because Facebook faces the grilling first, lots of negative commentary, including former Secretary of the Treasury, of course, Stephen Mnuchin saying he has serious concerns about cryptocurrency, what can Facebook say today to allay some of those concerns, if anything?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia, they face a bipartisan show of skepticism, a barrage of criticism, as you say, going into this. We've had the Fed Chair saying there are serious concerns. We've had the President tweeting that he's not in favor of cryptocurrencies, that he sees Libra is lacking dependability. And all this culminated, as you say, yesterday in a hastily arranged press conference by the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, where he really laid it on quite thick with his criticism of Libra and Facebook, take a listen to what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: To the extent that Facebook can do this correctly, and can have a payment system, you know, correctly with proper MAL, that's fine. They've got a lot of work to do to convince us to get to that place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: So in response to that, Julia, what we're going to see today, from David Marcus, he is the head of Calibra, which is Facebook's unit that's going to build applications to use Libra. It's a show of really qualified humility. He says that he is going to wait for regulatory approval to launch the project. He says that they will be very sure that they comply with anti-money laundering regulations, and all of that, but he's also going to urge Congress not to overreact.</p><p>I want to pull up a quote from the prepared remarks that we've got from him. He says, \"I believe that if America does not lead in innovation in the digital currency and payments area, others will. If we fail to act, we could soon see a digital currency controlled by others whose values are dramatically different.\"</p><p>So he is basically saying, if we don't do it, someone else will and the U.S. needs to lead and this I think the implication being perhaps better the devil, you know, there.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and I completely agree. The remittances business needs disrupting and prices, rates need to come down. I'm simply not sure Facebook is the right company to do it. But we shall see. Clare, thank you for that.</p><p>Brian, come in here, too, because one of the big questions, of course, is going to be asked if the likes of Apple and Amazon, Google, do they simply have too much market power? Now, this hearing comes after I believe, months and months of investigation. So hopefully, the questions today aren't going to be as lame as perhaps they have been in the past. Am I allowed to say that? Yes, I did. Brian, what can we expect?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECH REPORTER: Well, I think that's the hope here. We're seeing here a hearing and then compared to the last hearing in the series, it tackles a much bigger question, which is, you know, just how much power do these tech platforms have in terms of potentially stifling competition and strangling startups?</p><p>You know, the last hearing in this series was very narrowly focused on the technology sector's impact on local journalism. This is a much bigger set of questions here that lawmakers are going to try and get the tech companies to answer and you have, you know, Apple, and Amazon, sending members of their legal teams to testify. You have Facebook and Google sending members of their policy teams.</p><p>In addition to that, you know, you've got a number of outside academics, industry experts and former government officials who are all going to be weighing in providing context to this question. So it's going to be very interesting to see this issue outlined in much broader strokes than you know, perhaps we've seen in previous hearings in this series.</p><p>What we're going to see today is a much bigger reckoning for Silicon Valley, as it grapples with this massive question about what government lawmakers should do in terms of regulation, or new policies or perhaps even a breakup of some of these companies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a huge question. The question comes, ultimately, is the consumer harmed by this because if you want to take antitrust action, that's what you have to prove. And it believes it will take years. Thank you very much there to Clare Sebastian and Brian Fung, of course, and we will continue to talk about this all throughout the day on TV.</p><p>But we've also got you covered it on the digital side, too. You can go to cnn.com/businesstowatch. Both hearings live if you want to do that. So we've got you covered on all aspects.</p><p>[09:10:10] CHATTERLEY: And now though, let's move on and talk about some of the other stories that are making headlines around the world.</p><p>Donald Trump has taken to Twitter yet again to renew his attacks on four Congresswomen. This morning he accused him of making statements that are anti-Israel, anti-USA and pro-terrorist. He also questioned why the House isn't voting to rebuke what he called quote, \"the filthy and hate laced things they have said,\" alluding to an expected vote in the House over whether to condemn the President's recent tweets.</p><p>Joe John joins us once again from Washington. Oh, Joe, I don't even know what to say about this at this stage. What we saw yesterday was the squad of course, these four Congresswoman fighting back in a press conference last night, but the President of course, continuing to tweet this morning. What about this vote? Where do you think this goes next?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Well, we do know the House of Representatives is controlled by Democrats. And these are Democrats who've been attacked by the President and reading through that resolution, well, certainly it's going to be nonbinding and not enforceable or actionable.</p><p>It quotes a variety of Presidents, Founding Fathers of the United States, and then it sort of gets down to the meat of the language at the very bottom referring to President Trump's racist comments, and saying he has increased fear and hatred of new Americans and people of color by saying our fellow Americans who are immigrants and those who may look like immigrants, the President says should go back to other countries.</p><p>So strong language there from them and that is obviously about the only thing they can do because this President has repeatedly said stuff like this, though, these words are probably some of the most fierce partly because he is now President of the United States, partly because of course, these are duly elected Members of Congress he is talking about.</p><p>I think, the overlay, if you will, of course, as presidential politics has been just about a month since the President made his official announcement for his reelection campaign and all of that indicates is that we're likely to see this kind of thing more in the future -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, Joe it's a great point. It's the prison that we have to look through this rhetoric in order to understand really what's going on here.</p><p>But you know, when I look at all the commentary that's coming out from whoever here, no one -- no one represents the whole here, how do we move away from this and get back to policy and talk about things like the looming debt ceiling, which is, you know, another big issue that the White House and that Congress here needs to tackle?</p><p>JOHNS: Right, there are a whole variety of very serious issues that the President and the Congress needs to deal with and rather quickly as a matter of fact, but we also know that the August recess for the United States Congress is coming up pretty fast as well. So it's not that likely that they're going to get a whole lot done before August.</p><p>And the debt ceiling obviously is one of those things that has to be dealt with. But all this language does is make it a little bit harder for the President and the Democrats on the House side to get together to accomplish anything productive, so you can say that it has probably made it worse.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, my head is shaking. Joe Johns, thank you so much for joining us once again. All right, let's move on. Floods and landslides have killed more than 100 people in Nepal, India and Bangladesh. As you see here, villagers are inundated with water. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced and six million people impacted after torrential monsoon rains began to over the weekend and triggered flooding.</p><p>A rescue operation is underway in Mumbai after a four-story building collapsed leaving up to 25 people trapped in the rubble. We are told at least four people are dead, nine people have been rescued so far. The cause of the collapse is not yet known. Mumbai and surrounding areas faced devastating floods just a week ago as we were mentioning there.</p><p>The E.U. Parliament will vote later today on approving the new European Commission President. If Ursula von der Leyen prevails, she will become the first woman to hold the job which oversees the body that shapes E.U. policy. Von der Leyen is Germany's outgoing Defense Minister.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE. But still to come, from low budget to perhaps no budget, RyanAir cutting capacity in the wake of the Boeing jet crisis. And as Facebook feel the heat on the Hill, one tech Titan tells us point blank, Libra is a mistake. That's coming up on First Move. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:18:03] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We're looking at a slightly positive open for U.S. stocks this morning. We didn't see much gains yesterday, but we did manage to eke out fresh record highs.</p><p>We've also had stronger retail sales data than expected from the United States this morning, and the major banks of course reporting, as we've been discussing, beating earnings as far as the headline numbers are concerned. But as we saw and discussed earlier, the trading desk, of course, still pressured. And they have to tackle the low rate environment right now.</p><p>Interesting that we spend a lot of time talking about the $12 trillion worth of sovereign debt that has negative yields. What about $600 billion worth of corporate debt that has negative yields, mostly in Europe?</p><p>Lots to discuss here. Joining us now, Alicia Levine, she is Chief Strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. Always great to have you on the show.</p><p>ALICIA LEVINE, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT BNY MELLON INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT: Thanks for having me back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You've been writing lists, and I love them. What's in the price here for investors and what isn't? Talk me through what's in the price? Because there's a lot of expectations, high expectations about rate cuts, about no inflation ever again and earnings upgrades, too?</p><p>LEVINE: That's right. So I like making lists because it's a good way of keeping yourself honest, when you think about valuations in the market. And when you think about putting in fresh capital on a particular day, what is it that you're actually buying?</p><p>So right now investors are buying for rate cuts through the end of 2020. They are buying all the earnings power for 2019 coming in that fourth quarter. They're buying in 11 percent earnings increase for 2020. And they're buying a trade deal sometime in the autumn. And they're not buying no trade deal, right? So they're buying some trade deal.</p><p>They're buying inflation will never spike again, we will have low inflation forever. It's gone forever. And you know, so you have to ask yourself is all the good news in the market? And the other thing that's really not being priced in that a particular sector is pricing in is a more leftist government being voted in 2020.</p><p>So I'm not going to name names here, because we don't do that.</p><p>[09:20:05] CHATTERLEY: I do. Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren potentially and we know this just by the rhetoric that they say.</p><p>LEVINE: That's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: We can ignore that and move on.</p><p>LEVINE: So Corporate America should be worried about this. So the healthcare sector has already priced this in, and the healthcare sector has been underperforming, but the rest of the market has not. And so you have to ask the question like, how likely is it that we get a Democratic candidate that is more leftist than what this country has normally been used to? And what that means for corporate earnings and for corporate America?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, I just love that you're pinpointing all of these things and it's not just about the politics, it's a hugely important one. But as you were pointing out there, there is a lot of good news baked into the cake or assumed at this stage.</p><p>Let's talk about rate cuts then, how likely is it that the Fed -- and I think everyone now expects them to cut in July. What's the likelihood or the probability that they only cut rate once, because that's rare.</p><p>LEVINE: It is very rare. So I do see a second rate cut by September because the pricing -- the inflation issue really is pretty low. I mean, we just had import prices this morning and they were pretty low. So I do think there's a second rate cut, you rarely get one cut.</p><p>But you know, the issue is, then you're taking some of your dry powder away for in case there is a recession one day. I do think it's the right move that rate of increase in December was probably a mistake. So they've got to take that one back.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Does it help at the margin? Because we've been talking about the banks and whether or not actually lowering rates at this stage will mean that the banks end up lending less? I mean, Germany news, this is a great example of where negative rates actually doesn't necessarily stimulate the economy enough.</p><p>LEVINE: That's right. So Germany is a great example, and Europe overall is a great example of the lowest rates you could possibly have. It has not really been able to simulate the real economy nor have they been able to increase the multiples that investors pay, you know, for the equity markets.</p><p>So you have to ask the question like that one to one correspondence that we all make, what is the transmission mechanism actually that low rates are going to consume this market and that we are expected to stabilize the economy?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, the transition rates in Europe are very different, that the structure of the banking sector is very different to the United States. But do you think on the margin, it helps banks and it helps lending here in the United States? Because the President arguably is someone who really believes that lower rates here will help.</p><p>LEVINE: So he is right about one thing, the Fed needs to cut to steepen the yield curve. The Fed must get rid of that inversion on the front end and cutting rates will do that. And ultimately, that will be positive for the banks.</p><p>In the short term, you've seen with some of the earnings that the net interest margins are coming down by $500 million. It should not be a surprise, though. This is not a surprise. But you've got to get -- the Fed has to get rid of the inversion. Two rate cuts will do it. Three actually would be better.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What's going to surprise us in earnings season, do you think? Where is the value when you look either around the world or you look at perhaps where investors should be looking at this moment?</p><p>LEVINE: Look, I think the U.S. consumer, we had data as you pointed out this morning. Look the Americans like to shop. Your audience knows, our people like to shop and the consumers, 70 percent of the U.S. economy, and that is going to prop up the economy.</p><p>And the question is, can the strength in the consumer side and make up for the weakness in the industrial side and the weakness globally on the industrial side? My bet is yes.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>LEVINE: My bet is yes. Do you see that the global data stabilizing?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: If my shopping habits are anything to go by, I'd say yes, too.</p><p>LEVINE: We're supporting the economy here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Exactly. Single handedly. Alicia Levine, always a pleasure. Thank you for that.</p><p>LEVINE: Thanks, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, let's move on now and look at the airline sector. Ryanair specifically feeling the pain from the MAX 737 jets grounding. It is saying it has to trim its 2020 growth plans. Investors though seemingly unfazed, which is interesting, the shares in Dublin some two percent higher almost. Anna Stewart joins me now.</p><p>Interesting, Anna, when a company says look, we're having a real problem. We have to cut capacity here and investors go, \"Oh, great. That might help in the performance.\" Interesting.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, but this program wasn't really surprise, was it? The Boeing 737 MAX delays is so well forecast and actually I think investors are quite relieved at how conservative Ryanair are being here. They were meant to have 58 delivered in time for the summer schedule next year. Now they only expect 30. That's because the FAA has to go through the certification. Did I say that right, Julia? They need to go through the whole process.</p><p>They expect some in September, it could take the end of the year. They don't expect their planes to be delivered until the beginning of next year. They've cut the growth forecast some 73 percent, but that was no surprise, but what was, Julia was when they said that they might cut back operations at some airports and abandon others entirely.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's an interesting one for me. I mean, we know that there is no substitute here for the Boeing 737 MAX, but the idea that you cut capacity to such an extent. Interesting for negotiations going forward if you try and add them back, what else?</p><p>We've also got United Airlines here in the United States reporting and this is another airline that's had to cut capacity, canceled flights as a result of the MAX jet crisis. What should we expect from these guys, Anna, because I know you've been looking at these numbers, too?</p><p>STEWART: Well, generally, Julia, we're expecting quite strong robust earnings later today that should make up for any issues around the 737 MAX. It's actually a very small proportion of the overall fleet, around two percent. So, they're not nearly as impacted as the likes of American or Southwest. So we get those out after the bell.</p><p>In terms of Europe, looking at all the sector for aviation prices up today, it is really interesting how they are all really pleased with what Ryanair said, essentially reducing capacity in Europe means that ticket prices are likely going to go up, not just at Ryanair, but for the rivals as well.</p><p>And if you want to be really cynical with today's news from Ryanair, you could also look at the fact that announcing that they're going to renegotiate contracts or have discussions with airports that are underperforming and suggest that they might be trying to get some better deals.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Or even raise ticket prices perhaps, Anna, as well but we would never be skeptical, would we? Ever. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, we are counting down to the market open this morning. The banks very much front and center. Goldman Sachs looks set for a bit of a pop here. JPMorgan, under a little pressure premarket. We will have the open for you in just a few moments' time and plenty more to come on the show. You're watching FIRST MOVE. Stay with CNN.</p><p>[09:30:00] CHATTERLEY: Lots more smiling faces here on Tuesday at the New York Stock Exchange and that was the opening bell. We were expecting a pretty flat start to the trading session today. Remember, anything in the plus column today means a fresh record high for these U.S. majors. So keep that in mind as we see this session progress.</p><p>We also had some strong retail sales numbers out from the United States, as we were talking through with Alicia there. The U.S. consumer remains strong, up some 0.4 percent in June. Numbers are better even if you strip out the gas component there.</p><p>You could even see a boost to Q2 growth estimates here in the United States, to also on the inflation front, U.S. import prices falling almost one percent last month. What's the Fed going to make this? Well, it clears the way again, for that rate cut in July, of course, and we're gearing up for plenty of Fed Speak, including Jay Powell, of course today speaking on monetary policy before that quiet period begins this weekend.</p><p>All right, so let's take a look at some of our global movers in the session today. Alphabet shares in focus falling on a tweet from President Trump this morning saying his administration will look into the billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel's claim that Google committed quote, \"treason.\"</p><p>Thiel accused the search engine of working with China. You remember, we talked about that story on the show yesterday. Well, Alphabet in focus now.</p><p>JPMorgan, also under a bit of pressure here. The bank posting a record Q2 profits, $6.9 billion. That was a 16 percent jump year-on-year. However, it also posted a fourth straight drop in fixed income trading revenue, and it warned that lending income will fall in the second half of this year. And that was the key I think, for what investors are reacting to today.</p><p>Domino's Pizza, the pizza chain. Same store sales growth missed estimates. They've been adding stores in order to achieve faster delivery. They added nearly 200 stores during the quarter. Skeptics are arguing over the tactics are hurting the same store sale growth. Are they cannibalizing purchases from existing stores? It's an interesting question.</p><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson profits jumping some 42 percent in the second quarter, all of the three business units beating expectations here, of course, but it does come as the company is facing a handful of legal issues and we've discussed those, of course on the show before.</p><p>All right. Let's move on here. She's a former presidential candidates. The first woman ever in fact to lead a Fortune 50 company and is an author of three books. Carly Fiorina is our next guest.</p><p>Fiorina is best known for her six-year tenure as the CEO of tech company, Hewlett Packard. Her term began in 1999, a year after Google, in fact was founded. It then ended in 2005, just 12 months after Mark Zuckerberg launched Facebook.</p><p>So as Congress begins two days of hearings on antitrust issues in the tech sector and Facebook's cryptocurrency, Libra. I asked Fiorina for her take on the industry since her time and for what she thinks of Facebook's latest venture into cryptocurrencies. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLY FIORINA, AUTHOR: I have long known that power concentrated is power abused, it's always true. If you concentrate too much power in too few hands that power will be abused.</p><p>It's true in politics, and it's true in business. And so when I look at the tech sector, what I see now is too much power concentrated into few hands.</p><p>The power that companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google have over our lives, over information, the concentration that they have achieved, in many cases by gobbling up others, in many cases by not earning a profit in the stock market letting that go on for years and years and years because the market focused only on growth. They have amassed enormous power.</p><p>And so it's not enough for a founder or a CEO like Mark Zuckerberg to say, \"Trust me, I have good intentions. It's simply not enough. And so I do think we've come to the point now where there has to be some transparency and accountability over all that concentrated power.</p><p>And that can only come through some level of regulation and requirement. I believe one regulates to a floor not to a ceiling. And what I mean by that is a minimum set of expectations need to be regulated. Expectations about how information is treated, expectations about information that is provided, expectations about the power that a consumer will always have and the accountability that they can demand from these companies.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How many years does that take if we be honest to yourselves, and as you said, business is tied to politics, the lobby power is so huge. How many years does it take?</p><p>[09:35:14] FIORINA: Yes, well, it is enormous power concentrated in the tech sector. And of course, the tech sector has been very smart about providing enormous dollars, principally over time to the Democratic Party who normally would be pushing for regulation and who has not and don't think it's a coincidence.</p><p>And of course, Republicans have been wanting to get money from the tech sector. So it does take a long time, and what I think it takes is wisdom. And that's not always true in politics, either.</p><p>What I actually would recommend is that these companies step forward and provide some guidance, instead of just saying, \"No, no, no,\" is to get engaged in the problem solving process. Because if they don't engage in it, something will happen to them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When you look at Facebook and they step forward, and they announced at this moment that they're going to launch their own cryptocurrency. I mean, there's a huge irony here. What do you think when Facebook announces something so huge, is this, so pivotal, potentially is this?</p><p>FIORINA: Well, first, I think over the long run, it will be a mistake. Now that's a bold statement to make. It the short run, it may be hugely successful, but in the long run, I think what it will do is continue to raise concerns and it will continue to make people uncomfortable.</p><p>My goodness, now without any banks involved, without any information, they're suddenly getting into money as well? I think over time, this is going to be a problem for them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Increased scrutiny as a result of a foray into cryptocurrency for Facebook. It's an interesting point. Now, cast your mind back to 2016 and Carly Fiorina ran for the Republican presidential nomination.</p><p>If you remember, it was the same election that saw Hillary Clinton make history as the first woman ever to be nominated as a presidential candidate. I spoke to Carly before the recent controversy over comments made by the U.S. President Donald Trump about four nonwhite U.S. Congresswomen, which of course many have condemned is racist.</p><p>But what she had to say about running as a woman and differences in politics and the treatment, I think of women versus men, seems pretty pertinent, in light of what we've seen. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FIORINA: When you're different, it's different. It's always true. When you're different, it's different. The scrutiny is different. The criticism is different, the expectations are different, the commentary is different.</p><p>I think the women who are running in this cycle, are doing a very good job of getting their voices heard. Their voices are getting a lot of attention and that is a very good thing. And yet, it will be a different experience for them than it will be for the men.</p><p>This is something I've dealt with all my life, people used to ask me, \"Aren't you nervous being the only woman on the debate stages?\" And you know, honestly, it's the story of my life. I've usually been the only woman in the room.</p><p>But it's true that when I left the debate stage, sometimes people would ask my team, what shoes I was wearing, or the designer of my dress. I don't think they asked the male candidates that.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you don't need to talk to me about that. I understand that completely. Do you think -- do you think a woman like Kamala Harris could actually take the Democratic nomination and ultimately win the presidency? Do you think we could see that?</p><p>FIORINA: I think we can see a woman President, I think it's possible that a woman will win the Democratic nomination. I think the issue is going to be when we get to the general and we have a long way to go and many things can happen.</p><p>I think in the end, what it will come down to on the general election is the positions of each side. And so I think if the Democrats continue to list further and further to the left, and are actually advocating the elimination of private health insurance or the opening of all of our borders, I think those are going to be losing positions.</p><p>But is the country ready for a woman President if she espouses the right positions? Yes, I think they are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Carly has written three books. Her latest is called \"Find Your Way: Unleash Your Power and Highest Potential.\" I also what her years at the top of business and her experience with politics has taught her about leadership.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FIORINA: I've learned more than anything that leadership is not about position or title. We tend to call people leaders because they've achieved a big position and they hold a big title. But the truth is, that's not what makes them a leader, and there are a lot of people with titles who don't lead.</p><p>Leadership in the end is about problem solving. It's about seeing possibilities. It's in particular about unlocking potential in other people so that they can help change the order of things for the better. The purpose of leadership is problem solving in fact.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Carly Fiorina there. All right, we're going to take a quick break again here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up the journey from tweets to Uber Eats. We speak to Twitter's cofounder about his latest company and its partnership with the ride hailing firm. Stay with CNN.</p><p>CARLSON:</p><p>CHATTERLEY: \"Skip the line,\" that's the slogan of Olo, a platform that integrates online orders into the workflow of a busy restaurant kitchen. The company works with 250 restaurant brands and has recently skipped the line to partner with Uber Eats.</p><p>Joining us in the chat room is the company's cofounder and CEO Noah Glass. Noah, fantastic to have you with us. I mean you worked with a lot of these guys. Postmates, Caviar, DoorDash, but it does feel like Uber Eats is a pretty big swinger in this area.</p><p>NOAH GLASS, COFOUNDER AND CEO, OLO: It is, yes. Uber Eats is part of a cohort of companies that are helping restaurants to get into the world of delivery where they don't have delivery capacity in-house. So the restaurants able to just prepare the food, have it ready and waiting for the driver. The driver picks it up and then takes it directly from the restaurant to the consumer that's opening up this on demand experience to consumers all across the United States.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So what is Olo? Tell me about what the technology is and what your platform provides to these guys that, as you said, are providing a sort of conduit to restaurants and to consumers that basically can't be bothered to go to a restaurant or wants to see food delivered.</p><p>GLASS: That's right. Well, we're the -- Olo is the leading digital ordering platform and delivery enablement platform for restaurant brands all across the country. There are now over 70,000 restaurants that use the Olo platform to allow their consumers to order ahead, pay ahead and get their food faster at the restaurant or now get it delivered to them.</p><p>So these are brands like Wing Stop and Shake Shack and Sweet Green, brands you probably order from every day. We're not a consumer brands, so it's our technology that's powering that experience, and really enabling restaurants to play in this world of on-demand, the smartphone as the remote control for buying things around you and meet the needs of that consumer who now doesn't want to go to the restaurant sometimes, but wants the food to come to them.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, you've seen huge growth in the number of orders that you're processing. I saw a great statistic, 100 million orders in the 12 and a half years to last year when you doubled that last year. So I mean, the exponential growth that you're seeing here is phenomenal.</p><p>GLASS: Yes, yes, we saw a hundred million transactions last year across our platform, a hundred million, again, the first six months of this year. So the exponential growth just continues.</p><p>We've been around for 14 years. We were actually founded June 1, 2005. Trivia, 25 years to the day after CNN was founded. But the company has been doubling every year, and we see that continuing as part of the seismic shift towards digital ordering and delivery and really off premise food consumption.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Who pays? Do you get a cut of the orders that are put through, because when you mentioned Shake Shack, Sweet Green, McDonald's is another one, I'm sure, I mean, the power that these guys have to perhaps push back on how much they pay you is far greater than an individual restaurant would be able to do, but would still like to be able to use your services.</p><p>GLASS: Well, our platform is not a commission based platform. It's not a 20 to 30 percent commission on every order. Rather, it's a software platform. And that's in the software as a service mold. So the brands are paying a flat fee per store per month, out of the corporate stores or the franchisees and there's a small transaction fee associated with the delivery transactions that come across our platform and that's what's really growing quickly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What does the future hold? What's the most exciting thing to you? Is it possibility of perhaps one of these big companies taking you in-house like an Uber Eat and letting everybody else use your platform? Or do you intend to stay independent and doing your thing?</p><p>GLASS: So I've been doing this for 14 years, we've been a company for 14 years, we want to stay independent for the long term. We think we're in the very early innings of what is a massive shift in the way that consumers like to eat. And it's really incumbent on us to stay independent and to be an open platform and to work with all the restaurants that want to use the platform, all the point of sale companies, all the delivery companies, everybody using Olo as a common carrier is really our vision of the status quo and also the future.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Very quickly. Are you profitable?</p><p>GLASS: We don't cover those financials publicly. I should say that we're in a very strong position with a very strong balance sheet. We did a funding round at the end of last year, but it wasn't for funds for the company. It was just for long term early employees in the company. And the company didn't take any money.</p><p>This is a round that we did with Tiger Global, which has been a great investor in the tech space, but the food tech space, specifically.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The hint from that is that you're definitely more than breaking even if you didn't need it for the operating of the business, Noah. We'll get you back because I want to talk autonomous technology and what impact that going to happen forward, too. Noah Glass, thank you so much for that.</p><p>GLASS: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, South Korea maybe one of the most high tech countries on Earth, but when it comes to energy, it's still very much stuck in the past. Fascinating. Look at this.</p><p>As John Defterios explains the gears of change is slowly grinding paving the way for renewable energy in South Korea. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: If you think about it, South Korea is a victim of its own success. Growth has been driven by making autos, computer chips, mobile phones, telecommunications equipment, even steel, but the common link here is they're all energy intensive.</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): It's no locally as the Han River Dynasty, South Korea's six-decade long Industrial Revolution.</p><p>From the ashes of the Korean War to Asian economic tiger. But in the land of Kpop sensations and all things high tech, South Korea remains very 20th Century when it comes to energy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (on camera): Why was it slow adapting to the renewable energy market would you say?</p><p>KIM DONG-SEOP, CEO, RENEWABLE ENERGY DEPARTMENT, SHINSUNG E&amp;G: Korean people enjoyed low price of electricity due to coal generation and the nuclear generation, but because of the social issues like air pollution, the people start to appreciate the value of renewable energy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): Shinsung makes cutting edge solar cells they say can boost average output by 25 percent. After a dozen years of sluggish growth due to intense competition from China, these shipments are destined for the United States and Canada as demand rises.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEOP: Six hundred thirty kilowatt solar panels on the roof top.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS (voice over): CEO Kim shows me how the sun powers 40 percent of their own operational needs. But that is certainly not the norm in the country. The government's goal is to more than triple solar and wind energy by 2030. John Defterios, CNN, Seoul.</p><p>[09:52:20] CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE on a look at today's at \"Boardroom Brief.\" A U.S. federal judges slashed the damages Bayer is to pay out in a case relating to the weed killer, Roundup.</p><p>The German firm had been ordered to pay more than $80 million to a California man who claimed it caused his cancer. However the judge reduced the award to just over $25 million. Bayer says it's still plans to appeal.</p><p>Burberry's new chief designer, Riccardo Tisci is providing bumper booster sales. Revenue is up by four percent in the three months to the end of June, double what was expected. Burberry's latest collection under him are proving popular in China, which accounts for up to four 40 percent of sales.</p><p>Tesla shares are falling after the company announced yet another tweak of the pricing models, it is down some -- what? Nine tenths of one percent. Peter Valdes-Dapena joins me now.</p><p>Peter, I was trying to pour into the details of this. I think the base now price for the Model S and the X is significantly more expensive. But for the Model 3, the standard is a bit lower. Do I have that right?</p><p>PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR AUTO WRITER: That sounds about right. Clearly, Tesla's Model 3 is the driving force these days behind Tesla sales. So what Tesla is trying to do here really is simplify its lineup of Model S and X cars which are getting less popular.</p><p>But at the same time, you know, they're moving towards the longer -- long range versions of those cars, which are going to be the base model, which makes sense because the long range version really doesn't have a bigger battery pack than the standard versions. It just had more efficient parts.</p><p>So it makes sense, I think to drop that less efficient version from the lineup, maybe push the Model X and S up market which I think is what they're doing, concentrate more on the Model 3 and the upcoming Model Y crossover SUV.</p><p>In all, they're just trying to make their manufacturing job I think a bit easier.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, I looked at the crew in one car magazine, and one analyst was saying, quote, \"Tesla's chaotic pricing strategy is kind of a running joke at this point.\" Peter, do you agree with that? I mean, if you were a consumer going into a car lot and haggling with a salesperson or shifting around and trying to do these things in a way that Tesla doesn't, because it doesn't have a sort of marketing, a broader spend on marketing strategy, this would be happening. Tesla just does it up front. Do you agree with that?</p><p>VALDES-DAPENA: I certainly agree with that. Tesla does have upfront pricing, but it almost depends on whether I go buy a car this week or next week what the available option packages are. The confusing thing is somewhat as Tesla, unlike pretty much every other auto manufacturer doesn't use a model year system.</p><p>[09:55:02] VALDES-DAPENA: Tesla doesn't say the 2019 Model X is different from the 2018 Model X and here are the differences and here is the pricing. Every other automaker does that on a year-by-year basis.</p><p>Tesla kind of makes these changes to the lineup and the technology on a running basis. I think, I've actually said before, I think it might be a good idea for Tesla to follow the auto industry model here and start doing this on an annual basis so customers understand year by year. This is what I'm getting with this vehicle. This is what the price is, we're not going to have another big pricing change until the next model year.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we're on the same page. Peter Valdes-Dapena, however, how I paid $20,000.00 to get that ludicrous package thrown in, I might have a problem because that now gets thrown in for free, but we shall see. Peter, it's great to have you with us.</p><p>All right quick look at the markets as we head towards the end of the show. I make that fresh record highs, positive territory any gain today, for the Dow, not for the S&amp;P 500. Watch this space.</p><p>That was it the FIRST MOVE. Time to go make yours.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019071601cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKG-7NS1-JB20-G3PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7731\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

That\u2019s how much Joe Biden \u2019s presidential campaign raised after naming Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) as his running mate.   \u201cIt\u2019s really palpable, the excitement,\u201d Biden said the day after Harris joined the ticket.   Oh, that\u2019s not all.   Act Blue, the fundraising platform for Democrats, processed almost $11 million in just four hours after Biden picked Harris. That\u2019s a record.   And get this \u2014 in the first 24 hours after Harris joined the ticket, Biden\u2019s campaign got 150,000 people who had never given a dime to Biden to reach into their pockets.   So, I guess I was wrong about Harris.   I thought Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the smart pick to unify the party by expanding the Biden tent to include her supporters as well as fans of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).   Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) also seemed to have other ideas.   The man who saved the Biden candidacy with his endorsement in the South Carolina primary is said to have preferred Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.). His thinking seemed to be that Bass was a better bet to unify the party because of her leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus and ties to advocacy groups on the left.   As Biden looked over the field at a time of nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, Harris\u2019 work as a prosecutor in California did her no favors.   Critics said she was slow to investigate police shootings and noted that she appealed a ruling that the death penalty is unconstitutional.   And then she butted heads with Chris Dodd, a leader on Biden\u2019s vice-presidential selection team.   Harris famously refused to kowtow to Dodd, the former senator, when he asked her if she had remorse for smacking Biden in the first debate. She said it was just hardball politics when she knocked Biden for opposing mandatory school busing in the 1970s.   And there was grumbling about her failure in the race for the Democratic nomination.   She went into the race as a leading contender. But her campaign was poorly organized. And she never generated enthusiasm among voters, specifically black voters.   Remember, she dropped out before the first primary vote.   Okay, but now those problems are in the past. Harris is joining a strong, existing campaign organization.   Her ties to Black Lives Matter activists have also improved. During her speech accepting the nomination, she memorably said: \u201cThere is no vaccine for racism.\u201d She also read out loud the names of victims of police brutality, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.   But even now there is concern about her past waffling on issues, most of all Medicare for All.   You can expect Vice President Pence to mention in their debate that Harris backed Sanders\u2019 single-payer health plan in the Senate before changing her position in the primaries.   As a candidate, she shifted to a plan described by the Wall Street Journal as a \u201cgovernment-run health care system that would maintain a limited role for private plans.\u201d   Pence will also remind union members that while Biden supports the U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal that President Trump negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Harris voted against the deal. She said it lacked environmental protections.   Those splits contributed to the Biden camp\u2019s surprisingly long deliberations over naming a vice president.   Harris was the early favorite. But questions about her waffling led critics to argue her ambition was greater than her principles. That allowed other candidates to rise and fall as the flavor of the day among Biden\u2019s inner circle.   Still, Harris consistently scored well with former President Obama, who counseled Biden on the pick.   Now all the hesitation looks crazy.   With the excitement Harris is generating \u2014 especially among black women and immigrants but also white women \u2014 and the flood of donations, she is clearly the right pick.   Note the importance of her support from suburban white women. The Democrats\u2019 big win in the 2018 midterms, reclaiming the majority in the House, was based on those suburbanites. Already, 59 percent of female suburbanites disapprove of Trump, according to a July Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.   And then there is the element of relief in Harris\u2019 selection for deep pocketed, mostly white corporate donors who are much more at ease with Harris than with Warren\u2019s tough approach to big tech monopolies and Wall Street regulation.   Harris even got a backhanded endorsement from Trump when he said her tough questioning of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was \u201cextraordinarily nasty.\u201d   As Biden said at his first event with Harris: \u201cIs anyone surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman?\u201d   Harris is the first woman of color \u2014 and only the fourth woman \u2014 to appear on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket.   \u201cYet so many of the Black women who helped secure that victory [passage of the 19 th Amendment giving women the right to vote a hundred years ago] were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification,\u201d Harris recounted in her acceptance speech.   \u201cBut they were undeterred. Without fanfare or recognition, they organized, testified, rallied, marched, and fought \u2014 not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.\u201d   Welcome to the biggest campaign table of all, Sen. Harris.

Last fall, Gabbard sued the company for allegedly infringing on her right to free speech by temporarily suspending her campaign's ad account. The Gabbard campaign, Tulsi Now, Inc., sought $50 million in damages. Tuesday, US District Judge Stephen Wilson rejected the case, explaining that the campaign \"fails to state a claim that is legally sufficient to implicate the First Amendment\" and failed to show \"how Google's regulation of its own platform is in any way equivalent to a governmental regulation of an election.\"TULSI2020: In the hours following the 1st debate, while millions of Americans searched for info about Tulsi, Google suspended her search ad account w/o explanation. It is vital to our democracy that big tech companies can't affect the outcome of elections       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9\">https://t.co/n7Y7y2dQZ9</url>[2] \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) July 25, 2019[3] Google originally explained that it suspended the Tulsi Now, Inc. </p><p>ad account for suspicious activity. There was a sudden increase in spending after the first Democratic debate, and Google's system automatically flagged the account, which was reinstated shortly.\"We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters, and we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology,\" a Google spokesperson said at the time.As Wilson pointed out, it's common for tech companies to have some sort of automated system to detect cybercrime, and under Gabbard's argument, \"every media organization that took steps to prevent foreign cybercrimes could potentially implicate the First Amendment.\"\"Google's self-regulation, even of topics that may be of public concern, does not implicate the First Amendment,\" he wrote.This isn't all that surprising, as Gabbard's case never really had a chance. But it's worth noting that Facebook has since used a similar argument -- characterizing paid political advertising as free speech[4] -- to defended its decision to allow politicians to lie[5] in political ads.

The market had a really nice rally at about 11 o'clock and then it all dwindled away, and now just off 23 points, not a huge fall by any means. Earnings and all the usual things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We can't get excited by 26 points off on the Dow. The markets and there are many reasons and undercurrents going on today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark Zuckerberg makes his pitch to House lawmakers. They are skeptical about Facebook's plan for global cryptocurrency and political ads.</p><p>Boeing says it expect the 737 MAX to fly again by the end of the year. Families of many of those killed in two major crashes say it should stay grounded.</p><p>And not so fast -- IBM pushes back against Google's claim that it has cracked quantum computing.</p><p>Tonight, we are live in London on Wednesday, October 23rd. I'm Richard Quest, and of course, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. We start tonight, President Trump has announced he is lifting all sanctions against Turkey, after it agreed to stop fighting the Kurds in Northern Syria. He was at the White House, and the President took credit for the decision Turkey ultimately made after striking a deal with Russia.</p><p>The President called it an outcome created by the United States and nobody else. Donald Trump warns that if Turkey does not honor its pledge for a permanent ceasefire, he will not hesitate to re-impose sanctions.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If Turkey failed to honor its obligations including the protection of religious and ethnic minorities, which I truly believe, they will do, we reserve the right to re-impose crippling sanctions, including substantially increased tariffs on steel and all other products coming out of Turkey.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Ryan Browne is with me from Washington. Ryan, forgive me, there's no evidence is there that these sanctions were crippling or otherwise, or indeed that they had taken effect?</p><p>RYAN BROWNE, CNN PENTAGON REPORTER: Well, that's absolutely right, Richard. In fact, many on Capitol Hill and elsewhere criticize the White House's sanctions when they were first announced for being much too lenient.</p><p>In fact, they had very little impact. They were actually waivers granted. So some of the items that might have had impact on foreign military sales, for instance, the sale of arms to Turkey, there were waivers granted for that so they could avoid those.</p><p>So again, there was a lot of criticism about those sanctions when they were first announced, that they weren't tough enough. It's not clear at all that this is what changed Ankara's calculus.</p><p>Now, in Capitol Hill, lawmakers are pursuing much stronger sanctions, much tougher sanctions that they still think they may want to impose on Turkey, unless Turkey returns to its positions before it launched this operation, something Turkey has said it will not do.</p><p>QUEST: I was struck by the fact in that whole conversation, that whole statement in which he didn't take questions, the President -- I'm not sure the word Russia passed his lips.</p><p>BROWNE: Well, that's right, Richard. He seems to not be willing to acknowledge that Russia has benefited from the U.S. decision to pull back in Turkey's incursion. Russia has already taken over several former U.S. military installations in Syria, something that is featured within Russian propaganda.</p><p>And so the President not willing to acknowledge that Russia has struck this deal with Turkey. He did make a broader comment about countries in the region, kind of sorting it out. So he seems -- but he doesn't seem particularly concerned, unlike many U.S. military leaders, lawmakers in Capitol Hill about Russia's growing influence as a result of this situation. President Trump does not appear to be particularly concerned about that either.</p><p>QUEST: Ryan, thank you. Good to see you tonight. Boeing says it expects American regulators will allow the 737 MAX to fly again and by the end of the year. A plan in the company -- to gradually increase production in 2020. But they are running out of places to park the planes at the moment.</p><p>The MAX has been grounded since March after two fatal crashes that claimed 346 lives. U.S. airlines have removed the MAX from their schedules until into next year. And in doing so, of course, the planes are now building up at various parking lots around the world.</p><p>If they don't get them moving soon, then Boeing will have to cut production or at least cease production of the 737, with all the ripple effects into the economy.</p><p>Ralph Nader wants to make sure that Boeing 737 doesn't fly again. He is a longtime consumer safety advocate, whose grandniece died in the 737 MAX crash in March. He joins me by phone from Washington.</p><p>[15:05:05]</p><p>QUEST: You, sir believe that there is something fundamentally wrong in the design of this plane, such that the reengineering of MCAS, this computer system, won't be sufficient to make it safe.</p><p>RALPH NADER, CONSUMER SAFETY ADVOCATE (via telephone): That's right. The reason why the software package is constantly being revised and refined after miscuing and killing 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia is the inherent, unstable design of larger engines put on the old fuselage of the 737 and doing it in a way that changes the center of gravity or the aerodynamic results.</p><p>And that increases the risk of stalling. It's a stalling problem that has to go back to the problem of the overloading by the big engines.</p><p>QUEST: Now, the regulators, of course say that the technology, MCAS, when it's being -- MCAS when it works properly will solve that situation. Are you worried, though, that what we've heard from Boeing, right away after these latest messages creates a lack of trust in their ability.</p><p>NADER: That's right. A software fix for a hardware defect is not the way to go in terms of Aerodynamic Engineering. And Boeing is misleading its investors -- its institutional investors. They're already being investigated by the Securities Exchange Commission with a too rosy view and saying that the planes will be undergrounded in the year, by the end of December is a fantasy.</p><p>They're in trouble on all fronts with their airlines. They're in trouble with the unions, they're in trouble with their own whistleblowers. More shoes are going to drop. More firings are going to occur. They just finally fired the head of their Commercial Aviation Business, Mr. McAllister.</p><p>The whole top crew of Boeing has to go. They have a vested interest in not admitting mistakes and they're jeopardizing the future of the Boeing Corporation itself. So Muilenburg and the Board of Directors need to be replaced.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but you'd agree that Boeing has been making planes safely for the best part of a century, therefore, what do you think went wrong?</p><p>NADER: Well, it used to be a very highly praised engineering firm and then when the McDonnell-Douglas merger occurred with Boeing, the McDonnell- Douglas mindset heavily shaped by commercial contracts with the Pentagon took over Boeing and changed an engineering company into an investment stock market hyped company with huge bonuses for the top brass and that led to increasingly controlling the F.A.A., which is underfunded and understaffed because of Congress and the White House under both parties over the years.</p><p>And so here we have this bizarre thing, Mr. Quest where you have this massive delegation of regulations to self-certification by Boeing itself. And there's no penalty. There are no fines by the F.A.A. The F.A.A. could impose fines, $400,000 per violation.</p><p>QUEST: When the regulators in the U.S. say it's safe to fly, and we know that other regulators for the first time pretty much in modern aviation, they're not -- the J.A.A., I.A.T.A. and the F.A.A. are not going on the same path. The Europeans are going to go later and Asia will go later and China will probably go later since.</p><p>But once all regulators globally say, yes, we are happy with this plane, then surely that's good enough.</p><p>NADER: It's not good enough unless they bring the planes back and dismantle the problems that caused it. They are prone to stalling and crashing in Indonesian the first place. This is a patchwork Band-Aid, fix -- this software and everybody is afraid in the industry because there are only two major manufacturers.</p><p>As you know, there's Airbus and Boeing. I know the Chinese, Brazilian, and Japanese are coming to compete shortly. But this is what happens when you just have two manufacturers. And the one in America controls the regulators and gives all kinds of campaign contributions to over 300 Members of Congress. But the hearings coming up may surprise you.</p><p>QUEST: Ralph Nader, good to have you, sir. We'll talk more about this as it progresses. I appreciate your time. The ongoing sector crisis with the 737 has made Boeing more reliant on its other models, and the trade war is hurting demand across the board.</p><p>Boeing is cutting production of the Dreamliner, the 787 and that's adding to concerns of the global economic slowdown and Caterpillar today reported a surprise drop in profits. Sales slumped in nearly every part of the world which might be China led, of course, it's crucially important, but it's clearly transmitting that weakness to other parts of the world.</p><p>Martin Wolf is with me, good to see you, Martin.</p><p>[15:10:17]</p><p>MARTIN WOLF, CHIEF ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, THE FINANCIAL TIMES: Good to see you.</p><p>QUEST: The Chief Economics Commentator at \"The Financial Times.\" This is the evidence -- the canary in the mine, if you wish -- Caterpillar, Boeing absent, its individual problems, the earnings that we are seeing. Companies are saying it's not just difficult, it is now troublesome.</p><p>WOLF: What we really have is a very significant slowdown in world manufacturing. And the companies you mentioned are all manufacturers, and that is clearly linked to the slowdown in China, which has transmitted itself in a very big way to Germany and so to Europe.</p><p>It is affecting major American manufacturers, you mentioned them and of course, the trade war is also playing a significant part in this story. Whether that -- well manufacturing is still quite a small part of the world economy -- whether that will transmit to the whole economy is the big question.</p><p>QUEST: But what is slowing us down? I mean, people sort of say, well, a bull market of over 10 years is just exhausted and tottering around on its last legs. It has to be more than that. Why is there this malaise in the world economy?</p><p>WOLF: I think there seem to be three major factors. One, I think the trade war itself, but not a huge one. Second, the rise in uncertainty which has affected investment, which is a huge driver of manufacturing demand. And finally, a real slow down in China, which is partly investment related, and partly due to the fact that the Chinese have decided they want to stop the credit boom, on which they used to depend. And these three things have come together in my view.</p><p>QUEST: This is pretty much the first time, the Chinese economy has been sufficiently large and systemically involved to be able to cause this sort of issue.</p><p>WOLF: It did the inverse in 2009, when it --</p><p>QUEST: Induced it.</p><p>WOLF: It really pulled our world economy out of the crisis with the staggering growth boosts that they managed immediately after the crisis. But yes, China is now the second largest national economy and unbelievably important imports, particularly for investment goods. So yes, it affects the world.</p><p>QUEST: And Brexit momentarily, if we may. The Armageddon scenario for the U.K. economy hasn't hit in the way that it was forecast, but the underlying rumblings are there, that the economy is suffering. You still believe there should be a second confirmatory referendum on the final whatever deal is put out there.</p><p>WOLF: Well, first of all, the economy is certainly smaller than it would otherwise have been. There's no real doubt -- there is a recent estimate perhaps 60 billion pounds a year smaller, which is a couple of percent -- two and a half percent?</p><p>Yes. I think the deal we are about to do, which is not clear, and we don't want to go into all the parliamentary shenanigans, I don't know what's going to happen. But if we do this deal, it is going to be immensely damaging.</p><p>QUEST: Why? What part of it because I've looked at the deal, which bit of it offends in your view?</p><p>WOLF: Well, the major one is very, very simple. At the best, and this is not clear, we will move from a complete integration in the European economy, single market, Customs Union, our most important trading partner, close to half our trade, a little bit under to a free trade agreement, which is worse probably than Canada's.</p><p>That's an immense shock for our trading goods. Our service sector with lose all the benefits of the single market. That's a huge part of what we do. The movement of our people in commercial services will be stopped. And of course, all the industries like cars, which have been completely integrated in the European economy, I expect in terms of their relation with Europe just to die.</p><p>So this is going to be a very substantial reduction in our trade with Europe, and it's likely to have knock on effects through investment demand and so forth.</p><p>Now, there are lots of estimates, but my estimate is that probable, a GDP - gross domestic product in 2013, might be between 50 and 70 percent. Smaller than -- the growth would be 50 to 70 percent smaller than it would otherwise be.</p><p>So instead of growing maybe 11 percent in GDP per head, we might grow only three to five percent of GDP per head. Yes, we will be better off, but that's a very big if.</p><p>QUEST: But you don't -- to those who say of course, well there are those new trade deals, the United States, Canada itself, Australia. I can see your --</p><p>[15:15:16]</p><p>WOLF: There are two problems here.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>WOLF: First, there's only one new trade deal that would really make a difference. That's the U.S. Because the US is a much smaller trading partner in the E.U., but it's close to a fifth. And the problem is that if we --</p><p>We can't, I think, do a trade deal with U.S. until we've done a trade deal with the E.U. because that will set a lot of the terms on which we can do the trade deal with the U.S. and there will be some crucial areas which the U.S. will be really interested, which will cut across what the E.U. will want because the regulatory requirements are so different. So I think they will be followed.</p><p>At the best, if you have the normal timetable for trade deals. Let's assume we reach a deal this year, it will probably take four years, five years, never mind the transition year to agree a deal with you. That's what it normally takes. And then we would do the trade deal with the U.S. and I think we might have sorted this all out by, I don't know 2025 to 2027.</p><p>And then -- but the other --</p><p>QUEST: Well, we'll still be around. We'll still be around.</p><p>WOLF: The others are trivial -- and Australia, these are all completely trivial. So the net effect over the next decade will unambiguously be, we will be worse off and that's what we're doing.</p><p>And I think the public should be told, this isn't what the Brexit has promised in the lead. Right? They said there will be a deal very much like what we have now. This is not what we're going to get. So I think the public should be asked is that really what you want?</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Really appreciate it. Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>WOLF: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Now, we'll hear more from Martin later in the program. Meanwhile, U.S. markets are trading flat. The Dow components, Boeing and Caterpillar posted disappointing earnings. Companies are warning the global slowdown and trade tensions are hitting profits. Investors are encouraged. We're down 34 points. It is fairly well talking about it.</p><p>Overall, the earnings are better than expected. Europe closed in a bit betwixt and between. Couldn't really decide what was happening. Small gains little losses overall. Investors remain cautious.</p><p>As we continue tonight, we will have more in a moment. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Libra -- we will be talking about the cryptocurrency extraordinaire, and why Facebook may not be the right people at the right time or indeed ever. In a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Mark Zuckerberg is on Capitol Hill. He is making his boldest pitch yet that Facebook should be allowed to launch a global cryptocurrency. Live pictures from Washington.</p><p>In testimony to the U.S. House of Representatives, he said if Washington blocked his Libra plan, then the U.S. risks falling behind countries like China and could lose its standing as the world's financial leader.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: I just think that we can't sit here and assume that because America is today the leader that it will always get to be the leader if we don't innovate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Innovate -- well, the prospect of a Facebook cryptocurrency has raised alarms. It could upend the global financial system, make the company even more powerful. Zuckerberg has been on the charm offensive hoping to change powerful minds.</p><p>Private meetings have been held with the Democrat, Maxine Waters, who chairs the Financial Services Committee in the U.S. She has drafted a bill titled Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.</p><p>In her opening remarks, she left no one in any doubt about what she thinks of Libra.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): Perhaps, you believe that you're above the law, and it appears that you are aggressively increasing the size of your company, and are willing to step on over anyone, including your competitors, women, people of color, your own users, and even our democracy to get what you want.</p><p>All of these problems I've outlined and given the company's size and reach, it should be clear why we have serious concerns about your plans to establish a global digital currency that would challenge the U.S. dollar.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Martin Wolf is with, Chief Economics Commentator at \"The Financial Times.\" You've been writing on this. What's wrong with Libra?</p><p>WOLF: Well, first of all, it's a very intriguing idea. He's gone about it I think in an incredibly unwise way. He put forward a proposal, which was very unclear in many important ways, which was bound to raise the hackles of regulators, central banks and governments and sort of put it -- and he has done this again, this sort of take it or leave it. If you don't accept what we do, the Chinese will take over. The Chinese are not going to have Libra, I can tell you that for free.</p><p>QUEST: What's wrong with Libra? From a monetary point of view? I'm not so much worried about drug trafficking or money laundering or all those sort of things, which I know are legitimate terms. But as an economics correspondent, tell me what you see as the economic reasons against it.</p><p>WOLF: Okay, so I think those reasons are important, very important. But I think they're essentially -- the essential point is, we don't know how Libra will be created. We don't know how it will be backed and because of that, we don't know at the moment, I think we can discuss some of the possibility -- we don't know how it will impact foreign currency markets and the payment system globally.</p><p>It could -- but I think this is a less important reason -- affect the values quite significantly the major currencies that it will hold if it gets big enough. I don't think that's a huge issue.</p><p>The bigger issue is that if it's used as a more convenient form of dollarization in developing countries, it would tend to destroy the domestic, the fiat currency of that country. It will undermine their ability to do monetary policy.</p><p>You could say that's a wonderful thing. It will allow their citizens the chance to have a better form of dollarization. But the governments of these countries, probably reasonably think, well we have a currency for a reason why should we let this American billionaire destroy it?</p><p>QUEST: Why is this different to say PayPal, Venmo in the United States; Monzo -- which are essentially, we all put money into them and then when we go to pay the bill, I Venmo to you and you Venmo to the restaurant and -- why is this hard?</p><p>WOLF: It is different because it's a new currency. And it's a new currency that is not pegged to another one. It's a floating currency which is essentially Facebook's currency. It's going to be backed they say, but it's a new currency.</p><p>The other -- the PayPal operates in Sterling or it operates in dollars, it operates -- it is just part of the payment system over monetary areas that exists. This is effectively a new monetary area, privately run. Now how that would work? We don't know, but it is something different.</p><p>QUEST: Isn't the reality, though, and this is the problem regulators have and monetary authorities, this is going to arrive someday in some form. So -- and I know you were at the IMF last week, you know, this this idea of which legitimate Central Bank, collectively or individually is going to come up with their own version of crypto?</p><p>WOLF: Well, there are two questions there. One, Central Banks will issue their own digital currency.</p><p>But I think that something like Facebook could operate as a currency without regulators agreeing that it should be allowed to exist. It will need authorization of some form. How that authorization will work and there might be conflicts among regulators on this, the Swiss are the keenest, that's where it seems to be established. So maybe they'll operate in Switzerland.</p><p>[15:25:25]</p><p>WOLF: But I think that it will not be as easy for Facebook to upend the monetary system as it's done everything else. Just being a very large and powerful company will not be enough.</p><p>QUEST: Doesn't it excite you?</p><p>WOLF: Well, there's one aspect if it does, which is very important that it could facilitate cross border payments, massively; make the border payment system much more efficient, and that will be a huge benefit to poor people.</p><p>So in principle, there's a very good idea here. The question is before principle, it is not enough, like the Boeing 737 you were talking about. You want to know it's going to fly.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>WOLF: Pleasure.</p><p>QUEST: As we continue, from Chile to Lebanon, mass protests are spreading across the globe. The cause that connects them all, inequality and the distribution of fairness. In a moment.</p><p>QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest. A lot more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in just a moment. Look at how rampant inequality could destabilize economies around the world, including in the U.S. Netflix wants to crack down on password sharing. Millions of users could be affected.</p><p>As we continue, this is CNN and on this network, the facts always come first.</p><p>British Police are investigating the deaths of 39 people discovered in a truck container outside of London. Some politicians are speculating the case could be linked to human trafficking.</p><p>The driver from Northern Ireland has been arrested on suspicion of murder. A local official is describing him as a 25-year-old, a man called Morris Robinson.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Called Morris Robinson. The quest includes communications between the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Donald Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The motion was filed by the ethics watchdog group American Oversight under the Freedom of Information Act.</p><p>Chilean authorities say the death toll in the week of unrest now stands at 18. One of the victims has a 4-year-old child who was run over when a vehicle rammed into the protesters. The president has announced a new social and economic agenda aimed at quelling the unrest. Pope Francis is calling for a dialogue to end the violence.</p><p>And in Lebanon, protesters outraged by the economic crisis are once again on the streets. It's the seventh day in a row. The protests have paralyzed Beirut and other major cities in the country. They've blocked roads and they've shut down the banking system and the schools. Reform package announced by the Prime Minister Saad Hariri has failed to calm the anger.</p><p>And in Bolivia, there's also tensions over suspected electoral fraud. Protesters in the opposition are accusing the authorities of rigging the vote-count in favor of incumbent President Evo Morales. Bolivia's Foreign Affairs Minister has requested an audit.</p><p>So, as I was just describing to you, unrest around the globe is growing. The protesters are battling different causes in the various countries. For instance, in Lebanon, the touch paper, the blue touch paper was a tax on WhatsApp calls that sent everybody into the streets, the tax was rescinded. In Chile, it was an increase in subway fares.</p><p>In Ecuador, a decrease in fuel subsidies. But if you look for the common thread, the longer-term anger over political and economic inequality. And that gap is growing. It's a growing problem in the United States for instance where a new study finds that for the first time in history, U.S. billionaires are paying a lower tax rate than members of the working class.</p><p>And the 400 richest families have more wealth than the bottom 60 percent of households. It's all to do with President Trump's corporate tax cuts in 2017. One of the authors of this new report, Gabriel Zucman is an economics professor at UC Berkeley. It's called the \"Triumph of Injustice\". He joins me from New York.</p><p>I apologize that I'm not able to be in New York with you. Blame Brexit. Sir, just how bad is the situation and how quickly is it getting worse?</p><p>GABRIEL ZUCMAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, UC BERKELEY: Yes, thanks, Richard for having me. You know, income and wealth inequality has increased a lot in the U.S. The top 1 percent used to earn 10 percent of national income in 1980. And today earns about 20 percent of U.S. national income. And at the same time, the tax system has become a much less progressive.</p><p>The tax rates of the very rich have collapsed. The situation today in 2018 is that when you take into account all taxes paid at all levels of government, everybody pays around 28 percent, every income group pays around 28 percent of their income in taxes, except the ultra wealthy. Billionaires, the top 400 richest Americans who pay less than every other income group. They --</p><p>QUEST: But --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Pay 23 percent.</p><p>QUEST: They do that because they are able to employ a multitude of shell companies, trusts, write-offs, everything -- I mean, you know, the president himself has been one of the biggest offenders, according to the research from the \"New York Times\". But what they do, it might be immoral, but it's legitimate.</p><p>ZUCMAN: Well, you know the frontier between what's legal avoidance and illegal tax evasion is pretty thin. You know, generally, if you're doing something with the sole purpose of avoiding taxes, there's a provision in the U.S. tax law like you know, tax law of other countries that says that's illegal. You know, transactions need to have economic substance, and what we're seeing these days is lots of transactions that don't have economic --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Substance.</p><p>QUEST: Well --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Like multinational companies who create corporations in Bermuda where nothing happens, that could be qualified as tax evasion.</p><p>QUEST: But when it comes to raising tax revenues, you know, sir, that you make most of your money in the middle bit. I mean, I remember -- I'm old enough to remember the U.K. which had a top rate of tax if you added on investor surcharge of 98 percent. But the truth is, most -- and indeed the treasury, when the U.K. lowered the tax rate from 50 back to 45 percent, pointed out, you didn't actually raise that much money at the higher levels.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>ZUCMAN: Well it depends. You know, it depends if governments tolerate tax avoidance or tax evasion. You know, if you have this big industry that helps the wealthy dodge taxes, and if you have loopholes in the law, then yes, you're not going to collect a ton of money by increasing tax rates. But these things change over time, you know, look at the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. used to have a very progressive income tax system where the wealthy paid 55 percent, 60 percent of their income in taxes in the 19 -- no, in the middle of the 20th century.</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Because the social norms were different. No, avoidance, evasion were not tolerated at the time.</p><p>QUEST: Gabriel, do you fear we will see more evidence of inequality spilling out into protest? The sort of which we've only really had a taste of.</p><p>ZUCMAN: Yes, that's the main risk. You know, if globalization means ever lower taxes for its main winners, multi-national companies and their shareholders, and ever higher taxes for those who don't benefit a lot from it, then it's not sustainable. We're going to see more and more social unrest. And that's why if we want to make globalization and democracy more sustainable, we need to fix tax injustice.</p><p>We need to make sure that those who benefit the most from economic growth, instead of seeing their taxes --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Fall, pay more in taxes.</p><p>QUEST: I'm just curious. What do you think -- and I -- this is -- this is a classic how long is a piece of string question. What do you think is the right tax rate for a billionaire?</p><p>ZUCMAN: Well, it's not for economists to say. You know, we developed a website, taxjusticenow.org where people can simulate their own tax reform and make up their own mind. You know, it's for the public to decide through democratic deliberation and the vote, what should be the right tax rate?</p><p>Where economists like me can help if there's a demand for her distribution and for a more progressive taxation, we can make sure that taxes work. We can fix the leaks in the tax system and help you know, improve the tax system --</p><p>QUEST: Good, very glad to have you with us, sir, I appreciate it, we'll follow up and we'll talk again in the future, please come back --</p><p>ZUCMAN: Thank you so much --</p><p>QUEST: Again on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Now, Google has hit light speed, IBM says not so fast. Quantum computing is at the center of a big tech tiff. Who actually has actually done quantum whatever it is. And does it matter even if they haven't? In a moment.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>QUEST: Google says its new quantum computer has the fastest processing speed in existence. And this machine needs only 200 seconds to solve a problem that takes the world's fastest computer 10,000 years. Here's how it works. Are you ready for this? Yes, come on. Regular computers use 1 and 0, as well, we all like that score, 1 and 0, switching on, switching off. Google uses quantum bits or qubits. It allows any combination of numbers simultaneously.</p><p>Google CEO says the breakthrough has made the impossible possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, GOOGLE: For many years, practical quantum computing was only theoretically possible. Google's team has proven it can work. This is the halo world moment for quantum computing that many of us have been waiting for.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: IBM says not so fast, Google. A regular computer would need only two and a half days to solve the problem. The former \"National\" editor-at- large Lance Ulanoff joins me from New York. All right, let's both admit to being in deep water here. At least, I am on the whole issue of quantum computing. But what was this thing that Google got the computer to do that would have taken everything else so long?</p><p>LANCE ULANOFF, SOCIAL MEDIA &amp; TECH EXPERT: I mean, it's just -- it's a kind of -- it's a processing task. I mean, they didn't really go into tremendous detail on exactly what the processing task is. It's just the kind of task that gets exponentially larger very quickly. And that a so- called large-room computer or super computer that IBM has, they said would take 10,000 years to compute and they took 200 seconds.</p><p>Now, of course, that's why IBM is saying hold on, our regular giant room computer can now do it in two and a half days. But it's all about -- you know, this is not so much what problem did it solve, this is proof of concept because the idea is that when we finally get quantum computing in our hands, you're working on these big problems, it's going to change things in a very --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ULANOFF: Significant way because it can solve problems that you can't do with these regular super computers.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but IBM, big, blue of old. Super computers, extraordinaire, I mean, they must be seething at the idea that this upstart called Google could beat them at something like this.</p><p>ULANOFF: They're in a race. Look, you know, IBM has worked out quantum computing as well. You know, it's not just the number of qubits, because I think Google has 53 qubits. But it's also, you know, keeping temperatures down. I mean, these systems work at a whole different level. I've actually --I mean, I've seen an IBM quantum computing, it looks like nothing I've ever seen in my life.</p><p>So, you know, they work out just as hard, they just don't like that Google is kind of going out there and stealing their thunder and saying -- you know, and also the way they set it. You know, they said quantum supremacy. Which I think people took to mean that Google had achieved quantum supremacy.</p><p>That's not actually what I think they were trying to say though. They were trying to say, quantum computing is supreme over standard supercomputing. But in any case, you know, it's fun just to watch them, you know, battle it out because in the end, we're going to be the benefactors because quantum computing is a whole new way of computing.</p><p>QUEST: How will it change our lives? I mean, Google obviously wanted bragging rights and Google's spat with IBM and you can throw in Cisco and everybody else who might someday get involved. But come on, how is it going to change you and me getting up in the morning and brushing our teeth?</p><p>ULANOFF: All right, well, you know, they're going to apply to things like machine-learning and chemistry. So, let's just say chemistry for a moment and think about, you know, the big problems behind biology and chemistry, cancer treatment. You know, working out real problems that are affecting real people where at some point.</p><p>Because as you're trying to run through permutations or you're trying to figure things out with really difficult problems, it can take a long time or maybe you reach a limit even with the best computers, and quantum computing is going to go beyond --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>ULANOFF: That. And I know people get excited when we talk about this is not about laptops, this is not about your phone. This is about big computers solving big problems at least in, you know, maybe a decade from now.</p><p>QUEST: All right, that's it. That was going to be my last question. So, finally, I guess for IBM this morning, it was a bit like, you know, when the U.S. woke up and found Russia had put Sputnik into --</p><p>ULANOFF: That's right --</p><p>QUEST: Orbit. You know, Houston, we got a problem, and the problem is --</p><p>ULANOFF: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: They just did it first.</p><p>ULANOFF: Yes, IBM was very quick to say hold on a moment, not 10,000 years, two and a half days. And I'm sure that they'll follow with their own quantum announcement very shortly.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>QUEST: Good to see Lance, as always, I appreciate it, thank you --</p><p>ULANOFF: Good talking to you --</p><p>QUEST: Now, the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday has sued the state of California after it signed an agreement with Canada to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Drax power station in Yorkshire, England has been combating its own emissions for many years.</p><p>It proves the way forward arguably. Formerly, the biggest polluter in western Europe. Drax says the plant now generates 15 percent of U.K.'s renewable energy. CNN's John Defterios in more in the latest installment of the \"GLOBAL ENERGY CHALLENGE\".</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: The biggest power plant in the U.K., Drax was built nearly a half-century ago to burn coal, looming large over the North Yorkshire landscape, change is in the air.</p><p>WILL GARDINER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DRAX GROUP: We've actually reduced our emissions, I think quite fair to say more than any other utility in the world. And not by selling things, et cetera, but by really transforming the way that we actually generate power.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Once the biggest polluter in western Europe, Drax has converted four of its six coal-generating units to biomass, and now produces 94 percent renewable electricity. Biomass describes plant and agricultural matter that generates energy from the wood humans have burned for millennia to modern reinventions like Drax compressed sawdust pellets.</p><p>GARDINER: What we wanted to do was actually conserve the assets, the jobs and the livelihoods of the people here by moving away from coal to something else. And so biomass was a very sort of effective way to do that.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: While biomass has helped keep the lights on as the U.K. moves away from coal, the claim that burning biomass is carbon-neutral is a divisive issue in the scientific community.</p><p>RAPHAEL SLADE, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW, IMPERIAL COLLEGE, LONDON: Whether the biomass is a fuel is carbon neutral, carbon-beneficial or not really depends on the time scale in which you look at it.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Time is the critical factor. Even if trees are replanted, some scientists estimate it can take a century for the carbon dioxide to be re- absorbed into the atmosphere. Technology will be key to guarantee the place of renewable biomass in a low-carbon economy.</p><p>Drax says helping pioneer a system to capture the carbon that the biomass emits on an industrial scale.</p><p>GARDINER: What we're doing here is we're capturing one ton of CO2 a day. And just to give you a sense of scale, this pipe is carrying enough blue gas to capture one ton of CO2 per day. This very big pipe is carrying the flue gas from one biomass unit. If we captured all the CO2 from that gas, it would be 10,000 tons of CO2 a day or as much as 4 million tons of CO2 per year.</p><p>And that's really what we were hoping to do by the middle of the 20s or maybe the late 20s to have one biomass unit up and running with carbon capture and storage.</p><p>SLADE: The technology works, but scaling it up and rolling it out and financing it are going to be really significant challenges.</p><p>GARDINER: Biomass looks set to be part of the transition away from fossil fuels. But until we can make biomass with carbon capture sustainable at scale, it's hard to see the wood for the trees. John Defterios, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: Right, simple question. Do you use, beg, steal, borrow, glom off somebody else's Netflix account, Spotify, streaming, newspapers? In other words, are you freeloading? There at cnn.com-slash-join because after the break, we'll talk about Netflix that wants to stop people like you from borrowing and using your parents' Netflix account. After the break.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>QUEST: Netflix wants to know exactly who is watching their streaming service. The company says it's considering limiting how users share their passwords, nothing official yet, but this mere suggestion has sent panic and fear through most of my producers, most of whom are still using their parents' accounts.</p><p>Netflix executives said they're looking for customer-friendly ways to crack down on account sharing. Are you going to admit publicly, never mind Netflix. Any account, any streaming, Spotify, newspaper, magazine, where you pay or somebody else pays and you log on at cnn.com-slash-join. I don't -- I think we've got a load of honest people -- or I don't know, 55 percent of you say you do not share passwords.</p><p>Brian Stelter is with me in New York. Brian, why is Netflix doing this?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: I think Netflix is paying very close attention to this because it's getting a little bit harder for Netflix to grow -- actually it's getting a lot harder for Netflix to grow in the United States because it is so tapped out and it's getting harder to grow around the world as well. And so, it makes sense for Netflix to pay attention to this issue.</p><p>It is notable, Richard, the reaction to the mere suggestion that Netflix is going to think about doing something. You know, there's you know, the comment on the recent earnings call was we continue to monitor it. We're looking at the situation, we've got no big plans to announce in terms of doing something differently.</p><p>But just the notion that they're thinking about it did cause a ruckus. And I can understand why. It actually speaks to the power and the prominence of Netflix that this matters so much to people.</p><p>QUEST: But it's not just Netflix. I mean --</p><p>STELTER: That's true --</p><p>QUEST: I share somebody's -- I share somebody's Spotify. I know at least a few people who have -- might have used my ft.com account.</p><p>STELTER: I was going to say --</p><p>QUEST: In the past, in the past --</p><p>STELTER: Give it up for newspapers -- my mom just e-mailed me two days ago asking me for my \"Washington Post\" log-in. Now, some of these sites do have family-sharing options. So there's some level of that it's OK to be sharing. But I think the reality is when you're --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: Giving away your Netflix password or your ft password to a dozen people, then you are starting to get into a situation where those companies could be making more money than they are -- and I'm surprised we only have 53 percent of people saying yes, they share accounts, I suspect everybody has done it once or twice.</p><p>QUEST: Well, I suspect they're still doing it, and certainly even the QUEST MEANS BUSINESS office is anything to go by. Streaming -- the various streaming services are now virtually ready to launch --</p><p>STELTER: Right --</p><p>QUEST: \"HBO\" is there, \"Disney\" is there, everybody is there. I mean, who knows what \"Verizon\" and all those are going to do. I mean, they seem to have got lost somewhere down the road. Who do you like the look of the most in terms of --</p><p>STELTER: Well, it's a --</p><p>QUEST: As a business model?</p><p>STELTER: I was speaking with Netflix executives in Hollywood yesterday, they feel like it's kind of a late arrivals. So these other companies --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: Are finally joining the party. In fact, Ted Sarandos just mentioned that on stage at an event today, you know, where he said, you know, he was surprised that it's taken this long for other companies to create serious challenging streaming --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>STELTER: Rivals. I think it's a situation where the pie is so big, there's plenty for everybody. People are addicted to their phones and their tablets --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>STELTER: And we watch five hours of TV a day, that means there's going to be a lot of winners in this race.</p><p>QUEST: Brian, you've been moonlighting. You haven't admitted this, but you have been moonlighting, I did not realize that you spent your spare time as the Defense Secretary of the United Kingdom. Look at the picture, you clearly, I saw you in the House of Commons yesterday answering defense --</p><p>STELTER: I've never seen that picture --</p><p>QUEST: Questions.</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>STELTER: But wow --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: I think he has better fashion sense than me though. I need to get that jacket. It's a good-looking jacket.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, you're even wearing the same tie. I mean, this is -- this is -- this is by the way -- for viewers who are worried. This is Ben Wallace who I saw yesterday --</p><p>STELTER: Turn this way --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>STELTER: Should I go that way --</p><p>QUEST: Maybe you'd like to answer questions in the House of Commons. Good to see you, Brian, thank you --</p><p>STELTER: Oh, yes!</p><p>QUEST: Great to see you, thank you. Last few minutes of trade on Wall Street. Have a quick look at how things are going. The market is set to close pretty flat. Join me over at the wall and I'll show you exactly what I've got, 24 points, well, you know, we were down about 30 points. So, now we're up 24 points, that really tells you small trades are moving this market.</p><p>It's hard to get excited about a market that is -- if you look at the Dow 30, and you realize what's happening with economic bellwethers like Boeing and Caterpillar. All of whom posted disappointing earnings. Nike is at the bottom, down 3.4 percent after it announced the CEO Mark Parker will step down and will be replaced.</p><p>Merck is at the top, but not by very much. The market is doing very little. Profitable moment after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's profitable moment. Facebook really has set the cats amongst the pigeons with its cryptocurrency Libra. You heard the arguments and they do call -- basically fall down to either one of worrying about money laundering, drug trafficking, money being transferred through Libra for illicit purposes, all of which is a pretty serious stuff.</p><p>And then you have the issue of monetary, the ability as Martin Wolf beautifully explained tonight, the ability of some governments and smaller countries to operate a monetary policy when most of their public are using Libra to exchange, and that in itself can create economic activity that could lead to inflation. It could lead to an inability to control interest rates.</p><p>That's why Libra is so dangerous. This is not dangerous -- maybe this is so worrying. It's not that it is bad in and of itself. Somebody somewhere is going to do a cryptocurrency. But unlike Venmo, unlike PayPal, this is an independent currency. It's not merely a payment mechanism. And no wonder of course, the regulators are going to be so hard.</p><p>They're not clamping down because they're being mean, they're clamping down because there's a real risk that this could get out of control. And that's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for tonight, I am Richard Quest in London. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, I hope it is profitable. I will be back in New York tomorrow.</p><p>(BELL RINGING)</p><p>BlackBerry, good, there they are, still on the move.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019102301cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBK-HGS1-JB20-G2XP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF STATE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Ahead to sell the first big legal test for Robert Mueller and his Russia investigation. The trial is former Chairman of the Trump campaign now underway and the outcome could be either prison or pardon for Paul Manafort. Plus, fool me once shame on you but fool me twice? Thousands of Americans may have been suckered again by Russian hackers planting fake stories on social media to influence the outcome of Congressional Elections later this year. And a judge blocks a how-to guide of making a gun at home with a 3d printer. How the Trump Administration cleared the way for unchecked, untraceable, undetectable firearms. Hello and thanks for joining us everybody, I'm John Vause and you're watching NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prosecutors have painted a picture of the former Trump Campaign Chairman Paul Manafort living an extravagant lifestyle, willing to lie and dodge taxes to keep it. He spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on designer clothes and custom-made suits, $15,000 on an ostrich jacket, seven homes, and more than 30 bank accounts. That was just the opening day of his trial in Alexandria, Virginia. CNN's Jessica Schneider reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Tonight, prosecutors are off to a fiery start in their case against Paul Manafort calling him a shrewd liar who orchestrated a global scheme to avoid paying taxes on millions of dollars. Lawyers for the special counsel told the jury Manafort earned millions in secret income from the \"cash spigot\" that came from working for the \"golden goose in Ukraine former pro-Putin President Viktor Yanukovych.\" But Manafort's lawyers pushed back blaming it on the Russian oligarchs who Manafort worked for saying they required him to pay through secret bank accounts. As the defense team entered the courthouse earlier in the day they remained resolute.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm feeling good.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Good. Any chance he may decide to flip and cooperate? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No chance.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Paul Manafort faced the six men and six women jury who will decide whether he could spend the rest of his life in prison. The President's former Campaign Chairman appeared come wearing a dark suit as lawyers made their opening statements and the prosecution called its first witness. Paul Manafort was the first indictment secured by the special counsel's team last October. His former co- defendant and deputy Rick Gates has already pleaded guilty and is cooperating. And in a bold move, Manafort's team told the jury his defense will revolve around discrediting Gates who is expected to be called as one of the government's 35 witnesses.</p><p>Defense Attorney Thomas Zehnle claimed it was Gates who stole money and lied and embezzled millions for Manafort. Zehnle said it was Gates who \"had his hand in the cookie jar.\" This trial is a key test for Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Judge T.S. Ellis has banned any mention of President Trump, Russia, or collusion from the courtroom but the case still looms over the White House since the charges against Manafort stem from the special counsel's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. The White House now trying to downplay the trial and Manafort's role on the Trump campaign even though Manafort was the campaign chairman for three months.</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: This trial obviously centers on matters that have nothing to do with the campaign. I think that even Mr. Manafort as I read it had requested that there be no mention of his brief tenure at the Trump campaign several years ago. This has nothing to do with collusion, Russia, nothing to do with the Trump campaign.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Manafort's Virginia case centers around his past lobbying work for the pro-Putin Ukrainian government for which prosecutors say he received $16 million. The Government alleges Manafort hid millions and failed to pay taxes while still spending the money on real estate and luxury purchases including homes in Manhattan, Virginia, and the Hamptons, expensive suits, and baseball tickets. And prosecutors will present hundreds of e-mails, photos, and financial records to prove it. In opening statements, the Government even promised evidence of a $15,000 made from an ostrich. Prosecutors say Manafort also lied to banks about his income to secure more than $20 million in loans. The President has repeatedly tried to downplay Manafort's ties to the campaign even though he proved a key player as president Trump seized the nomination.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Manafort has nothing to do with our campaign but I feel so -- I tell you, I feel a little badly about it. They went back 12 years to get things that he did 12 years ago. You know, Paul Manafort worked for me for a very short period of time. He worked for many other Republicans, George. You were telling me what, 49 days or something, a very short period of time.</p><p>SCHNEIDER: This trial expected to last three weeks and it isn't the only trial that Paul Manafort faces. He's charged with seven counts in federal court in Washington D.C. That trial is set to start in September. And until then it looks like Manafort will remain behind bars. That's because the D.C. appeals court just projected his request to overturn the lower court's decision that sent him to jail for alleged witness tampering until his trial. Jessica Schneider, CNN Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:05:26] VAUSE: Joining me here in Los Angeles Ron Brownstein, CNN Senior Political Analyst and Senior Editor for The Atlantic. Hey Ron, it's good to have you back. It's a trial it seems -- you know, it's the two things going on here. It has nothing and everything at the same time to do with Russia collusion and election interference. Even the prosecutors have agreed there'll be no mention of Russia and collusion that is hanging over this trial like a looming dark cloud.</p><p>RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: With Manafort's background, you know, that many people have thought that if there are questions of collusion, ultimately he would be in the middle of them. And yet as you say, this is a case about behavior that occurred before the campaign. I think that whatever else happens in this trial, whether they mentioned the words collusion or Russia or not, there -- I think there's a little bit of shock and awe for the Trump defense team and the White House and that it is going to give us a sense of the forensic accounting capacity of the of the Mueller investigatory team. I mean, even as what they let out today, they have the capacity to untangle a lot of complex intricate -- interconnected financial transactions and there are many people believe that one strain or one strain of a line of the inquiry for the Mueller investigation are the tangled potential Trump financial connections including potentially some to Russia.</p><p>VAUSE: So they went back and Manafort previously was paid millions of dollars sources pro-Putin parties in Ukraine. He went on business deals with you Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He was in contact with Russians known to U.S. intelligence during the campaign. Given everything that we know now that doesn't look too good not just for Manafort but for the President as well.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Right, I mean, look, there's -- as we says we're just saying, I mean, there's a lot he can possibly tell. But so far there's no indication that he will. You made the point in the last hour that not only he be worried about Trump, he may be worried about people who paid him -- the people who paid him. And so he may have incentives not to tell his stories. But the -- where he is now in terms of his calculation, they look very different when he gets through this trial.</p><p>VAUSE: It's three weeks long so by the end of three weeks.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Yes, and were potentially facing a very long time in jail. As I recall in Watergate, it was only after Judge Sirica sentenced the Watergate conspirators that they -- that they began to crack.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. So you can do a deal at any point I guess to flip. Ron, here's some reporting though from CNN's Dana Bash. President Trump is telling aides that he wants to considerably step up the number of rallies he is doing. His team is looking at ways to do just that. He is annoyed as always at the Mueller probe and concerned that it is fueling ways for his opponents to chip away at his legitimacy as President. The President is concerned about the outcome of the midterms. He is nervous that Democrats are going to take the House and that he will lose the ability to get his agenda through. Those could appear at the poll last week which indicate the President at least is losing some support especially after that summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki. Overall 38 percent approve of his job, down five points. Among Republicans support remains high 82 percent, Democrat seven percent, I wonder who they are. This is just such an incredible catch.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Well, look, I mean, this is fascinating because you know, normally if you had a president who was somewhere around 40 percent in approval, the party would want him to receive, to kind of step back because when the president's approval rating has been under 50 percent in midterm election, his party has suffered significant losses but what the comments from the President that Dana is reporting there, I think are consistent with what -- with what we are seeing. There is a strategy on the part of the White House. It is a somewhat counterintuitive strategy but it is a strategy. And they believe that the way to avoid the usual midterm losses is to turn -- is to mobilize their base deplorable plus as Bannon called it in something today by pursuing polarizing issues and also by precipitating a series of endless series of kind of cultural fights on Twitter and elsewhere.</p><p>The risk they are taking -- and there are places where that may be valuable with Republicans who are endangered in districts that were strongly Trump or the Democrats who are trying to hold in some of those red state Senate seats that strongly voted for Trump. The problem is that in the House, the places that will tip the balance, that are the epicenter of the struggle for control of the House are placed is by and large where more people disapprove than approve of President Trump. They tilt not entirely but they tilt toward white- collar suburbs where he conspicuously underperforms a typical Republican. And what he is doing is polarizing the electorate in a way that makes life harder not easier for those remaining Republicans trying to cling to seats in the blue metros around the country many of which voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p><p>VAUSE: Because -- as well as states that where Trump is playing our biggest Florida, he'd been campaigning for one of the candidates there. He was in Florida a few hours ago. He wrote on his greatest hits both real and imagined and then he also went on to boast about his trade policies. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[01:10:15] TRUMP: In the past, politicians ran for office pledging to crack down on unfair trade. They never did anything about it. Only to get elected and they just didn't do anything. The United States was allowed to truly get ripped off but we're not going to let that happen. I'm not like other politicians. You've seen what happens, I've kept my promises. (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And part of that idea, the trade policy is tariffs which he slept on goods from China. CNN is reporting the Trump Administration plans to raise pending tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese goods to 25 percent from ten percent. All this idea, this trade war, this protectionism, it's raising the anger of the Koch Brothers, the industrialists conservatives, they had this sort of -- they talked with Trump. They're all into their corners that it'll be nice that is now over. The Koch Brothers actually out there criticizing Donald Trump. He is not taking that lightly. He said this in a tweet, \"the globalist Koch Brothers have become total joke in real Republican circles against strong borders and powerful trade. I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas. They love my tax and regulation cuts, judicial picks, and workers, and on and on.\"</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: That actually, you know, that's a very revealing tweet because basically the trade the Trump has offered to the existing Republican Party is look, because of my appeal, because of this ethnic -- ethno nationalist argument, the kind of defensive nationalism that I put forward, I am able to win the White House and thus achieve the unified control of government that is getting you your tax cuts, your regulatory cut, your judges court, and therefore, therefore you kind of bite your lip, shut up and take what I am giving you on immigration and trade and trashing of NATO and threatening alliances all of which strain the Republican you know, traditional Republicans thing. That -- he's making explicit there but in many ways has been implicit.</p><p>And it is strike of all the things that Donald Trump has done, separating children from their parents of the boarders, the comments about Charlottesville, the press conference with Putin, the strained relations with so many allies, nothing has caused more tension in the Republican coalition than his position country. Nothing is called more overt resistance and it is -- it's fascinating because what we're just talking about the real risk that Republicans face in white-collar suburbs where you have well-educated, predominantly white voters who are pulling back from the Republican Party because their views about Trump partly on policy, but largely on personality. Rural America is their absolute firewall in November and that -- and many of the farm groups are among those the most exercised about what he's doing on trade.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, they're being incredibly worried about tariffs and the impact it's going to have. But is it wise to take on the Koch Brothers? These are billionaire guys and they like to spend money. I mean, can't even a war with the K0ch Brothers?</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Well, will they go to war? I mean, that -- all --</p><p>VAUSE: Only because he's out that it's building today.</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: All of these Republican interests have basically so far more than not gone along with this basic deal. They may grumble about Trump's behavior, they may view his racial provocation is too close as a flame, too hot for them to stand near. They may grumble about what he's doing on immigration and trade but in essence, they are saying we are -- we are still going to support a Republican control of Congress, a Republican Congress that is enabling rather than constraining you because we want the other side of it.</p><p>What is the breaking point? The breaking point likely would be significant losses, particularly in these white-collar suburbs in the 2018 election. But even that, you know, this thing is shambling along and holding together you have kind of white collar Republicans who are uneasy about the cultural side, you have blue-collar Republicans who may view the economic agenda is overly plutocratic. But both sides need to be getting enough to hold together. The price though is this intense mobilization of the other side. All the Americans are kind of horrified by both ends of that and his action.</p><p>VAUSE: And of course, all the ongoing damage which is saying to this country --</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Well, that is --</p><p>VAUSE: Will have -- will suffer from -- for years to come. Ron, we didn't get up to the fact that Trump is taking credit for department stores saying Merry Christmas once more. That was at the rally, interesting given that --</p><p>BROWNSTEIN: Christmas in July, they had -- the Phillies game the other day. I don't know why he took credit for that.</p><p>VAUSE: I'm sure he did. Ron, thank you. Well just months before Americans vote in Congressional Elections Facebook has uncovered what is believed to be a new coordinated effort to spread disinformation. The social media giant has shut down dozens of fake accounts and pages which may have ties to Russian trolls. Details now from CNN's Drew Griffin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[01:14:50] DREW GRIFFIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Facebook calls it in authentic behavior and though Facebook can't be sure, it sure looks like Russia again. 32 pages with names including Black Elevation, Resistors, as Aztlan Warriors being followed by 290,000 accounts. The fake accounts also setting up and promoting real events and protests aimed at further polarizing U.S. political discourse.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody in.</p><p>CROWD: Everybody in.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody out.</p><p>AMERICAN CROWD: No, we're not.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Many of the events did occur, including this one last year in New York City attended by actual Americans who likely had no idea that the Resisters' Facebook page was probably run by Russians.</p><p>Another event by the same group was supposed to take place in a couple of weeks. Resistors set up a counter-protest against white supremacists at the White House, August 10. Five other real groups signed on to participate.</p><p>As Facebook was announcing its crackdown on these potential Russian sites, the U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security was at a Cybersecurity Conference saying there's no doubt, Russia meddled in the 2016 election.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Everyone and everything is now a target.</p><p>GRIFFIN: And Russian actors may be added again. Comparing the upcoming midterm elections to a looming storm.</p><p>NIELSEN: Today, I believe the next major attack is more likely to reach us online than on an airplane. We are in a crisis mode. A Cat 5 hurricane has been forecast, and now we must prepare.</p><p>GRIFFIN: Facebook says, these current pages all shut down. Have the hallmarks of the activities the Russians did around the presidential election. Though there are some differences this time the pages didn't lead back to Russian I.P. addresses, and they used third-party services to buy ads to boost their posts and encourage people to follow the pages.</p><p>As part of its new transparency policy, not only is Facebook announcing this publicly that it's shut down these 32 suspected Russian sites. It is going to contact all 290 thousand accounts that were in contact with these sites to let them know these were obviously fake Facebook accounts. Drew Griffin, CNN, Atlanta.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Joining me now, from Tucson, Arizona, CNN national security analyst and retired CIA chief of Russia operations, Steve Hall. Thanks for being with us, Steve.</p><p>I guess, if nothing else, I guess the Russians should get credit for the sheer audacity and persistence despite all the outrage and the world's attention. They just keep on doing what they've been doing. I guess what, because there's no incentive to stop.</p><p>STEVEN HALL, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (via skype): Well, it works very well for them, the last time, John. And in addition to -- you know, audacity and just -- you know, trying to get it again, they've obviously learned a bit, as well or decided to employ a bit more tradecraft than they did last time.</p><p>Making it harder to trace back to the IP addresses, those technical addresses that they use or they can be used to find out where they're coming from. Using what we've referred to as cutouts third parties to actually -- you know, purchase internet connections for them, trying to cover their tracks a little bit better this time.</p><p>But yes, being as it worked so well at last time, I think they'll probably go for it again in the midterm elections here in the United States.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, there was some pretty basic stuff in those tweaks they've made like paying for everything not in rubles, but in U.S. and Canadian dollars that seems like a no-brainer. We should say the Russians have me directly linked to these what 30-32 pages which were pulled.</p><p>But language patterns indicate non-English speakers, the tactics, the contents, all similar to Russian troll farm which operated what between 2014 and 2017. So, if it looks like an axillary brown bear, growls like an axillary brown bear, bites like one, then, chances are comrade, it's a bear, right?</p><p>HALL: Yes, and again you have to ask -- you know, who would have the most interest in doing this or might -- there might be someone off, so, you know, sort of copycats that you sometimes get in other types of criminal activity.</p><p>But yes, this is -- this is clearly the Russian government doing what it -- what it does best. And to be clear, you know, this is not a Vladimir Putin, of course, who's the intellectual author of these things. He's not a Republican and he is not a Democrat, and he's clearly anti-American.</p><p>So, you know, this is it's not surprising to see that you -- that the -- that the attacks are really across the political spectrum. The goal here is anti-American. The goal is not anti any particular candidate or any particular race.</p><p>It's to try to create discord and confusion and create some sort of moral equivalency between -- you know, the way Vladimir Putin runs his country and the way the United States and other Western countries are run in a democratic fashion.</p><p>VAUSE: And one of the details here is that these guys read about 150 ads, and the price tag on that was $11,000. Attacking democracy seems pretty cheap these days.</p><p>HALL: Oh, yeah, that's chump change. And the resources that the Russians will throw at this is truly amazing. Yes, this is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what we've been able to see from Facebook. There is other social media platforms and there's other ways to go about this. It's not just through social media.</p><p>You know, you've got cases like the Maria Butina case, where you've got -- you know, somebody else in the Russian government attacking the right-hand side of the American political spectrum.</p><p>You're going to have other -- you're going to have other types of information and the persuasion propaganda operations that are going to be undertaken.</p><p>Those things can cost a little bit more money, but it doesn't matter to Vladimir Putin. He's got -- you know, he's got a unity of government. He can do whatever he wants, and he has the resources to do it. [01:20:21] VAUSE: Yes, this is pretty much to do over, as we said, of how they worked in 2016. And that kind of reminds me that old -- you know, saying from President George W. Bush. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There's an old saying in Tennessee. I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee that says, \"Fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me, you can't get fooled again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Yes, after everything that has been written, said, tweeted, posted, and talked about, there are still some Americans out there who are ready to fall for the same scam. Sure.</p><p>HALL: Yes, this is -- you know, it -- this is really -- for me, extremely frustrating thing. And it -- and it's not so much -- I'm not frustrated so much with -- you know, my fellow Americans or really anybody in Western country.</p><p>The problem is, is that Putin and his intelligence services have become expert in a very, very unique skill set, and that is taking advantage of open societies. Which is extremely ironic because, of course, they don't live in an open society themselves.</p><p>But, you know in a society that so many people are on social media, so many people -- you know, have relatively short attention spans these days, myself included. You know, scanning your Twitter feed, you just don't have that much time to focus.</p><p>And Putin knows how to leverage all of these things, hit the hot topic, the hot-button topics. Hit them quickly, not a lot of detail, confuse people.</p><p>This is something that's very, very easy to do in open democracies where we put a great deal of value on free speech and the ability to communicate, basically, however, we want. The Russians know how to use that, and they're going to do it again.</p><p>VAUSE: We're out of time. But also, it begs the questions, if this is what Facebook has found, can you imagine what they've missed? Steve, good to speak with you. Thank you.</p><p>HALL: Oh, yes, my pleasure.</p><p>VAUSE: Cheers. Well, still to come on NEWSROOM L.A., a terrifying plane crash in Mexico. But reports say, everyone on board survived.</p><p>Also, the trade war between the U.S. and China, and the impact on those who have a thing for expensive tech gadgets.</p><p>[01:25:03] VAUSE: That overpriced iPhone X seems to be paying off for Apple. The thousand-dollar phone boosted revenue, 17 percent to more than $53 billion which helped this third-quarter profit of much better than expected $11.5 billion up 42 percent.</p><p>Apple sold 41 million iPhone X, the same number as a year ago. And with that Apple stock soared in after-hours trade, pushing the company's valuation closer to that magic trillion dollar mark that no publicly traded company has ever reached before.</p><p>But Apple, other big tech companies, and consumers could soon be feeling the pain of the trade war between the U.S. and China. Here's Samuel Burke.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: President Trump's trade war is barreling toward Silicon Valley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TRUMP: We are demanding fair and reciprocal trade.</p><p>BURKE: The latest round of proposed tariffs targets the Chinese hardware fuelling the tech sector. Things like semiconductors, and electronic circuits.</p><p>JOSH KALLMER, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY COUNCIL: There are certain kinds of machines that you and I never come into contact with, but that underpin a lot of the high-tech products that people buy.</p><p>BURKE: They are the key components that make smart devices, household appliances, and home security systems hum.</p><p>Everyday items like the iPad could be hit. The tablet has a chip from Intel which could be a target. East Hooters have taken off this year. Now, they face a 25 percent tariff. Even your favorite Netflix series could be in the firing line.</p><p>The streaming company's videos are played from the Amazon Cloud server, and that equipment comes from China.</p><p>Missing from the list, the Apple iPhone. CEO Tim Cook told CNN in June, he thought the device was safe.</p><p>TIM COOK, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, APPLE: I don't think that iPhone will get a tariff on it, is my belief. Based on what I've been told and what I've see, I just don't see that.</p><p>BURKE: Now, the president says, he's ready to tax almost all Chinese imports which would include the iPhone.</p><p>TRUMP: They went after our companies, and they stole our intellectual property.</p><p>BURKE: The administration says, the tariffs are meant to pressure China to fall in line. But experts say Olevia and the iPhone would be counterproductive. Even though the device is assembled in China, it's designed and manufactured in the U.S. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: 90 percent of that tariff, falls on value created by Americans. It is -- there is no other way to say it than to say that literally, the United States is taxing itself.</p><p>BURKE: And Apple may have the most to lose if China retaliates with tariffs of its own. 21 percent of the company sales are in China, leaving a clear target on America's most valuable company. Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, just hours before Americans would be able to make do-it- yourself guns at home. A federal judge has issued a temporary stop on releasing the blueprints for 3D plastic firearms, but the legal battle continues to try and find a permanent solution.</p><p>[01:30:30] VAUSE: Welcome back, everybody. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM, live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>Forty-nine people are in hospital after an Aeromexico flight crashed shortly after take off from Durango, Mexico. The pilot and one passenger are in critical condition. The plane was scheduled to fly to Mexico City with 101 people on board. Hail and heavy rain were reported in the area but it's known if the bad weather contributed to the crash.</p><p>Prosecutors are laying out their case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. They say he avoided paying taxes on millions earned through his lobbying work in the Ukraine. The defense, though, is pointing the finger at Manafort's deputy Rick Gates who's actually working with prosecutors.</p><p>Facebook has shut down dozens of pages and accounts which could be linked to Russia and may have lured hundreds of thousands of followers. The social media giant says it identified a new and coordinated effort to interfere in U.S. politics and mislead American voters ahead of November's congressional elections.</p><p>The United States has a love affair with firearms like no other country on earth. Exact numbers are hard to pin down but two years ago a report in the \"Washington Post\" calculated there are more guns in the U.S. than people -- 357 million firearms for a population of 317 million in 2016. That's just an estimate and it does not include firearms brought into the country illegally.</p><p>But it might just help explain why more than 30,000 people die each year in the United States because of guns. And focusing just on firearm homicides, the nonpartisan group (INAUDIBLE) put the number each year in the U.S. at more than 8,500.</p><p>The combined populations of Canada, France, Spain, Germany, the U.K., Australia and Norway, is roughly the same as the United States. Their combined number of firearm homicides, 516. And into that volatile mix, the Americans were just hours away from being able to make do it yourself guns in the privacy and convenience of their own homes -- unregistered, untraceable, uncheckable and possibly undetectable guns. All they needed was a 3D printer and the gun's technical designs.</p><p>But late Tuesday a federal judge issued a temporary nationwide injunction stopping a group known as Defense Distributed from making the blueprint for 3D plastic guns available online.</p><p>Attorneys general in eight states and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit because last month the Trump administration walked away from a five-year legal battle and reached a settlement with the Texas-based Defense Distributed deal which would have allowed the group to start releasing the blueprint on the web Wednesday.</p><p>Bob Ferguson is the attorney general for Washington State and the lead attorney in that multistate lawsuit. He is with us now from Seattle. Mr. Ferguson -- congratulations on the injunction.</p><p>It means it's now illegal to post blueprints for guns online, at least for now. What is the legal battle which you still have in front of you?</p><p>BOB FERGUSON, WASHINGTON STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL: You bet. Thanks so much for having me on. I really appreciate it.</p><p>And yes, it's a significant victory. What lies ahead is additional hearings before this judge. So while we received and were granted a restraining order, the judge still has to make ultimate decisions about the case.</p><p>In other words, this is in place for a relatively short period of time until the judge can issue a more final decision. That said, in order to get a restraining order in our courts, a judge has to conclude that we are likely to prevail on the merits of the case once he or she gets there.</p><p>So to get the restraining order is obviously a very strong indication that the judge thinks our case is especially strong.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Before the ruling though, Defense Distributed had already posted a number of gun designs on the web. Listen to Cody Wilson -- he's a self-described crypto-anarchist behind the group. Here he is talking to CNN's Lori Segall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CODY WILSON, DEFENSE DISTRIBUTED: Like I told you, I already uploaded the plans. I mean, you know, the ship has sailed. It's public domain information now. It's irrevocable. No one can take it back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. The download has apparently been disabled for now. But how much harm do you think has been caused by the blueprints which were posted before the injunction was in place? Well undoubtedly there has been harm which makes the Trump administration's decision to allow this to happen truly so shocking.</p><p>They were winning this case in Texas that you referred to before they caved for reasons that are unknown to everybody and allowed this to happen. I might add, the State Department has filed declaration after declaration in that case in Texas talking about the harm to public safety, the harm potentially for terrorism if entities like this are allowed to publish this information.</p><p>They retreated from that position for no apparent reason. So yes, there is some harm with folks being allowed to download that, but obviously if this information was to remain out there for additional days, weeks, months, years the harm would be even greater by exponential levels.</p><p>[01:35:09] So we're very grateful that the federal judge here in Seattle granted our request for a restraining order to have those taken down now.</p><p>VAUSE: With that I mind, the U.S. President tweeted on Tuesday, \"I'm looking into 3D plastic guns being sold to the public. Already spoke to the NRA -- doesn't seem to make much sense.\"</p><p>Shouldn't Donald Trump be talking to officials within his own administration given they're the ones who essentially allowed this to happen?</p><p>FERGUSON: Look, there is a reason why I've not lost a case yet against the Trump administration. I filed 32 of them. The reason is because the left hand never seems to know what the right hand is doing. They're sloppy as hell in how they execute their policies. And this case is a really good example.</p><p>Literally while the President is putting out that tweet that you just mentioned, his lawyers are in court today in Seattle arguing a different position altogether. It doesn't make any sense. And what's especially troubling with that is the issue and what's at stake is so great -- that public safety.</p><p>These ghost guns that are, as you mentioned earlier, untraceable. Metal detectors cannot trace them. They can be brought on to airplanes, into courthouses, those who have been convicted of domestic abuse or not eligible to have guns can now download them in the safety of their home and the privacy of their home -- truly terrifying. And that's why the President needs to communicate directly to his attorneys to stand down in this litigation.</p><p>VAUSE: As for the NRA, here's part of what their spokesperson said in a video which was posted on Twitter.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DANA LOESCH, SPOKESPERSON, NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION: Those guns -- yes, that hot term -- are not the kind that Peter Venkman carried. I'm actually talking about what Democrats call quote-unquote, \"ghost guns\" and the rest of us simply call freedom and innovation, 3D printed guns.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: I mean really -- freedom and innovation?</p><p>FERGUSON: Look, I don't know where to start. Look, I support the Second Amendment. I support the right to bear arms. I also support common sense gun laws.</p><p>This is at a whole another level. I just think that the vast majority of Americans do not think criminals should be able to access guns; domestic abusers who do not have the right to bear arms, should be able to download these in the safety of their home; and terrorists should not be able to get those and evade metal detectors.</p><p>I mean this is just basic common sense and yet this administration caved on this issue for no reason in a case they were winning. I am thankful though that we are still a nation of laws. As attorney general I can hold the President accountable to the rule of law. I'm accountable to the rule of law, the people in my country are accountable to the rule of law and so is the President. Now it's demonstrated yet again today in a courthouse here in Seattle.</p><p>VAUSE: Finally, I just want to finish with Cody Wilson again. He's with Defense Distributed. He argued that this is all about free speech. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LORI SEGALL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Are you worried that the implications of democratizing this type of information would lead to similar types of deaths.</p><p>WILSON: I guess the question then is like connected to the word you used, democracy. Is democracy dangerous or not? Right. Can the people be trusted or not?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: How do you respond to that?</p><p>FERGUSON: Well, it's hard to respond to an anarchist, right? Self- acknowledged anarchist. But what I would say is that this issue of the First Amendment -- he tried that argument in federal court in Texas and lost at the trial court level, and lost at the court of Appeals level and the Supreme Court chose not to take the case.</p><p>So I do not think that that argument is going to be persuasive in my case here in the western district of Washington. I'm confident we'll prevail as we have in every case that's had a decision -- the 32 cases I've brought against this Trump administration, so far.</p><p>VAUSE: Thirty-two and counting, I guess. Mr. Ferguson --</p><p>FERGUSON: That's correct.</p><p>VAUSE: -- thank you so much.</p><p>FERGUSON: Thank you.</p><p>VAUSE: Coming up here, no help from the weather for firefighters in California as they battle some of the most devastating wildfires the state has ever seen.</p><p>[01:38:42] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Firefighters in California are making slow progress controlling more than a dozen wildfires but extreme heat and strong winds are not helping and a cool down is probably days away.</p><p>We have more than from CNN Nick Watts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): This apocalyptic blaze is eating through thousands of acres of forest, so large it's visible from space. The flames have destroyed more than 800 homes and counting.</p><p>The statistics are stunning but the personal stories, they're the hardest.</p><p>(on camera): You could see the flames in your rearview mirror as you're driving away?</p><p>STACEY KELLY, RESIDENT: Yes. That was the terrifying part. It was like a wall of fire. It was like a train, it had a noise. It was awful. I thought I was on a sci-fi movie.</p><p>WATT: Driving away from a home you may never see again.</p><p>KELLY: And that's what happened. Lots and lots and lots of memories, yes -- they're gone. I mean everything's gone.</p><p>WATT: Everything?</p><p>KELLY: Everything.</p><p>WATT: What did you manage to save?</p><p>KELLY: I have two Rubbermaid tubs that I threw some stuff in. Some scrubs for work.</p><p>WATT (voice over): A nurse -- she's back at work already.</p><p>KELLY: I actually felt better yesterday than I had in a long time because I was at work and I felt like I had a purpose.</p><p>WATT (on camera): Right.</p><p>(voice over): This was her home before the fire.</p><p>(on camera): And this is all that's left of Stacey Kelly's house -- rubble and a few charred trees. In fact her entire little cul-de-sac -- six houses, all completely destroyed.</p><p>But then if you look just across the street, the random nature of wildfires -- another house still standing.</p><p>KELLY: I just feel empty. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't think I'll rebuild that house. I don't think so.</p><p>(voice over): The fires swept through the west side of Redding, population more than 90,000 and through rural communities to the north and west.</p><p>JANET LANDLES, RESIDENT: I'm a country girl. I grew up in the woods. My dad's a logger.</p><p>WATT: Like many who attended a town hall meeting here in Redding, Janet Landles' (ph) from French Gulch, population 492 -- lost everything.</p><p>LANDLES: It's when you hit -- your head hits the pillow and you remember your home. And you remember -- my great grandmother's rocking chair, and the things your children made you. You know, when you were a little --</p><p>WATT: The town hall was largely residents thanking first responders for saving lives but so many worldly possessions lost to the flames.</p><p>LANDLES: My husband's dead and all of this artwork is gone. And you know, you just remember all of the stuff you -- I don't that care that George Foreman melted. I don't care that I need a new refrigerator. But I do care about my great grandmother's thimble, you know? Those are the things that I care about.</p><p>WATT (on camera): Right now there are 17,000 homes under threat of flames across California; more than a dozen wildfires burning right now in this state.</p><p>And here's a sobering statistic. Of the ten biggest wildfires in California history, four of them took place within the last year.</p><p>Nick Watt, CNN -- Redding, California.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: And with that let's check in with meteorologist Pedram Javaheri with more on this. Ok. So the weather is not great. We're looking at a cool down in what -- how many days?</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I think in about four or so days. So we still have about three days left of big time heat -- John, but improving conditions finally, of course, after about a month of extreme heat.</p><p>The month of August here in the next couple of hours across the state of California and once it gets there we'll begin to see the transition hopefully as we go in towards this weekend. [01:44:56] But the hot, dry conditions -- that's unfortunately still going to be in the forecast. The firefighters have been able to make up slight ground here as far as improving the coverage of areas as far as how much land has been able to be contained.</p><p>But we know at one point in the last couple of days, this fire -- the Carr Fire, that is, was consuming some 11 hectares of land per minute. That's equivalent to a football field being consumed every three seconds. So it really talks about the ferocity of this particular fire, how quickly it was destroying land and of course, consuming one home after another.</p><p>And incredibly if you look at this, and the number has actually in the last 24 hours increased as far as the active large fires in the western United States, up from 90 to almost 100 now. And the conditions still right for the development of wildfires but we know the next few days again, going to see some conditions begin to improve.</p><p>The temperatures, notice this -- as uniform as it gets, all of it staying a couple of degrees above average, all of it with a zero percent chance of rainfall. That's what you don't want to see.</p><p>But what really is very hopeful here is as you look at the long-range models, the heat that's been leading to historic temperatures in the month of July, that will begin to break down at least noticeably on Saturday and Sunday and then significantly come Monday and Tuesday.</p><p>Even a slight chance -- I'm certainly not really counting on any rainfall but a slight chance of few showers possible. But Monday and Tuesday, John -- temperatures could be below average in an area that has been at record values. So, better news in store there.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. Pedram -- we appreciate that. Thank you.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Thanks.</p><p>On the outskirts of Berlin, in over two years three baby girls have been found abandoned, all of the same mother who could have safely left the girls no questions asked at what's known as a baby hatch. This time she didn't and now police fear baby number four could be on its way.</p><p>CNN's Atika Shubert reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Inside this box -- a small mattress, a flannel blanket and a slip of paper.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And inside there is a letter from the mother.</p><p>SHUBERT: It reads, \"We know that living your child with us is not easy for you. We want to assure you we will take loving care of your baby.\" Dr. Gerhard Mann (ph) is the pastor at (INAUDIBLE) hospital. He tells us some baby hatches have not been used for years, of course. But every child that is put in this baby hatch is a saved life. Here, a mother with an unwanted pregnancy can anonymously deposit a newborn baby in a baby hatch.</p><p>(on camera): Now there are dozens of baby hatches in Germany and also many hospitals like this one where a mother can deliver a baby anonymously. But police in Berlin are asking why neither possibility was used in the case of three abandoned babies all from the same mother.</p><p>(voice over): The first baby was left here at the bus stop just outside a hospital. The next summer, another child abandoned just a few minutes' drive away. And last year, the third baby was left outside a front door in this neighborhood. The children were taken into foster care.</p><p>This year, police appeal to the public for information, fearing another child could be on the way. They distributed these, photos of the baby clothes that were worn on the day they were abandoned, but no answers yet.</p><p>\"We can only hope that any fourth child will be taken care of,\" this officer says, \"left in a baby hatch or a hospital so that the child can helped as quickly as possible.\"</p><p>At (INAUDIBLE) hospital, Dr. Mann tells us that the baby hatch hasn't been used for at least two years but he hopes the mother will know it is here for her to use.</p><p>\"She wanted for her babies to live,\" he says. \"She wants them to be found quickly and for that reason no one should hate her.\"</p><p>A waiting box, a missing mother and a mystery still unsolved.</p><p>Atika Shubert, CNN -- Berlin.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Television's Alan Alda has told the world he's been living with Parkinson's for years. Coming up, his diagnosis, advice for others with the disease, and also the latest research and treatment.</p><p>[01:49:04] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, Neil Diamond surprised firefighters in Colorado performing one of his all-time classics, \"Sweet Caroline\". He lives in the area where fire has burned over 48 square kilometers. The music legend recently retired from touring after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.</p><p>And on Tuesday, actor Alan Alda revealed he's been living with Parkinson's for more than three years. The 82-year-old went public because he noticed his hand was twitching and he worried that a sad, or depressing, gloomy story was only a matter of time and he says that's not what he wanted.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALAN ALDA, ACTOR: To be immobilized by fear and think the worst thing has happened to you, it hasn't happened to you. You still have things you can do.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>ALDA: I'm taking boxing lessons.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Three days a week, I read.</p><p>ALDA: Three times a week. I do singles tennis a couple of times a week. I march to Sousa music because marching to march music is good for Parkinson's.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, joining us now with more on what we know about Parkinson's is Dr. Michele Tagliati -- you're going to say that for me one more time. He's the director of the Movement Disorders Program at the Department of Neurology at Cedars Sinai Medical Center.</p><p>Sorry -- one more time. Michele --</p><p>DR. MICHELE TAGLIATI, DIRECTOR, MOVEMENT DISORDERS PROGRAM-CEDARS SINAI MEDICAL CENTER: Michele Tagliati.</p><p>VAUSE: Tagliati. I knew I was going to get that wrong. So I apologize.</p><p>Ok. Alan Alda, he talks a lot about staying active during that interview on CBS. On Twitter he had this advice. \"I decided to let people know I have Parkinson's to encourage others to take action. I was diagnosed three and a half years ago but my life is full. I act, I could talk, send in my podcast which I love. If you get a diagnosis, keep moving.\"</p><p>The recent research would suggest that's actually pretty good advice, right?</p><p>TAGLIATI: Absolutely. That is a fantastic announcement that Alan Alda made for all patients with Parkinson's disease, a celebrity that comes out swinging with this positive, you know, message which is actually true. This is why we tell our patients when they come to the clinic.</p><p>VAUSE: Because by staying active, you actually delay the onset of the worst symptoms, right?</p><p>TAGLIATI: Correct. Exercise is the only remedy that we know as of today that can slow down the progression of the disease. VAUSE: Alda said he actually had no symptoms when he went in to be tested but he did have an episode of acting out a dream, which is why it was actually concerning in the first place.</p><p>This is what he said on CBS.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALDA: I asked for a scan because I thought I might have it. I read an article by Jane Brody in \"The New York Times\" that indicated that if you have -- if you act out your dreams -- there's a good chance you might -- that might be a very early symptom that -- where nothing else shows.</p><p>And by acting out your dreams, I mean I was having a dream that someone was attacking me and I threw a sack of potatoes at them. But what I was really doing is throwing a pillow at my wife.</p><p>I didn't have any symptoms. The doctor said, why do you want a scan? You don't have any symptoms. And I said I want to know if there is anything I can do, I want to do it before things start to show up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Explain the link here. How is someone acting out their dream linked as being a symptom of possibly having Parkinson's?</p><p>TAGLIATI: So that's correct. And we are starting to recognize that there are certain symptoms like acting out dreams or losing your sense of smell, sometimes constipation that can anticipate, that can precurse (ph) the typical symptoms of Parkinson's disease -- the shaking, the stiffness.</p><p>And the reason is that we're starting to recognize that this disease seems to progress through the brain and if part of the brain where the dreams are sort of controlled and formed is very close to the part of the brain that controls the movements. And so there is sort of a step before is where the dreams start to become unusual.</p><p>VAUSE: Wow. It's fascinating how all of this is interconnected and how it all works together.</p><p>Right now there's no cure for Parkinson's but you know, there has been some progress and research. We have this clinical trial under way in Japan at Kyoto University.</p><p>[01:55:01] Essentially, I may have this -- tell me if I've got this right -- they plan on injecting stem cells into the brain to increase dopamine levels because dopamine is a neurotransmitter. A lack of dopamine can impact motor skills, can cause all the shaking -- that kind of stuff.</p><p>You've looked at that research and what it was doing -- what is your opinion? How promising is that or not?</p><p>TAGLIATI: So I mean -- I'm a researcher so every research is promising and stem cells, of course, evoke a lot of hope, you know, in many people. The stem cells promise to sort of regenerate these dying parts of the brain.</p><p>And so we look at that research with a lot of respect. We tend to use stem cells to study the disease. You can reproduce personalized parts of the brain and really study subject by subject, you know.</p><p>Alan Alda said that today -- everyone has a different, slightly different type of Parkinson's disease. So it becomes essential to be able to study your Parkinson's disease, his Parkinson's disease, here Parkinson's disease. And stem cells can do that.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, what's interesting though, we hear a lot about Parkinson's when there is a celebrity, when there's Alan Alda --</p><p>TAGLIATI: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: -- when there's Neil Diamond, when there's Michael J. Fox. It seems the disease, though, is lot more common than many people might realize. What is that -- 10 million people around world?</p><p>One study expects the number of sufferers in the U.S. to double, what, by 2030 -- to well over a million people. That has a lot of consequences obviously for the health care system but also what's driving those numbers? What's driving this increase?</p><p>TAGLIATI: In one word -- aging.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>TAGLIATI: The population is aging. We are eating better, we are exercising. We are arriving as a population at older and older ages in reasonable good shape. And that brings with them the risk of developing Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. So it's -- as far as we understand, this is purely a consequence of the general aging of the population.</p><p>VAUSE: Very quickly, we have 30 seconds left --</p><p>TAGLIATI: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: -- for anyone who wants to know the best sort of lifestyle, the best thing they can do -- is there anything you can do to try and help avoid this disease later in life?</p><p>TAGLIATI: Well, that's only exercising; obesity seems to be associated. We are finding some parallel between diabetes and Parkinson's disease. So eat well, sleep well and exercise.</p><p>VAUSE: It's the old advice. The old advice is a good advice.</p><p>Dr. Michele Tagliati --</p><p>TAGLIATI: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: -- thank you so much. TAGLIATI: My pleasure. Thank you for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: And thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm John Vause.</p><p>The news continues next with the thunder from Down Under, the wonder from the West Perth's favorite son Michael Holmes, right after the break.</p><p>[01:57:41] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2018080118CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SY0-ST11-JB20-G3VY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 1, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

One, two, three -- there we go, three -- a good gavel, a good man, it's  Tuesday, it is the 12th of June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Tonight, judgment is imminent for AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  We will know in  the next hour if the US judge will allow the merger of these two giants to  go through.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Singapore Summit, Donald Trump wants fewer nukes and more condos in  North Korea.  Is that what they talked about?  And the British Prime  Minister makes compromises and in doing so gets her Brexit bill further  through Parliament.  There is so much in the next hour.  I am Richard  Quest, live in London and yes, I mean business.  </p><p> Good evening.  Busy hour that you and I have together.  A day for history  books on every continent.  We will have full analysis of the Singapore  Summit over the course of the program.  You are also going to hear from two  top chief executives on the British government's Brexit vote which is  working its way through the Parliament and we will also have the verdict,  the judgment that corporate America has been waiting for.  </p><p> Why is the corporate American?  An entire media industry, the ramifications  from Judge Leon's decision in Time Warner and AT&amp;T will go far and wide  across the anti-trust rules.  Moments from now, the Judge's decision will  reshape media and set the standards for antitrust regulations in the United  States.  </p><p> Judge Richard Leon will determine whether the $85 billion takeover of our  parent company, Time Warner can go forward.  Huge implications whichever  way you look at it for AT&amp;T which insists it needs the deal to complete and  for you and me as viewers as a member of company that control content and  distribution shrinks.  </p><p> That is the courthouse.  The leaders of corporate America deciding whether  to go forward with deals of their own.  That is the courthouse.  As soon as  we have the decision, we will bring it to here on \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p> So, South Korea's Defense Ministry says, it needs to figure out exactly  what President Trump meant when he announced that joint US-South Korean war  games will come to an end.  The US President was talking to journalists and  he spoke for more than an hour after his summit with Kim Jong-un.  He  called the war games inappropriate and said he wants to bring the 32,000 US  troops stationed in South Korea back home.  </p><p> The two leaders signed that agreement in which Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his  commitment to complete denuclearization and President Trump gave security  guarantees to North Korea and said this meeting was just the beginning.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I also will be inviting  Chairman Kim at the appropriate time to the White House, I think it is  really going to be something that will be very important.  And he has  accepted.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  Foreign affairs columnist, Bobby Ghosh joins me now.  We can go  backwards and forwards on whether it was worth it, what they discussed, did  they get all that Kim Jong-un said what he's done before.  In a nutshell,  though, before we parse it, was it worth it?  </p><p> BOBBY GHOSH, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST:  Politically, for both players,  yes, and in any real terms, probably not.  Donald Trump gets to play to his  base.  He keeps a campaign promise.  Kim Jong-un gets to parade on the  world stage, gets both of them get an amazing photo opportunity.  It gets  declared a historic moment just the fact that the two men met at all.  </p><p> But then you parse the deal, you look more closely at the papers they  signed and you realize there is not a lot there.  This is all vague, it's  all sort of well-meaning words that don't actually amount to any roadmap  that will lead us to where Donald Trump wants to go, which is a  denuclearized North Korea or even where North Korea wants to go, which is  the full removal of economic sanctions.  </p><p> Neither of those two destinations, we don't have roadmaps to either of them  at this point.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, but we were never going to get full roadmaps from a meeting  that was thrown together in three months in such a fashion.  And the  argument of course is that merely meeting -- I mean, the analysis I have  seen suggest, look, merely meeting means that it's much harder now for any  form of armed conflict to take place.  </p><p> GHOSH:  That is if you believe that armed conflict was a likelihood even  before this meeting.  I personally don't.  I don't think there was any  scenario in which the United States for one was going to war with a regime  that has a million men army --  </p><p> [16:05:16]  </p><p> GHOSH:   -- and nuclear weapons.  There was a lot of rhetoric, it was  overheated in my opinion, but it was never actually going to lead to war,  but that having been said, the fact that the two men have met and have  agree to keep talking -- that second piece, that agreed to keep talking  themselves and officials below that level, that's probably a good thing.  </p><p> Better jaw-jaw than talk of war-war, as Winston Churchill might have said.  </p><p> QUEST:  Indeed, and the \"New York Times\" puts it this way though, this  afternoon, suggesting that actually, what you are really talking about is  containment within the existing parameters for North Korea rather than  abandonment of nuclear weapons.  If that is the case, and again, this is  \"The Times,\" this is me, it suggests that really, you're looking at an Iran  type of situation where all you're doing is aiming to contain rather than  abolish?  </p><p> GHOSH:  No, actually not as even as good as the Iran deal if we look at it  again more closely.  The United States is giving security guarantees to the  North Koreans, the North Koreans are not giving -- the word \"guarantee\"  does not leave Kim Jong-un's lips even once during this entire discussion.  </p><p> So, it seems like a very one-sided deal.  I would disagree with the \"New  York Times\" there.  I don't think this is containment.  This is enablement  in some degree.  It basically takes North Korea's nuclear program and  leaves it intact for an unspecified number of months, years going forward,  at the same time, unilaterally, without consulting with the South Koreans,  President Trump announces that there will be no more war games.  Those  military exercises which were a big part of the containment.  </p><p> Keep in mind, for decades, containment has been the only option and those  military exercises have been the main instrument, if you like of  containment, now that instrument has been taken off the table.  Where is  the containment?  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, Bobby, good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p> GHOSH:  Anytime.  </p><p> QUEST:  There's plenty for us to talk about that we will keep looking at  this as we continue, there is so much.  The thing we are watching out for  is the decision in the AT&amp;T case -- the AT&amp;T and Time Warner -- parent  company of this network -- the Judge any time now, it may even have started  reading his judgment.  As soon as we get an idea of what that judgment is,  whence CNN will be bringing you that decision and the analysis, because  it's more than just a case about this company and AT&amp;T, it is antitrust and  it promises to change the landscape of corporate America.  We will have  that in a moment.  </p><p> Choppy is the best word to describe Wall Street's changing.  Looking at the  graph and you'll see what I mean.  Although it was predominantly down,  having --</p><p> [16:10:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  -- been off very sharply at around what?  Three o'clock in the  afternoon, rallies back up again and ekes out just a small loss at 1.58 and  I think that that economy shows you more than anything else the nature of  the market, the way indeed it rallied.  And the NASDAQ closed at a record  high, so you have a record -- all the market, the two markets that barely  made it -- sure did.  </p><p> And if you look at the traveling trading post, it is the 19th record this  year.  Later in the week of course, when I am back in New York, we will  very much look forward to getting back to the trading post and changing the  numbers actually for you on the boards.  </p><p>Tesla shares ended in the day up.  They've been as much as six percent  higher after one analyst raised the forecast of deliveries of Model 3.  It  fell back when Elon Musk confirmed the company will lay off 9 percent of  its workforce.  Paul La Monica is following it all.  </p><p> The stock is still up though some 30 percent or 40 percent since its lows  earlier in the year last year, so Musk is doing something right.  </p><p> PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think that investors clearly do  believe Elon Musk when he talks and tweets about these ambitious goals for  when Model 3's are going to be delivered to consumers and start hitting the  streets.  Of course, the problem that Tesla has faced is that, they have  been going for a lot of cash, and they have been losing money and  unfortunately, for workers that is going to mean that there will be some  layoffs and I think, you know, the sad reality is that Tesla bulls will  probably applaud this because it may finally show some financial discipline  from Elon Musk which isn't something that I think is always associated with  him.  </p><p> QUEST:  Right, so the first point of course is, will they meet their  however many thousand, I think it was 5,000 or whatever Model 3's that they  are expecting to produce.  They are getting close to it with 3, 000 to  3,500, to 4,000 -- so that's the first issue.  </p><p> But then of course, there is the ramp up of production over the whole model  range and the trucks and all the other things.  Is there a feeling that  Tesla has pardoned upon, turned the corner?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, I think that the key question is does Tesla have the  financial resources to do everything that Musk ambitiously wants to do.  As  you pointed out, Richard, there is the Model 3.  There is the Model S and  Model X of course, and then there is the semi-trucks and then they are also  still integrating Solar City, which is going to be building solar roof  panels on homes and other buildings.  Musk has a lot on his plate just at  Tesla.  </p><p> Then you have SpaceX, you have the Boring Company, you have all of these  tweets that he is lashing out against the media.  He is a very busy guy and  I think it's a question of whether or not he can accomplish everything that  he is setting out to do because he is just one person and last I checked,  cloning was not one of the many things that Musk is working on.  </p><p> QUEST:  No, Paul, you and I have argued and discussed this before.  I am in  the camp that says the guy is a visionary.  Yes, he may be a bit weird and  bizarre occasionally, but he has done more in a short period of time than  most Chief Execs do in their entire life.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Oh, I am not by any -- you know, I am not at all trying to say  that Elon Musk should be criticized for having the great visionary ideas  that he has, but there is a difference between doing what he does and  saying that you're going to do something and being able to actually  accomplish it.  </p><p> And, you know, also, I don't remember Steve Jobs and other visionary  repeatedly bashing the media the way Musk does as well.  So, from a self- serving standpoint, it's a little frustrating that Elon Musk lash out at us  all the time.  </p><p> QUEST:  Care to take a punt on what Judge Leon is going to decide.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  I am not going there at all.  We are going to find out very  soon, so I will punt on taking a punt.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, but I think you'd agree whichever way it goes, I was  just thinking about this.  Whichever way it goes, the landscape for  antitrust and corporate America, never mind just the media industry,  shifts, if he decides in favor of AT&amp;T-Time Warner, then the vertical rules  change.  </p><p> If he decides in favor of the Justice Department, then they most certainly  change.  So, whichever way this goes, what do you think?  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Yes, I think it is safe to say that if Judge Leon rules in of  AT&amp;T and Time Warner and doesn't put may condition on the deal.  There  likely will be other media mergers coming and the other thing I think,  Richard is if this deal does go through, I can tell my mother, \"I work for  the phone company,\" and she might finally have some understanding of what I  do for a living.  </p><p> QUEST:  She might finally say, \"You've got an honest job.\"  You've got an  honest job and you're working for a real company, and you might know that  nonsense on the media.  All right, Paul La Monica, Guru La Monica.  </p><p> LA MONICA:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p> QUEST:  There is an ace to stop the rebellion --</p><p> [16:15:16]  </p><p> QUEST:  -- by comprising with the MPs who wanted the final say on Brexit.   Now, some of the main supporters had wanted a more definitive say if they  disagreed on the Brexit deal.  It would have undermined the Prime  Minister's negotiating ability in the long run.  That's according to the  Brexit Minister.  </p><p> (START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DAVID DAVIES, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE:  The government cannot  demonstrate the flexibility necessary for successful negotiation if its  hands are tied midway through the process.  That will do nothing but  guarantee a bad deal for Britain.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> QUEST:  It was the key vote on a string of amendments that was proposed by  the Upper House of Lords.  A former Justice Minister has resigned ahead of  the vote saying that Brexit is detrimental to business.  Now, the Minister  -- the former Minister Phillip Lee said, \"In extensive consultations with  local employers -- large and small -- I have been warned that they expect  Brexit, as it is currently being pursued would have a negotiated settlement  will damage their business.\"  </p><p> This shows the febrile nature of the British tabloids where absolutely,  unequivocal about the role of Parliament that it has to say Brexit.  If you  look at the \"Daily Express,\" \"Ignore the will of the people at your peril,\"  and \"The Sun\" delivered a warning to MP's, \"Great Britain or Great  Betrayal.\"  Now, you can't necessarily see this here, but if you noticed,  on the cover, it is peppered with British icons.  </p><p> You've got the Angel of the North in Northern England, you've got the mini  car, you've got the red bus and of course, you've got the red arrows and  you've got a spit fire.  You could see more on the picture there.  </p><p> Tim Martin is the Founder and Chairman of JD Wetherspoon, a branded hotel  chain, he joins me now.  I think I am not doing you a disservice when I say  you are an ardent Brexiteer.  </p><p> TIM MARTIN, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JD WETHERSPOON:  I have been called out,  Richard, and I won't argue, you're right.  </p><p> QUEST:  All right, and so you have a plan, you have a policy.  You have an  idea of what you think this should look like afterwards.  You can't be  pleased with the way it is going at the moment.  </p><p> MARTIN:  I think it's turning into a bit of a dog's dinner.  I think that  the government should approach the negotiations in another way.  The EU is  a protectionist system.  It charges tariffs.  We could have made food and  everything else cheaper in the shops.  We have eliminated the tariffs and  just left the EU and instead of paying them 39 billion, we could have  allocated that money to UK consumers, so you wouldn't have had -- we could  have regained control of our fishing.  </p><p> If you'd done those three things, you wouldn't have been reliant on the EU.   We would be better off now and I think we would be better off than if we  had a deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  But you couldn't not pay the exit bill.  I mean, in the sense that  that would be reneging on previously agreed expenditure that the UK signed  up for.  </p><p> MARTIN:  Well, I understand that the legal advice on that is there is no  legal obligation to pay it and certainly, and certainly, no one has turned  around and explained to the British public or even the media exactly on  what basis there is some sort of obligation to pay that.  I think we are  paying it to try and persuade them to do a free trade deal.  </p><p> QUEST:  Would you be in favor more of a -- as the FT put in this morning,  the Donald Trump approach?  Tell them where to go, tell them where to stick  it and if they don't like it, end of subject?  </p><p> MARTIN:  Well, the trouble with Donald Trump is he is a divisive character.   I would go for the approach of saying, we want to be friends with you in  the EU, you are very good suppliers.  You are nice people, but we aren't  dependent on a deal with you.  This is what we are going to (inaudible) --  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> QUEST:  But we are -- this is the problem here.  Every business person I  speak to says that if we crash out of the EU, then the effect will be  devastating on the British government.  </p><p> MARTIN:  That is a complete fallacy and it is just politics transferred  into the minds of the Board rooms who have argued that if we leave the EU,  its protectionist system, prices in the shops go down plus, we don't have  to pay them $10 billion a year, plus, we regain control of our fishing  market, plus we --  </p><p> QUEST:  But every company that does business across the channel will  suddenly be faced with a level of complexity that they don't currently  employ.  It would crash out.  </p><p> MARTIN:  No, because you abolish tariffs for the rest of the world, America  for example, no tariffs and that means no tariffs from the EU.  So you  would be in a better position.  The main thing to understand is the EU is 7  percent of the world, it is a protectionist system, it has tariffs for the  other 93 percent -- abolish it, get out of the EU, you're trading with 93  percent of the world.  We will get our prices down and our pubs tomorrow  for food and drink, if we leave the EU and the customs union, a lot of  people in Britain just don't understand that, but that is the truth.  </p><p> QUEST:  But if you're told as we are that 40 percent of the exports do go  to the --  </p><p> [16:20:15]  </p><p> QUEST:   -- and it's more, it's about 50 percent to 55 percent, do go to  the EU, they will be tariff-ed immediately by the other side, and even if  they are not tariff-ed, there will be a complexity to doing this.  Let's  forget about Northern Ireland there, that's entirely different.  Let's just  talk about on the back burner at the moment.  There would be a difficulty  in just saying goodbye, turn the lights off.  </p><p> MARTIN:  None at all.  We trade with the EU.  We buy champagne, we buy wine  et cetera, we can switch tomorrow and eliminate all trade with the EU if  you want to and get wine from America, from the new world, Australia et  cetera, from South America, and it's not going to make an iota of  difference.  </p><p> It will force the EU to become more competitive.  At the moment, we sell --  the top selling house wine is from Australia and New Zealand and it has got  a tariff, so why should our customers pay tariff to Brussels?  </p><p> QUEST:  Now, one thing that is clear, the EU has fought harder to maintain  the integrity of the single market.  Now, they always said they would, but  the British people were told by Brexiteers, not you particularly, but by  others they were told when push comes to shove, when the crunch time  happens, the EU will cave so far -- but that does not appear to be the  case.  </p><p> MARTIN:  They will cave in five minutes flat if we say we are going to  leave without a deal.  We are going to abolish all tariffs and if you dare  charge us tariffs, watch your BMW sales and your champagne sales, we are  the second biggest market for both those products, I think in the whole  world, go to zero.  </p><p> QUEST:  And they are prepared to accept that.  Someone is saying -- someone  said that is the price that Merkel will tell her people, \"That's the price  we are going to pay.\"  </p><p> MARTIN:  I am going to have to swear in television --  </p><p> QUEST:  No, you're not.  </p><p> MARTIN:  But no, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  </p><p> QUEST:  Tim, it is always good to have you.  I noticed, there's been a lot  of talk about champagne, a lot of talk about all of these things and there  is no evidence of it in front of us.  </p><p> MARTIN:  I am disappointed.  </p><p> QUEST:  You're the hotelier and hospitality, man, you should be -- good to  see you, Tim.  </p><p> MARTIN:  Thanks a lot.  </p><p> QUEST:  As always.  European markets have ended the day mixed.  The FTSE  100 closed down by 0.42 percent followed by the CAC 40 in France.  </p><p>Japan is transforming mobility for those who struggle to get around, and  that includes those with disabilities or the elderly.  In \"Business  Frontier,\" Anna Stewart looks at how tech is making their lives easier  including wheelchairs on demand.  </p><p> (START VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Approximately 15 percent of the world's  population has some form of disability according to the World Health  Organization.  And for those one billion people, a routine every day task  can be a daunting ordeal.  </p><p> Kanai was 10 years old when she was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.   Four years ago, age 20, a wheelchair became a key to her mobility.  After  being impressed by the Whill electric wheelchair, she decided to start  working for the company.  </p><p> KANAI, WHEELCHAIR USER:  (Through an interpreter).  Japan has limited space  in public facilities like this market.  So, wheelchairs need to be agile.   When I was using an ordinary wheelchair, I used to check on Google Maps to  look for obstacles in the streets that might block my mobility.  </p><p> Now, I can go over most of that, so I do not need to prepare in advance.  </p><p> STEWART:  That's because Whill uses the omni wheel, a normal wheel  surrounded by many separate tires which all rotate.  It means, these chairs  can both bridge gaps and still turn in a tight radius.  </p><p> It is not the only company to make these advances in personal mobility  vehicles, but Whill's latest innovation is set to take its unique features  to another level altogether.  </p><p> Introducing the autonomous wheelchair.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through an interpreter).  It's like either you have an  app and you call up the wheelchair.  It arrives, you use it, and then  release it when you're done.  </p><p> STEWART:  And it's not just designed to help disabled people.  It could  help Japan's aging population, too.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through an interpreter).  There is a negative image  associated with wheelchairs.  Many people say they would rather stay at  home rather than use a wheelchair, which means they stay inside and become  an (inaudible).  They are physically and mentally -- if we can change the  image, we can help more people go out and live a healthy, full life.  </p><p> STEWART:  Working in collaboration with Panasonic, the autonomous wheel  launched a trial at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, and now Panasonic hopes the  technology will be rolled out in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through a translator).  Come 2020, we would like to  make this kind of mobility available not only at airports, but also in  towns and stadiums.

But  here we are. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Now, the analysts believe a decision will trigger a domino effect  across corporate America once it takes place.  So keep the AT&amp;T domino  towards, yes, are more likely than Comcast will fight for 21st Century Fox  and that's been of course against Disney, that's a huge bid in its own  right, another global bid. </p><p> It could then bolden CVS; the drugstore trying to buy Aetna, another  vertical, and that's a deal worth $69 billion.  And then you got the  smaller media companies than AT -- no, taking on the giants.  Now, that's  the new -- that way. </p><p> But tip the dominos towards no deal or Time Warner may break up, you can  see the selloff of Turner, which is our parent and CNN, which is part of  Turner.  It would show the Justice Department is taking an activist role  for AT&amp;T on competition grounds. </p><p> The trouble for mergers between Sprint and mobile would also -- T-Mobile  would also be absolutely in trouble, all of which if the Justice Department  prevails in this case.  And when you put it all together and you see all  the various different manifestations and the dominos that can fall, you  realize that it all hinges on one little tip of the domino. </p><p> It all starts with one little push.  Dylan Byers is CNNMoney's senior  reporter for media and politics and joins me now.  Which way -- oh, you  don't have, you can plead the Fifth on this. </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> DYLAN BYERS, CNNMONEY SENIOR REPORTER FOR MEDIA &amp; POLITICS:  What I will  say is you can't sort of read the tea leaves here in the fact that the  judge has invited the media back to hear his ruling which he's going to  read out loud.</p><p> Usually in a case like this, you just have a written ruling because there's  a simple decision one way or the other and then the dominos fall as you  showed one way or the other.  So what that says to me is that he's going to  have a complex ruling -- it's very likely and I think this is the  conventional wisdom right now among analysts and the media, that he will  approve the deal, but he will approve the deal with certain conditions.</p><p> Now, that's just a conventional wisdom, anything could happen here.  The  fact that this even went to trial and took 500-plus days was not something  I think that AT&amp;T and Time Warner anticipated.  So, we're on pins and  needles here waiting to see what happens.</p><p> And like you said, the ramifications for the industry are enormous.</p><p> QUEST:  All right, the way in which it moves forward.  So for example, if  AT&amp;T loses, if -- and Time Warner lose, does that transaction fall apart  because the deadline is next week to complete the deal, and after that  deadline, either side can if they wanted to get out. </p><p> And what we hear of course is, there are some who are saying, since the  fall in AT&amp;T share price, actually Time Warner would be wise to look  elsewhere.</p><p> BYERS:  Well, look, I do think it would be a major blow to have the judge  rule against the deal.  I think what happens after that, look, there's  always the possibility of appeal, there are various ways this can go.  But  yes, it would conceivably, it would put Time Warner back on the market.</p><p> And then the question which she poses, do you then break up the Time Warner  assets, all of a sudden are things like \"Hbo\", Turner, CNN, are they  looking for buyers elsewhere? But you know, the -- part of the issue here  with the judge's ruling is what's really in question is what right do  telecom companies and tech companies have to buy a media acquisition?</p><p> [16:35:00] And if you say no to that, you put a freeze on potential M&amp;A  across the board, at least, you know, conceivably through the rest of the  Trump administration.  If you say yes to that, you open up the flood gates  of mergers and acquisitions and media that may ultimately result -- you  know, you look now, we've got really about across the tech, media and  telecom space, about 16 big companies.</p><p> Ten years from now if this deal goes through, all of a sudden, you could  have half that money.  And you could really be talking about a future where  all media is owned by technology companies and telecom companies and is  becoming increasingly hard to really understand the difference between  those players since they are all playing in the content game, and they are  trying at least to bring that content direct to consumers without any  middle men. </p><p> QUEST:  The judge knows his stuff, doesn't he? I mean, here's one of the  experts in not only anti-trust, but also having done the Comcast-NBC case,  so in many ways would be regarded as the right -- the right judge on the  right case. </p><p> BYERS:  He is and there's been a lot of -- there's been a lot of cloud  around this decision, about sort of, you know, was there any political  influence here from President Trump in terms -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> BYERS:  Blocking this deal, even because CNN, our network was involved.  At  the end of the day, this is coming down to a judge who like you said has a  great deal of experience, who to the best of our knowledge adheres very  close to the letter of the law and will make a decision based off of not  the considerations of executives or -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> BYERS:  Politicians, but of the considerations of the consumer.  And that  is that, at the end of the day is all you can hope for.</p><p> QUEST:  Haven't you got a newsletter to go and write? </p><p> BYERS:  I do, I actually do, get sort of benign for the start on tomorrow's  newsletter.        </p><p> QUEST:  Then let me stop you because there's a newsletter, we'll have a lot  more on this once we have the decision.  Thanks Dylan, it's called -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BYERS:  Thank you -- </p><p> QUEST:  It looks as -- well, the worlds of technology and media, some would  say collide, I might say come together, co-exist, it's a pacific --  cnn.pacific.com to make sure you subscribe.</p><p> Donald Trump is sometimes referred to as the CEO and chief, the real estate  mogul inside scenes derides the surface as he spoke to the press after  meeting North Korean leader. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  We have great beaches.

What if? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  North Korea's made recent efforts to both destroy some industry,  it's improve the airports and hotel options in sea-side city of Wonsan  previously used for missile testing.  </p><p> Joining me is Simon Cockerell, the General Manager of Koryo Tourism,  specializing in leading trips to North Korea.  Just how many people go to  North Korea?</p><p> SIMON COCKERELL, GENERAL MANAGER, KORYO TOURS:  Well, many tens of  thousands actually, the vast majority of them being mainland Chinese  businesses.  Of the non -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> COCKERELL:  Chinese businesses, around 5,000 or so per year as tourists. </p><p> QUEST:  So you're from a low base, you have the potential for a huge  growth.  Are you seeing more interest from people.  Obviously, following  the awfulness of places -- of death of people like Otto Warmbier and the  like. </p><p> There have been other reluctant to even set foot in the place in case  something goes wrong -- </p><p> COCKERELL:  Well -- </p><p> QUEST:  But that could change. </p><p> COCKERELL:  Yes, I mean, actually the numbers were much lower several years  ago, just a few hundred people.  Since around 2012, the numbers have been  fairly steady, four to five and a half thousand people per year.  These are  very low numbers of course. </p><p> The first half of last year was the biggest six months first day in our  industry, and then the second half was very small, thanks -- well, due  largely in part to the Warmbier case that you mentioned, but also the  nuclear tests, missile tests, the whole drama of North Korea. </p><p> The -- you know, the threats and the rhetoric pouring out.  But there's  been a bit of a recovery, but the numbers again are very small, so small  enough that a handful of people can suddenly make it seem like a it's  resurgent.</p><p> So there's room for growth -- </p><p> QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p> COCKERELL:  Only so much actually.</p><p> QUEST:  OK, well, that's because of infrastructure and the like.  And when  Donald Trump, you heard just earlier, you heard him talking about -- I  mean, you can't take the real estate man or the builder out of him, can  you? </p><p> [16:40:00] He took it -- he immediately sees it and immediately wants to  talk, put up condos and beach resorts. </p><p> Is this at all realistic that North Korea could develop some form of  significant tourism industry? </p><p> COCKERELL:  Well, he's a little late to the game on that, because on the  Caramoan Peninsula, opposite the city of Wonsan, the exact area he's  referring to for -- where there are artillery barrage took place not so  long ago.  There's a tourist resort under construction, now a 100-plus  buildings. </p><p> Who it's being built for, nobody is quite sure, probably more domestic  tourists or a kind of aspirational hope that more Chinese tourists and even  South Korean tourists will visit, because the western tourist market, the  market -- my company Koryo Tours has no need for tourist resort of a 100  buildings.</p><p> So it is possible as you said, new international airport has been built,  but so far, after a year, nearly two years of operation, that airport has  received a little of handful of flights.  So it's something for the future  -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> COCKERELL:  Shall we say, not for the near future, maybe. </p><p> QUEST:  And if I was to go for my annual vacation to North Korea, what's  the one thing I must see? </p><p> COCKERELL:  That's a good question.  If it was your first trip to North  Korea, the one thing you should see, I would say would be the capital city  Pyongyang and at least one other place outside.  So most tourists go to the  demilitarized zone, DM Zone or DMZ on a de facto borderline with South  Korea. </p><p> But I just returned from my 170th trip actually last week, and I spent most  of that trip on the east coast, in Wonsan, industrial city -- </p><p> QUEST:  Right -- </p><p> COCKERELL:  Of Hamhung and the diamond mountain area.  So you should get  out of the capital and see not just where the middle class and the consumer  class live, and try and get a sense of a cross-section of society as much  as you can in a very restricted place and in limited time, of course. </p><p> QUEST:  Thank you sir, thank you for joining us.  Now, the experts are  arguing vividly over who was the winner and loser from the Singapore  Summit.  As one group that definitely won, PotCoin.  </p><p> Marijuana cryptocurrency supported Dennis Rodman's trip, it was at numerous  amounts today, 13 percent, 14 percent.

And obviously has great rapport with Kim, who is a  basketball fanatic himself. </p><p> So I think that there's a potential here to engage Dennis Rodman in a  serious way in promoting this relationship. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  Dennis Rodman spoke to CNN during the summit itself, and his  passion for North Korea's future was obvious. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DENNIS RODMAN, FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER:  I talked to Kim Jong-un and an  administration over there five years ago.  And he asked me five years ago,  we sat down for lunch, and he sat down and asked me, hey, Dennis, I'll like  to ask you three things if you go back to tell the president of the United  States these three things and I will be willing to talk to him. </p><p> And this is a true story, and I got my people here that was there that  heard the conversation.  He said things like, if they can move the ships  from South Korea, I would do what I have to do to listen. </p><p> If you can lose certain things, do certain things, I will listen, my ears  will be open.  And I tried to do that to Obama and Obama didn't even give  me the time of day.  I asked him, I said, I have something to say from  North Korea, he just brushed me off. </p><p> But that didn't deter me, I still kept going back, I kept going back, I  kept going back, I showed my loyalty and my trustworthiness to this  country, and I said to everybody, I said the door will open.</p><p> It was amazing, it's amazing when I said those things -- when I said those  damn things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats, I got so  many death threats, so I was sitting up, protecting everything.  And I  believe in North Korea. </p><p> And when I went home, I came into a home, I came into a home after a  hideout for 30 days, I couldn't even go home, but I kept my head up high,  brother, I knew things will change, I knew it, I was the only one, I never  had no one to hear me, I never had no one to see me. </p><p> But I took those voice, I took all that, I took everything, everyone came  at me, but I'm still standing.  It took days, some great days -- now,  everybody say therefore, talking of China, everybody, it's a great day! I'm  here to see it, I'm so happy. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> QUEST:  And with that, we'll take a break. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> JAKE TAPPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We've got breaking news.  A judge has just  ruled on the AT&amp;T and Time Warner merger.  Of course, we need to point out  that CNN is a unit of Time Warner.  CNN's Justice Correspondent, Jessica  Schneider is live for us at the courthouse.  Jessica, what can you tell us? </p><p> JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jake, quite simply,  the judge in this case, the federal district court judge has essentially  approved this merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, AT&amp;T's acquisition of  Time Warner. </p><p> I just got out of the court room, Judge Richard Leon for 30 minutes read  his opinion and at the end of it, he said that basically, the government's  three series of harm, all three series, they did not meet their burden of  proof to show that there will be a substantial lessening of competition if  in fact AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner. </p><p> So again, this was a six-week trial, the judge ruling today that this  merger can in fact go forward.  And beyond that, I mean, this is really a  complete and total wimp AT&amp;T.  And what could happen at this point forward  is that the government after losing in this case, they could ask for a stay  of this opinion as they go for appeal. </p><p> And what's important about that is that could effectively render this deal  dead.  You know, this deal would have to go through by June 21st, that's  the merger deadline that has been set by both AT&amp;T and Time Warner, that at  which point either party, either company can walk away. </p><p> With the end of his ruling here, after the judge said that the government  has failed to prove that the judge should deny this merger.  The judge went  even further than that, and the judge said to the government in very stern  words, think before you go to the appeals process with this. </p><p> Think before you move for a stay here.  He said that AT&amp;T had already  suffered harm in this, given that the government has been working to block  this merger since this -- since the lawsuit in November and since the trial  started in March. </p><p> I just want to -- you know, a bit of the language that the judge gave here.   Again, it was quite stern towards the government.  He said I hope the  senior leadership of government will see how unlikely it will be to get a  stay and how manifestly unfair it will be when deciding whether to seek  this stay. </p><p> So the judge warning the government after the government has lost this case  which the government argued for six weeks here at this federal courthouse,  saying to them, think twice here before you move forward with any motion to  stay, whether you move forward with any plans to appeal. </p><p> Because again, Jake, this merger deadline is just days away on June 21st,  if the deal doesn't go forward by then, either party could walk away from  this.  So that is why the judge had to get this ruling out today to allow  that appeals -- time for appeal. </p><p> So again, Jake, to reiterate, the judge here in this case has effectively  approved this merger to go forward, pending any appeal or motion to stay by  the government.  But again, the judge warning the government think twice  before you do this because the judge says I don't think you have a great  case on appeal.  Jake? </p><p> TAPPER:  All right, Jessica Schneider at the court house for us, I want to  bring in CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.  Jeffrey, on the face of  it, it looks like a setback if not a big defeat for the Trump Justice  Department.  What's your take? </p><p> JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  I would say it's a setback and a big  defeat for the Trump Justice Department.  I mean, this was a scathing and  total rejection of the government's theory that this merger would violate  anti-trust law. </p><p> But we have not yet had access to the 470-page opinion of Judge Leon.  But  you know, he went through each of the government's theories of why this  merger would lessen competition and be bad for consumers.  And in each  case, he rejected the government's contention that this would be a bad  merger for consumers. </p><p> [16:50:00] And then as Jessica told you, a really unusual part of his  opinion was him saying to the government, look, don't even bother appealing  because if you appeal, if you get a stay, you will kill the deal even if  you -- that -- the appeals court ultimately sides with AT&amp;T and Time  Warner. </p><p> That the procedure will take over for the substance.  So he was saying,  look, admit, you lost and let this deal go forward.  You can sue later, he  said to the government to break up the company, but don't try to stop this  merger at this late day. </p><p> That was a very unusual thing that the judge did, and it's basically a sign  of how much he rejected the Trump Justice Department's arguments in this  case.</p><p> TAPPER:  And Jeffrey, let me ask you, President Trump, when he was just  candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, he expressed  opposition to this deal.  Now, on its face, his opposition, his political  oppositions seemed rooted in the fact that he obviously does not like CNN  and Time Warner is our parent company. </p><p> The Justice Department attorney arguing against this merger on anti-trust  grounds.  How much did any of it had to do with President Trump's political  argument and stated anonymous CNN.</p><p> TOOBIN:  You know, you know, Jake, that is in many respects the most  interesting part of the case, and it never appeared in the court room.   Judge Leon, at the very beginning of the case said to both parties, I am  not going to examine the political motivations of the Justice Department.</p><p> I am not going to even let Time Warner look at whether there were  communications between candidate Trump, President Trump and his Justice  Department about this case.  I am not going to allow that to be in the  evidence presented at all.</p><p> So that was not part of the case.  The judge decided this case solely on  the grounds of anti-trust law, not on the motivations of the Justice  Department.  And now, in light of this extremely comprehensive rejection of  the government's theory, certainly, many people will ask, why did they  bring this case at all? Because of candidate Trump's outspoken opposition  to it. </p><p> But in terms of the evidence in the court room, Donald Trump, President  Trump's statements about the merger never played a part. </p><p> TAPPER:  How fascinating, stay there, Jeffrey, I want to bring in CNN  senior media correspondent Brian Stelter.  And Brian, what stands out to  you about this position, about Judge Leon.</p><p> BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is a ruling that  will be heard throughout the business world.  It's a shock that's going to  cause a lot of other reactions.  We're going to see Comcast in the coming  days, go ahead and challenge Disney for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century \"Fox\"  assets.</p><p> We're going to see other mergers and acquisitions now as a result, all  because there was essentially a holding pattern all waiting for this  ruling.  And there were many companies watching on the sidelines, wondering  what the judge will do. </p><p> And now that we have the answer, and the answer is so clear, you know, this  is not a ruling with a lot of conditions as many expected, there are not a  lot of strings attached, it sounds like there are no strings attached, it  is a very clear and comprehensive ruling, so it's a giant thumbs up for the  American business world. </p><p> And that's why beyond just the media industry, it's an important moment for  American business, they be given a thumbs up to go and pursue some more of  these deals.  In terms of our channel and our parent company, we're going  to see AT&amp;T move quickly to try and close this deal now.</p><p> It's been more than 18 months since the deal was struck, since this attempt  to do this acquisition was announced, it's been a very long road, there's  an opportunity of course associated with this, with this trial and with the  long delay. </p><p> And so now AT&amp;T -- unless there's a stay, unless there's an injunction,  unless the government goes in and tries to get that, then we'll see these  two companies come together next week, so just six days from now, CNN will  be owned by AT&amp;T. </p><p> TAPPER:  And let's go back to CNN's Jessica Schneider who is live at the  court house, and Jessica, you have a statement from the lawyer from the  Justice Department -- from the Trump Justice Department about the case.   What does he have to say? </p><p> SCHNEIDER:  Great, Jake, a swift reaction from the Department of Justice  Makan Delrahim; he's the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the  Antitrust division.  He was in the court room today, he was in the court  room throughout this six-week trial, just now issuing a statement here,  I'll read it for you. </p><p> He says \"we are disappointed with the court's decision today.  We continue  to believe that the paid TV market will be less competitive and less  innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. </p><p> We will closely review the court's opinion and consider next steps in light  of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American  consumers.\"  So the Department of Justice there, Makan Delrahim not saying  whether or not the government might seek a stay, might go forward with an  appeal or start something, the judge warns sternly against. </p><p> [16:55:00] And it's interesting that the Department of Justice and its  statement still holding to their argument that this acquisition, this  merger would be anti-competitive especially because the judge just spent 20  minutes in court, knocking down each and every argument line by line, bit  by bit. </p><p> The judge in fact at one point in terms of one of their argument put it  this way, he said neither category of evidence was effective, it was too  speculative in nature, it was contradicted by the government's own  evidence, and at the end he said, this evidence had little to no value.</p><p> But in this statement from the Department of Justice, Jake, Makan Delrahim;  the deputy -- the Antitrust chief seeming to stick by the government's  argument and not giving an indication whether they'll take heed in the  judge's warning not to move forward on the appeal.  Jake. </p><p> TAPPER:  All right, Jessica, thank you so much.  Let me bring back Jeffrey  Toobin, and Jeffrey, obviously, just to remind our viewers, CNN has a  vested interest in this major case because Time Warner is our parent  company.  Putting that aside for a second and putting aside whether or not  this is the right decision by Judge Leon or not. </p><p> Is it consistent with the Trump Justice Department and its attitude towards  business? In other words, does trying to stop this merger make sense  because of the other principles and ideals that the Trump administration  argues for either through the Antitrust division of the Justice Department  or elsewhere.</p><p> TOOBIN:  You know, Jake, that is incredibly important question.  And that  is why there has been so much suspicion about the motives behind the  Justice Department's decision to try to stop this merger.</p><p> Republicans in general, conservatives in general, going back to the days of  Robert Burke(ph) who was sort of the great genius of conservative view of  antitrust law have taken a hands off view towards mergers. </p><p> They basically had a laissez faire approach, the government should stay out  of the business of regulating, of stopping mergers.  What makes people --  what made people so suspicious of the government's motive in this case was  that here you have a Republican Justice Department trying to challenge  after merger. </p><p> Even more unusual was the fact, what this is known as what's called a  vertical merger where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are not competitive.  They are - - Time Warner is a supplier of content to AT&amp;T, vertical mergers like that  are almost never threatened, are never challenged by any Justice  Department, Democrat or Republican. </p><p> The horizontal mergers, when competitors merge, that tends to be when the  government gets involved.  So the fact that this was a Republican  administration challenging a vertical merger suggested perhaps that some  other motives were in play other than simply a neutral application of  antitrust law.</p><p> TAPPER:  I want to bring in Timothy Wu right now.  He's a professor at  Columbia Law School.  Timothy, what's your take on the ruling? </p><p> TIMOTHY WU, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL:  Yes, I mean, I haven't read it  like everyone else, but my suspicion is that it may go so far and the  Justice Department will want to -- want to appeal this. </p><p> You know, they -- a lot of people in the antitrust law have been wanting to  bring back scrutiny of vertical mergers, the idea that the government loses  this case totally seems strong.  They did present a lot of evidence, so I  wouldn't be surprised if Justice does seek the appeal as a -- even despite  the district court judge telling them not to.</p><p> TAPPER:  And what would be the effect of that? Will that have the effect of  freezing the merger, ending the merger, just the act of appealing? </p><p> WU:  It totally depends on what appellate court does, they may not think  it's enough an emergency to stay the merger, they may stay the merger.   Even if the merger is stayed, it doesn't necessarily mean the merger have  to be abandoned. </p><p> But I think it's possible, but because the government thinks these  principles are important enough, that they'll really want to appeal this.</p><p> TAPPER:  Do you think the judge made the wrong decision today? </p><p> WU:  Well, I haven't read the decision and I haven't seen it as much as  they happen to see that.  It sounds like he's gone pretty far, it sounds  like he's stuck to sort of the 1980s, more kind of a Burke(ph) line on  Chicago line on antitrust, no, we never do anything and I think the law has  evolved since then and economic research has evolved, so this decision may  be vulnerable to appeal for those reasons.</p><p> TAPPER:  We only have about 30 seconds left, but as quickly as you can, I  recognize you could probably speak for six hours on it, why would such a  merger be a bad idea. </p><p> WU:  You know, it's just basically the idea that vertical mergers also cost  consumers money, also interfere with competition, and you know, there's  ruling, again, I haven't read it.  But it sounds like the old 1980s,  Reagan's style, nothing vertical is ever a suspect.</p><p> This was a very big vertical merger, and if it's gone too far, the opinion  may be very susceptible to an appeal.</p><p> TAPPER:  All right, professor, thank you so much for your time -- </p><p> WU:  Sure -- </p><p> TAPPER:  I appreciate it.  That's it for \"THE LEAD\" today.  I turn you over  to Wolf Blitzer.  He is in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\" Thanks for watching.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

One, two, three -- there we go, three -- a good gavel, a good man, it's Tuesday, it is the 12th of June.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, judgment is imminent for AT&amp;T and Time Warner. We will know in the next hour if the US judge will allow the merger of these two giants to go through.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Singapore Summit, Donald Trump wants fewer nukes and more condos in North Korea. Is that what they talked about? And the British Prime Minister makes compromises and in doing so gets her Brexit bill further through Parliament. There is so much in the next hour. I am Richard Quest, live in London and yes, I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Busy hour that you and I have together. A day for history books on every continent. We will have full analysis of the Singapore Summit over the course of the program. You are also going to hear from two top chief executives on the British government's Brexit vote which is working its way through the Parliament and we will also have the verdict, the judgment that corporate America has been waiting for.</p><p>Why is the corporate American? An entire media industry, the ramifications from Judge Leon's decision in Time Warner and AT&amp;T will go far and wide across the anti-trust rules. Moments from now, the Judge's decision will reshape media and set the standards for antitrust regulations in the United States.</p><p>Judge Richard Leon will determine whether the $85 billion takeover of our parent company, Time Warner can go forward. Huge implications whichever way you look at it for AT&amp;T which insists it needs the deal to complete and for you and me as viewers as a member of company that control content and distribution shrinks.</p><p>That is the courthouse. The leaders of corporate America deciding whether to go forward with deals of their own. That is the courthouse. As soon as we have the decision, we will bring it to here on \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>So, South Korea's Defense Ministry says, it needs to figure out exactly what President Trump meant when he announced that joint US-South Korean war games will come to an end. The US President was talking to journalists and he spoke for more than an hour after his summit with Kim Jong-un. He called the war games inappropriate and said he wants to bring the 32,000 US troops stationed in South Korea back home.</p><p>The two leaders signed that agreement in which Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his commitment to complete denuclearization and President Trump gave security guarantees to North Korea and said this meeting was just the beginning.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I also will be inviting Chairman Kim at the appropriate time to the White House, I think it is really going to be something that will be very important. And he has accepted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Foreign affairs columnist, Bobby Ghosh joins me now. We can go backwards and forwards on whether it was worth it, what they discussed, did they get all that Kim Jong-un said what he's done before. In a nutshell, though, before we parse it, was it worth it?</p><p>BOBBY GHOSH, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST: Politically, for both players, yes, and in any real terms, probably not. Donald Trump gets to play to his base. He keeps a campaign promise. Kim Jong-un gets to parade on the world stage, gets both of them get an amazing photo opportunity. It gets declared a historic moment just the fact that the two men met at all.</p><p>But then you parse the deal, you look more closely at the papers they signed and you realize there is not a lot there. This is all vague, it's all sort of well-meaning words that don't actually amount to any roadmap that will lead us to where Donald Trump wants to go, which is a denuclearized North Korea or even where North Korea wants to go, which is the full removal of economic sanctions.</p><p>Neither of those two destinations, we don't have roadmaps to either of them at this point.</p><p>QUEST: Right, but we were never going to get full roadmaps from a meeting that was thrown together in three months in such a fashion. And the argument of course is that merely meeting -- I mean, the analysis I have seen suggest, look, merely meeting means that it's much harder now for any form of armed conflict to take place.</p><p>GHOSH: That is if you believe that armed conflict was a likelihood even before this meeting. I personally don't. I don't think there was any scenario in which the United States for one was going to war with a regime that has a million men army --</p><p>[16:05:16]</p><p>GHOSH: -- and nuclear weapons. There was a lot of rhetoric, it was overheated in my opinion, but it was never actually going to lead to war, but that having been said, the fact that the two men have met and have agree to keep talking -- that second piece, that agreed to keep talking themselves and officials below that level, that's probably a good thing.</p><p>Better jaw-jaw than talk of war-war, as Winston Churchill might have said.</p><p>QUEST: Indeed, and the \"New York Times\" puts it this way though, this afternoon, suggesting that actually, what you are really talking about is containment within the existing parameters for North Korea rather than abandonment of nuclear weapons. If that is the case, and again, this is \"The Times,\" this is me, it suggests that really, you're looking at an Iran type of situation where all you're doing is aiming to contain rather than abolish?</p><p>GHOSH: No, actually not as even as good as the Iran deal if we look at it again more closely. The United States is giving security guarantees to the North Koreans, the North Koreans are not giving -- the word \"guarantee\" does not leave Kim Jong-un's lips even once during this entire discussion.</p><p>So, it seems like a very one-sided deal. I would disagree with the \"New York Times\" there. I don't think this is containment. This is enablement in some degree. It basically takes North Korea's nuclear program and leaves it intact for an unspecified number of months, years going forward, at the same time, unilaterally, without consulting with the South Koreans, President Trump announces that there will be no more war games. Those military exercises which were a big part of the containment.</p><p>Keep in mind, for decades, containment has been the only option and those military exercises have been the main instrument, if you like of containment, now that instrument has been taken off the table. Where is the containment?</p><p>QUEST: All right, Bobby, good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>GHOSH: Anytime.</p><p>QUEST: There's plenty for us to talk about that we will keep looking at this as we continue, there is so much. The thing we are watching out for is the decision in the AT&amp;T case -- the AT&amp;T and Time Warner -- parent company of this network -- the Judge any time now, it may even have started reading his judgment. As soon as we get an idea of what that judgment is, whence CNN will be bringing you that decision and the analysis, because it's more than just a case about this company and AT&amp;T, it is antitrust and it promises to change the landscape of corporate America. We will have that in a moment.</p><p>Choppy is the best word to describe Wall Street's changing. Looking at the graph and you'll see what I mean. Although it was predominantly down, having --</p><p>[16:10:16]</p><p>QUEST: -- been off very sharply at around what? Three o'clock in the afternoon, rallies back up again and ekes out just a small loss at 1.58 and I think that that economy shows you more than anything else the nature of the market, the way indeed it rallied. And the NASDAQ closed at a record high, so you have a record -- all the market, the two markets that barely made it -- sure did.</p><p>And if you look at the traveling trading post, it is the 19th record this year. Later in the week of course, when I am back in New York, we will very much look forward to getting back to the trading post and changing the numbers actually for you on the boards.</p><p>Tesla shares ended in the day up. They've been as much as six percent higher after one analyst raised the forecast of deliveries of Model 3. It fell back when Elon Musk confirmed the company will lay off 9 percent of its workforce. Paul La Monica is following it all.</p><p>The stock is still up though some 30 percent or 40 percent since its lows earlier in the year last year, so Musk is doing something right.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I think that investors clearly do believe Elon Musk when he talks and tweets about these ambitious goals for when Model 3's are going to be delivered to consumers and start hitting the streets. Of course, the problem that Tesla has faced is that, they have been going for a lot of cash, and they have been losing money and unfortunately, for workers that is going to mean that there will be some layoffs and I think, you know, the sad reality is that Tesla bulls will probably applaud this because it may finally show some financial discipline from Elon Musk which isn't something that I think is always associated with him.</p><p>QUEST: Right, so the first point of course is, will they meet their however many thousand, I think it was 5,000 or whatever Model 3's that they are expecting to produce. They are getting close to it with 3, 000 to 3,500, to 4,000 -- so that's the first issue.</p><p>But then of course, there is the ramp up of production over the whole model range and the trucks and all the other things. Is there a feeling that Tesla has pardoned upon, turned the corner?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think that the key question is does Tesla have the financial resources to do everything that Musk ambitiously wants to do. As you pointed out, Richard, there is the Model 3. There is the Model S and Model X of course, and then there is the semi-trucks and then they are also still integrating Solar City, which is going to be building solar roof panels on homes and other buildings. Musk has a lot on his plate just at Tesla.</p><p>Then you have SpaceX, you have the Boring Company, you have all of these tweets that he is lashing out against the media. He is a very busy guy and I think it's a question of whether or not he can accomplish everything that he is setting out to do because he is just one person and last I checked, cloning was not one of the many things that Musk is working on.</p><p>QUEST: No, Paul, you and I have argued and discussed this before. I am in the camp that says the guy is a visionary. Yes, he may be a bit weird and bizarre occasionally, but he has done more in a short period of time than most Chief Execs do in their entire life.</p><p>LA MONICA: Oh, I am not by any -- you know, I am not at all trying to say that Elon Musk should be criticized for having the great visionary ideas that he has, but there is a difference between doing what he does and saying that you're going to do something and being able to actually accomplish it.</p><p>And, you know, also, I don't remember Steve Jobs and other visionary repeatedly bashing the media the way Musk does as well. So, from a self- serving standpoint, it's a little frustrating that Elon Musk lash out at us all the time.</p><p>QUEST: Care to take a punt on what Judge Leon is going to decide.</p><p>LA MONICA: I am not going there at all. We are going to find out very soon, so I will punt on taking a punt.</p><p>QUEST: All right, but I think you'd agree whichever way it goes, I was just thinking about this. Whichever way it goes, the landscape for antitrust and corporate America, never mind just the media industry, shifts, if he decides in favor of AT&amp;T-Time Warner, then the vertical rules change.</p><p>If he decides in favor of the Justice Department, then they most certainly change. So, whichever way this goes, what do you think?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I think it is safe to say that if Judge Leon rules in of AT&amp;T and Time Warner and doesn't put may condition on the deal. There likely will be other media mergers coming and the other thing I think, Richard is if this deal does go through, I can tell my mother, \"I work for the phone company,\" and she might finally have some understanding of what I do for a living.</p><p>QUEST: She might finally say, \"You've got an honest job.\" You've got an honest job and you're working for a real company, and you might know that nonsense on the media. All right, Paul La Monica, Guru La Monica.</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you, sir.</p><p>QUEST: There is an ace to stop the rebellion --</p><p>[16:15:16]</p><p>QUEST: -- by comprising with the MPs who wanted the final say on Brexit. Now, some of the main supporters had wanted a more definitive say if they disagreed on the Brexit deal. It would have undermined the Prime Minister's negotiating ability in the long run. That's according to the Brexit Minister.</p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID DAVIES, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE: The government cannot demonstrate the flexibility necessary for successful negotiation if its hands are tied midway through the process. That will do nothing but guarantee a bad deal for Britain.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: It was the key vote on a string of amendments that was proposed by the Upper House of Lords. A former Justice Minister has resigned ahead of the vote saying that Brexit is detrimental to business. Now, the Minister -- the former Minister Phillip Lee said, \"In extensive consultations with local employers -- large and small -- I have been warned that they expect Brexit, as it is currently being pursued would have a negotiated settlement will damage their business.\"</p><p>This shows the febrile nature of the British tabloids where absolutely, unequivocal about the role of Parliament that it has to say Brexit. If you look at the \"Daily Express,\" \"Ignore the will of the people at your peril,\" and \"The Sun\" delivered a warning to MP's, \"Great Britain or Great Betrayal.\" Now, you can't necessarily see this here, but if you noticed, on the cover, it is peppered with British icons.</p><p>You've got the Angel of the North in Northern England, you've got the mini car, you've got the red bus and of course, you've got the red arrows and you've got a spit fire. You could see more on the picture there.</p><p>Tim Martin is the Founder and Chairman of JD Wetherspoon, a branded hotel chain, he joins me now. I think I am not doing you a disservice when I say you are an ardent Brexiteer.</p><p>TIM MARTIN, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JD WETHERSPOON: I have been called out, Richard, and I won't argue, you're right.</p><p>QUEST: All right, and so you have a plan, you have a policy. You have an idea of what you think this should look like afterwards. You can't be pleased with the way it is going at the moment.</p><p>MARTIN: I think it's turning into a bit of a dog's dinner. I think that the government should approach the negotiations in another way. The EU is a protectionist system. It charges tariffs. We could have made food and everything else cheaper in the shops. We have eliminated the tariffs and just left the EU and instead of paying them 39 billion, we could have allocated that money to UK consumers, so you wouldn't have had -- we could have regained control of our fishing.</p><p>If you'd done those three things, you wouldn't have been reliant on the EU. We would be better off now and I think we would be better off than if we had a deal.</p><p>QUEST: But you couldn't not pay the exit bill. I mean, in the sense that that would be reneging on previously agreed expenditure that the UK signed up for.</p><p>MARTIN: Well, I understand that the legal advice on that is there is no legal obligation to pay it and certainly, and certainly, no one has turned around and explained to the British public or even the media exactly on what basis there is some sort of obligation to pay that. I think we are paying it to try and persuade them to do a free trade deal.</p><p>QUEST: Would you be in favor more of a -- as the FT put in this morning, the Donald Trump approach? Tell them where to go, tell them where to stick it and if they don't like it, end of subject?</p><p>MARTIN: Well, the trouble with Donald Trump is he is a divisive character. I would go for the approach of saying, we want to be friends with you in the EU, you are very good suppliers. You are nice people, but we aren't dependent on a deal with you. This is what we are going to (inaudible) --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But we are -- this is the problem here. Every business person I speak to says that if we crash out of the EU, then the effect will be devastating on the British government.</p><p>MARTIN: That is a complete fallacy and it is just politics transferred into the minds of the Board rooms who have argued that if we leave the EU, its protectionist system, prices in the shops go down plus, we don't have to pay them $10 billion a year, plus, we regain control of our fishing market, plus we --</p><p>QUEST: But every company that does business across the channel will suddenly be faced with a level of complexity that they don't currently employ. It would crash out.</p><p>MARTIN: No, because you abolish tariffs for the rest of the world, America for example, no tariffs and that means no tariffs from the EU. So you would be in a better position. The main thing to understand is the EU is 7 percent of the world, it is a protectionist system, it has tariffs for the other 93 percent -- abolish it, get out of the EU, you're trading with 93 percent of the world. We will get our prices down and our pubs tomorrow for food and drink, if we leave the EU and the customs union, a lot of people in Britain just don't understand that, but that is the truth.</p><p>QUEST: But if you're told as we are that 40 percent of the exports do go to the --</p><p>[16:20:15]</p><p>QUEST: -- and it's more, it's about 50 percent to 55 percent, do go to the EU, they will be tariff-ed immediately by the other side, and even if they are not tariff-ed, there will be a complexity to doing this. Let's forget about Northern Ireland there, that's entirely different. Let's just talk about on the back burner at the moment. There would be a difficulty in just saying goodbye, turn the lights off.</p><p>MARTIN: None at all. We trade with the EU. We buy champagne, we buy wine et cetera, we can switch tomorrow and eliminate all trade with the EU if you want to and get wine from America, from the new world, Australia et cetera, from South America, and it's not going to make an iota of difference.</p><p>It will force the EU to become more competitive. At the moment, we sell -- the top selling house wine is from Australia and New Zealand and it has got a tariff, so why should our customers pay tariff to Brussels?</p><p>QUEST: Now, one thing that is clear, the EU has fought harder to maintain the integrity of the single market. Now, they always said they would, but the British people were told by Brexiteers, not you particularly, but by others they were told when push comes to shove, when the crunch time happens, the EU will cave so far -- but that does not appear to be the case.</p><p>MARTIN: They will cave in five minutes flat if we say we are going to leave without a deal. We are going to abolish all tariffs and if you dare charge us tariffs, watch your BMW sales and your champagne sales, we are the second biggest market for both those products, I think in the whole world, go to zero.</p><p>QUEST: And they are prepared to accept that. Someone is saying -- someone said that is the price that Merkel will tell her people, \"That's the price we are going to pay.\"</p><p>MARTIN: I am going to have to swear in television --</p><p>QUEST: No, you're not.</p><p>MARTIN: But no, you're wrong. You're wrong.</p><p>QUEST: Tim, it is always good to have you. I noticed, there's been a lot of talk about champagne, a lot of talk about all of these things and there is no evidence of it in front of us.</p><p>MARTIN: I am disappointed.</p><p>QUEST: You're the hotelier and hospitality, man, you should be -- good to see you, Tim.</p><p>MARTIN: Thanks a lot.</p><p>QUEST: As always. European markets have ended the day mixed. The FTSE 100 closed down by 0.42 percent followed by the CAC 40 in France.</p><p>Japan is transforming mobility for those who struggle to get around, and that includes those with disabilities or the elderly. In \"Business Frontier,\" Anna Stewart looks at how tech is making their lives easier including wheelchairs on demand.</p><p>(START VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Approximately 15 percent of the world's population has some form of disability according to the World Health Organization.

Japan has limited space in public facilities like this market. So, wheelchairs need to be agile. When I was using an ordinary wheelchair, I used to check on Google Maps to look for obstacles in the streets that might block my mobility.</p><p>Now, I can go over most of that, so I do not need to prepare in advance.</p><p>STEWART: That's because Whill uses the omni wheel, a normal wheel surrounded by many separate tires which all rotate.

Come 2020, we would like to make this kind of mobility available not only at airports, but also in towns and stadiums.

But here we are.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Now, the analysts believe a decision will trigger a domino effect across corporate America once it takes place. So keep the AT&amp;T domino towards, yes, are more likely than Comcast will fight for 21st Century Fox and that's been of course against Disney, that's a huge bid in its own right, another global bid.</p><p>It could then bolden CVS; the drugstore trying to buy Aetna, another vertical, and that's a deal worth $69 billion. And then you got the smaller media companies than AT -- no, taking on the giants. Now, that's the new -- that way.</p><p>But tip the dominos towards no deal or Time Warner may break up, you can see the selloff of Turner, which is our parent and CNN, which is part of Turner. It would show the Justice Department is taking an activist role for AT&amp;T on competition grounds.</p><p>The trouble for mergers between Sprint and mobile would also -- T-Mobile would also be absolutely in trouble, all of which if the Justice Department prevails in this case. And when you put it all together and you see all the various different manifestations and the dominos that can fall, you realize that it all hinges on one little tip of the domino.</p><p>It all starts with one little push. Dylan Byers is CNNMoney's senior reporter for media and politics and joins me now. Which way -- oh, you don't have, you can plead the Fifth on this.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNNMONEY SENIOR REPORTER FOR MEDIA &amp; POLITICS: What I will say is you can't sort of read the tea leaves here in the fact that the judge has invited the media back to hear his ruling which he's going to read out loud.</p><p>Usually in a case like this, you just have a written ruling because there's a simple decision one way or the other and then the dominos fall as you showed one way or the other. So what that says to me is that he's going to have a complex ruling -- it's very likely and I think this is the conventional wisdom right now among analysts and the media, that he will approve the deal, but he will approve the deal with certain conditions.</p><p>Now, that's just a conventional wisdom, anything could happen here. The fact that this even went to trial and took 500-plus days was not something I think that AT&amp;T and Time Warner anticipated. So, we're on pins and needles here waiting to see what happens.</p><p>And like you said, the ramifications for the industry are enormous.</p><p>QUEST: All right, the way in which it moves forward. So for example, if AT&amp;T loses, if -- and Time Warner lose, does that transaction fall apart because the deadline is next week to complete the deal, and after that deadline, either side can if they wanted to get out.</p><p>And what we hear of course is, there are some who are saying, since the fall in AT&amp;T share price, actually Time Warner would be wise to look elsewhere.</p><p>BYERS: Well, look, I do think it would be a major blow to have the judge rule against the deal. I think what happens after that, look, there's always the possibility of appeal, there are various ways this can go. But yes, it would conceivably, it would put Time Warner back on the market.</p><p>And then the question which she poses, do you then break up the Time Warner assets, all of a sudden are things like \"Hbo\", Turner, CNN, are they looking for buyers elsewhere? But you know, the -- part of the issue here with the judge's ruling is what's really in question is what right do telecom companies and tech companies have to buy a media acquisition?</p><p>[16:35:00] And if you say no to that, you put a freeze on potential M&amp;A across the board, at least, you know, conceivably through the rest of the Trump administration. If you say yes to that, you open up the flood gates of mergers and acquisitions and media that may ultimately result -- you know, you look now, we've got really about across the tech, media and telecom space, about 16 big companies.</p><p>Ten years from now if this deal goes through, all of a sudden, you could have half that money. And you could really be talking about a future where all media is owned by technology companies and telecom companies and is becoming increasingly hard to really understand the difference between those players since they are all playing in the content game, and they are trying at least to bring that content direct to consumers without any middle men.</p><p>QUEST: The judge knows his stuff, doesn't he? I mean, here's one of the experts in not only anti-trust, but also having done the Comcast-NBC case, so in many ways would be regarded as the right -- the right judge on the right case.</p><p>BYERS: He is and there's been a lot of -- there's been a lot of cloud around this decision, about sort of, you know, was there any political influence here from President Trump in terms --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>BYERS: Blocking this deal, even because CNN, our network was involved. At the end of the day, this is coming down to a judge who like you said has a great deal of experience, who to the best of our knowledge adheres very close to the letter of the law and will make a decision based off of not the considerations of executives or --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>BYERS: Politicians, but of the considerations of the consumer. And that is that, at the end of the day is all you can hope for.</p><p>QUEST: Haven't you got a newsletter to go and write?</p><p>BYERS: I do, I actually do, get sort of benign for the start on tomorrow's newsletter.</p><p>QUEST: Then let me stop you because there's a newsletter, we'll have a lot more on this once we have the decision. Thanks Dylan, it's called --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BYERS: Thank you --</p><p>QUEST: It looks as -- well, the worlds of technology and media, some would say collide, I might say come together, co-exist, it's a pacific -- cnn.pacific.com to make sure you subscribe.</p><p>Donald Trump is sometimes referred to as the CEO and chief, the real estate mogul inside scenes derides the surface as he spoke to the press after meeting North Korean leader.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We have great beaches. You see that, whenever they're exploding their canons into the ocean, I said, boy, look at the view, wouldn't that make a great condo view.</p><p>And I explained, I said, you know, instead of doing that, you could have the best hotels in the world right there. Think of it from a real estate perspective.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: It's hard to even go further with this one. And the president even brought a Hollywood-style four minute trailer to the summit, strengthening his pitch, look at this short clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A new world can begin today, one of friendship, respect and good will. Be part of that world where the doors of opportunity are ready to be opened, investment from around the world where you can have medical breakthroughs and abundance of resources, innovative technology and new discoveries. What if?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: North Korea's made recent efforts to both destroy some industry, it's improve the airports and hotel options in sea-side city of Wonsan previously used for missile testing.</p><p>Joining me is Simon Cockerell, the General Manager of Koryo Tourism, specializing in leading trips to North Korea. Just how many people go to North Korea?</p><p>SIMON COCKERELL, GENERAL MANAGER, KORYO TOURS: Well, many tens of thousands actually, the vast majority of them being mainland Chinese businesses. Of the non --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>COCKERELL: Chinese businesses, around 5,000 or so per year as tourists.</p><p>QUEST: So you're from a low base, you have the potential for a huge growth. Are you seeing more interest from people. Obviously, following the awfulness of places -- of death of people like Otto Warmbier and the like.</p><p>There have been other reluctant to even set foot in the place in case something goes wrong --</p><p>COCKERELL: Well --</p><p>QUEST: But that could change.</p><p>COCKERELL: Yes, I mean, actually the numbers were much lower several years ago, just a few hundred people. Since around 2012, the numbers have been fairly steady, four to five and a half thousand people per year. These are very low numbers of course.</p><p>The first half of last year was the biggest six months first day in our industry, and then the second half was very small, thanks -- well, due largely in part to the Warmbier case that you mentioned, but also the nuclear tests, missile tests, the whole drama of North Korea.</p><p>The -- you know, the threats and the rhetoric pouring out. But there's been a bit of a recovery, but the numbers again are very small, so small enough that a handful of people can suddenly make it seem like a it's resurgent.</p><p>So there's room for growth --</p><p>QUEST: Yes --</p><p>COCKERELL: Only so much actually.</p><p>QUEST: OK, well, that's because of infrastructure and the like. And when Donald Trump, you heard just earlier, you heard him talking about -- I mean, you can't take the real estate man or the builder out of him, can you?</p><p>[16:40:00] He took it -- he immediately sees it and immediately wants to talk, put up condos and beach resorts.</p><p>Is this at all realistic that North Korea could develop some form of significant tourism industry?</p><p>COCKERELL: Well, he's a little late to the game on that, because on the Caramoan Peninsula, opposite the city of Wonsan, the exact area he's referring to for -- where there are artillery barrage took place not so long ago. There's a tourist resort under construction, now a 100-plus buildings.</p><p>Who it's being built for, nobody is quite sure, probably more domestic tourists or a kind of aspirational hope that more Chinese tourists and even South Korean tourists will visit, because the western tourist market, the market -- my company Koryo Tours has no need for tourist resort of a 100 buildings.</p><p>So it is possible as you said, new international airport has been built, but so far, after a year, nearly two years of operation, that airport has received a little of handful of flights. So it's something for the future --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>COCKERELL: Shall we say, not for the near future, maybe.</p><p>QUEST: And if I was to go for my annual vacation to North Korea, what's the one thing I must see?</p><p>COCKERELL: That's a good question. If it was your first trip to North Korea, the one thing you should see, I would say would be the capital city Pyongyang and at least one other place outside. So most tourists go to the demilitarized zone, DM Zone or DMZ on a de facto borderline with South Korea.</p><p>But I just returned from my 170th trip actually last week, and I spent most of that trip on the east coast, in Wonsan, industrial city --</p><p>QUEST: Right --</p><p>COCKERELL: Of Hamhung and the diamond mountain area. So you should get out of the capital and see not just where the middle class and the consumer class live, and try and get a sense of a cross-section of society as much as you can in a very restricted place and in limited time, of course.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you sir, thank you for joining us. Now, the experts are arguing vividly over who was the winner and loser from the Singapore Summit.

And obviously has great rapport with Kim, who is a basketball fanatic himself.</p><p>So I think that there's a potential here to engage Dennis Rodman in a serious way in promoting this relationship.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Dennis Rodman spoke to CNN during the summit itself, and his passion for North Korea's future was obvious.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DENNIS RODMAN, FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER: I talked to Kim Jong-un and an administration over there five years ago. And he asked me five years ago, we sat down for lunch, and he sat down and asked me, hey, Dennis, I'll like to ask you three things if you go back to tell the president of the United States these three things and I will be willing to talk to him.</p><p>And this is a true story, and I got my people here that was there that heard the conversation. He said things like, if they can move the ships from South Korea, I would do what I have to do to listen.</p><p>If you can lose certain things, do certain things, I will listen, my ears will be open. And I tried to do that to Obama and Obama didn't even give me the time of day. I asked him, I said, I have something to say from North Korea, he just brushed me off.</p><p>But that didn't deter me, I still kept going back, I kept going back, I kept going back, I showed my loyalty and my trustworthiness to this country, and I said to everybody, I said the door will open.</p><p>It was amazing, it's amazing when I said those things -- when I said those damn things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats, I got so many death threats, so I was sitting up, protecting everything. And I believe in North Korea.</p><p>And when I went home, I came into a home, I came into a home after a hideout for 30 days, I couldn't even go home, but I kept my head up high, brother, I knew things will change, I knew it, I was the only one, I never had no one to hear me, I never had no one to see me.</p><p>But I took those voice, I took all that, I took everything, everyone came at me, but I'm still standing. It took days, some great days -- now, everybody say therefore, talking of China, everybody, it's a great day! I'm here to see it, I'm so happy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: And with that, we'll take a break.</p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: We've got breaking news. A judge has just ruled on the AT&amp;T and Time Warner merger. Of course, we need to point out that CNN is a unit of Time Warner. CNN's Justice Correspondent, Jessica Schneider is live for us at the courthouse. Jessica, what can you tell us?</p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Well, Jake, quite simply, the judge in this case, the federal district court judge has essentially approved this merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, AT&amp;T's acquisition of Time Warner.</p><p>I just got out of the court room, Judge Richard Leon for 30 minutes read his opinion and at the end of it, he said that basically, the government's three series of harm, all three series, they did not meet their burden of proof to show that there will be a substantial lessening of competition if in fact AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner.</p><p>So again, this was a six-week trial, the judge ruling today that this merger can in fact go forward. And beyond that, I mean, this is really a complete and total wimp AT&amp;T. And what could happen at this point forward is that the government after losing in this case, they could ask for a stay of this opinion as they go for appeal.</p><p>And what's important about that is that could effectively render this deal dead. You know, this deal would have to go through by June 21st, that's the merger deadline that has been set by both AT&amp;T and Time Warner, that at which point either party, either company can walk away.</p><p>With the end of his ruling here, after the judge said that the government has failed to prove that the judge should deny this merger. The judge went even further than that, and the judge said to the government in very stern words, think before you go to the appeals process with this.</p><p>Think before you move for a stay here. He said that AT&amp;T had already suffered harm in this, given that the government has been working to block this merger since this -- since the lawsuit in November and since the trial started in March.</p><p>I just want to -- you know, a bit of the language that the judge gave here. Again, it was quite stern towards the government. He said I hope the senior leadership of government will see how unlikely it will be to get a stay and how manifestly unfair it will be when deciding whether to seek this stay.</p><p>So the judge warning the government after the government has lost this case which the government argued for six weeks here at this federal courthouse, saying to them, think twice here before you move forward with any motion to stay, whether you move forward with any plans to appeal.</p><p>Because again, Jake, this merger deadline is just days away on June 21st, if the deal doesn't go forward by then, either party could walk away from this. So that is why the judge had to get this ruling out today to allow that appeals -- time for appeal.</p><p>So again, Jake, to reiterate, the judge here in this case has effectively approved this merger to go forward, pending any appeal or motion to stay by the government. But again, the judge warning the government think twice before you do this because the judge says I don't think you have a great case on appeal. Jake?</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Jessica Schneider at the court house for us, I want to bring in CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. Jeffrey, on the face of it, it looks like a setback if not a big defeat for the Trump Justice Department. What's your take?</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: I would say it's a setback and a big defeat for the Trump Justice Department. I mean, this was a scathing and total rejection of the government's theory that this merger would violate anti-trust law.</p><p>But we have not yet had access to the 470-page opinion of Judge Leon. But you know, he went through each of the government's theories of why this merger would lessen competition and be bad for consumers. And in each case, he rejected the government's contention that this would be a bad merger for consumers.</p><p>[16:50:00] And then as Jessica told you, a really unusual part of his opinion was him saying to the government, look, don't even bother appealing because if you appeal, if you get a stay, you will kill the deal even if you -- that -- the appeals court ultimately sides with AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p><p>That the procedure will take over for the substance. So he was saying, look, admit, you lost and let this deal go forward. You can sue later, he said to the government to break up the company, but don't try to stop this merger at this late day.</p><p>That was a very unusual thing that the judge did, and it's basically a sign of how much he rejected the Trump Justice Department's arguments in this case.</p><p>TAPPER: And Jeffrey, let me ask you, President Trump, when he was just candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, he expressed opposition to this deal. Now, on its face, his opposition, his political oppositions seemed rooted in the fact that he obviously does not like CNN and Time Warner is our parent company.</p><p>The Justice Department attorney arguing against this merger on anti-trust grounds. How much did any of it had to do with President Trump's political argument and stated anonymous CNN.</p><p>TOOBIN: You know, you know, Jake, that is in many respects the most interesting part of the case, and it never appeared in the court room. Judge Leon, at the very beginning of the case said to both parties, I am not going to examine the political motivations of the Justice Department.</p><p>I am not going to even let Time Warner look at whether there were communications between candidate Trump, President Trump and his Justice Department about this case. I am not going to allow that to be in the evidence presented at all.</p><p>So that was not part of the case. The judge decided this case solely on the grounds of anti-trust law, not on the motivations of the Justice Department. And now, in light of this extremely comprehensive rejection of the government's theory, certainly, many people will ask, why did they bring this case at all? Because of candidate Trump's outspoken opposition to it.</p><p>But in terms of the evidence in the court room, Donald Trump, President Trump's statements about the merger never played a part.</p><p>TAPPER: How fascinating, stay there, Jeffrey, I want to bring in CNN senior media correspondent Brian Stelter. And Brian, what stands out to you about this position, about Judge Leon.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is a ruling that will be heard throughout the business world. It's a shock that's going to cause a lot of other reactions. We're going to see Comcast in the coming days, go ahead and challenge Disney for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century \"Fox\" assets.</p><p>We're going to see other mergers and acquisitions now as a result, all because there was essentially a holding pattern all waiting for this ruling. And there were many companies watching on the sidelines, wondering what the judge will do.</p><p>And now that we have the answer, and the answer is so clear, you know, this is not a ruling with a lot of conditions as many expected, there are not a lot of strings attached, it sounds like there are no strings attached, it is a very clear and comprehensive ruling, so it's a giant thumbs up for the American business world.</p><p>And that's why beyond just the media industry, it's an important moment for American business, they be given a thumbs up to go and pursue some more of these deals. In terms of our channel and our parent company, we're going to see AT&amp;T move quickly to try and close this deal now.</p><p>It's been more than 18 months since the deal was struck, since this attempt to do this acquisition was announced, it's been a very long road, there's an opportunity of course associated with this, with this trial and with the long delay.</p><p>And so now AT&amp;T -- unless there's a stay, unless there's an injunction, unless the government goes in and tries to get that, then we'll see these two companies come together next week, so just six days from now, CNN will be owned by AT&amp;T.</p><p>TAPPER: And let's go back to CNN's Jessica Schneider who is live at the court house, and Jessica, you have a statement from the lawyer from the Justice Department -- from the Trump Justice Department about the case. What does he have to say?</p><p>SCHNEIDER: Great, Jake, a swift reaction from the Department of Justice Makan Delrahim; he's the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust division. He was in the court room today, he was in the court room throughout this six-week trial, just now issuing a statement here, I'll read it for you.</p><p>He says \"we are disappointed with the court's decision today. We continue to believe that the paid TV market will be less competitive and less innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner.</p><p>We will closely review the court's opinion and consider next steps in light of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American consumers.\" So the Department of Justice there, Makan Delrahim not saying whether or not the government might seek a stay, might go forward with an appeal or start something, the judge warns sternly against.</p><p>[16:55:00] And it's interesting that the Department of Justice and its statement still holding to their argument that this acquisition, this merger would be anti-competitive especially because the judge just spent 20 minutes in court, knocking down each and every argument line by line, bit by bit.</p><p>The judge in fact at one point in terms of one of their argument put it this way, he said neither category of evidence was effective, it was too speculative in nature, it was contradicted by the government's own evidence, and at the end he said, this evidence had little to no value.</p><p>But in this statement from the Department of Justice, Jake, Makan Delrahim; the deputy -- the Antitrust chief seeming to stick by the government's argument and not giving an indication whether they'll take heed in the judge's warning not to move forward on the appeal. Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, Jessica, thank you so much. Let me bring back Jeffrey Toobin, and Jeffrey, obviously, just to remind our viewers, CNN has a vested interest in this major case because Time Warner is our parent company. Putting that aside for a second and putting aside whether or not this is the right decision by Judge Leon or not.</p><p>Is it consistent with the Trump Justice Department and its attitude towards business? In other words, does trying to stop this merger make sense because of the other principles and ideals that the Trump administration argues for either through the Antitrust division of the Justice Department or elsewhere.</p><p>TOOBIN: You know, Jake, that is incredibly important question. And that is why there has been so much suspicion about the motives behind the Justice Department's decision to try to stop this merger.</p><p>Republicans in general, conservatives in general, going back to the days of Robert Burke(ph) who was sort of the great genius of conservative view of antitrust law have taken a hands off view towards mergers.</p><p>They basically had a laissez faire approach, the government should stay out of the business of regulating, of stopping mergers. What makes people -- what made people so suspicious of the government's motive in this case was that here you have a Republican Justice Department trying to challenge after merger.</p><p>Even more unusual was the fact, what this is known as what's called a vertical merger where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are not competitive. They are - - Time Warner is a supplier of content to AT&amp;T, vertical mergers like that are almost never threatened, are never challenged by any Justice Department, Democrat or Republican.</p><p>The horizontal mergers, when competitors merge, that tends to be when the government gets involved. So the fact that this was a Republican administration challenging a vertical merger suggested perhaps that some other motives were in play other than simply a neutral application of antitrust law.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Timothy Wu right now. He's a professor at Columbia Law School. Timothy, what's your take on the ruling?</p><p>TIMOTHY WU, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL: Yes, I mean, I haven't read it like everyone else, but my suspicion is that it may go so far and the Justice Department will want to -- want to appeal this.</p><p>You know, they -- a lot of people in the antitrust law have been wanting to bring back scrutiny of vertical mergers, the idea that the government loses this case totally seems strong. They did present a lot of evidence, so I wouldn't be surprised if Justice does seek the appeal as a -- even despite the district court judge telling them not to.</p><p>TAPPER: And what would be the effect of that? Will that have the effect of freezing the merger, ending the merger, just the act of appealing?</p><p>WU: It totally depends on what appellate court does, they may not think it's enough an emergency to stay the merger, they may stay the merger. Even if the merger is stayed, it doesn't necessarily mean the merger have to be abandoned.</p><p>But I think it's possible, but because the government thinks these principles are important enough, that they'll really want to appeal this.</p><p>TAPPER: Do you think the judge made the wrong decision today?</p><p>WU: Well, I haven't read the decision and I haven't seen it as much as they happen to see that. It sounds like he's gone pretty far, it sounds like he's stuck to sort of the 1980s, more kind of a Burke(ph) line on Chicago line on antitrust, no, we never do anything and I think the law has evolved since then and economic research has evolved, so this decision may be vulnerable to appeal for those reasons.</p><p>TAPPER: We only have about 30 seconds left, but as quickly as you can, I recognize you could probably speak for six hours on it, why would such a merger be a bad idea.</p><p>WU: You know, it's just basically the idea that vertical mergers also cost consumers money, also interfere with competition, and you know, there's ruling, again, I haven't read it. But it sounds like the old 1980s, Reagan's style, nothing vertical is ever a suspect.</p><p>This was a very big vertical merger, and if it's gone too far, the opinion may be very susceptible to an appeal.</p><p>TAPPER: All right, professor, thank you so much for your time --</p><p>WU: Sure --</p><p>TAPPER: I appreciate it. That's it for \"THE LEAD\" today. I turn you over to Wolf Blitzer. He is in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\" Thanks for watching.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018061201cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJC-71S1-JB20-G552-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9016\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 12, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS517311 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS511140 DIRECTORY &amp;

One, two, three -- there we go, three -- a good gavel, a good man, it's  Tuesday, it is the 12th of June.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, judgment is imminent for AT&amp;T and Time Warner.  We will know in  the next hour if the US judge will allow the merger of these two giants to  go through.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Singapore Summit, Donald Trump wants fewer nukes and more condos in  North Korea.  Is that what they talked about?  And the British Prime  Minister makes compromises and in doing so gets her Brexit bill further  through Parliament.  There is so much in the next hour.  I am Richard  Quest, live in London and yes, I mean business.  </p><p>Good evening.  Busy hour that you and I have together.  A day for history  books on every continent.  We will have full analysis of the Singapore  Summit over the course of the program.  You are also going to hear from two  top chief executives on the British government's Brexit vote which is  working its way through the Parliament and we will also have the verdict,  the judgment that corporate America has been waiting for.  </p><p>Why is the corporate American?  An entire media industry, the ramifications  from Judge Leon's decision in Time Warner and AT&amp;T will go far and wide  across the anti-trust rules.  Moments from now, the Judge's decision will  reshape media and set the standards for antitrust regulations in the United  States.  </p><p>Judge Richard Leon will determine whether the $85 billion takeover of our  parent company, Time Warner can go forward.  Huge implications whichever  way you look at it for AT&amp;T which insists it needs the deal to complete and  for you and me as viewers as a member of company that control content and  distribution shrinks.  </p><p>That is the courthouse.  The leaders of corporate America deciding whether  to go forward with deals of their own.  That is the courthouse.  As soon as  we have the decision, we will bring it to here on \"Quest Means Business.\"  </p><p>So, South Korea's Defense Ministry says, it needs to figure out exactly  what President Trump meant when he announced that joint US-South Korean war  games will come to an end.  The US President was talking to journalists and  he spoke for more than an hour after his summit with Kim Jong-un.  He  called the war games inappropriate and said he wants to bring the 32,000 US  troops stationed in South Korea back home.  </p><p>The two leaders signed that agreement in which Kim Jong-un reaffirmed his  commitment to complete denuclearization and President Trump gave security  guarantees to North Korea and said this meeting was just the beginning.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I also will be inviting  Chairman Kim at the appropriate time to the White House, I think it is  really going to be something that will be very important.  And he has  accepted.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  Foreign affairs columnist, Bobby Ghosh joins me now.  We can go  backwards and forwards on whether it was worth it, what they discussed, did  they get all that Kim Jong-un said what he's done before.  In a nutshell,  though, before we parse it, was it worth it?  </p><p>BOBBY GHOSH, FOREIGN AFFAIRS COLUMNIST:  Politically, for both players,  yes, and in any real terms, probably not.  Donald Trump gets to play to his  base.  He keeps a campaign promise.  Kim Jong-un gets to parade on the  world stage, gets both of them get an amazing photo opportunity.  It gets  declared a historic moment just the fact that the two men met at all.  </p><p>But then you parse the deal, you look more closely at the papers they  signed and you realize there is not a lot there.  This is all vague, it's  all sort of well-meaning words that don't actually amount to any roadmap  that will lead us to where Donald Trump wants to go, which is a  denuclearized North Korea or even where North Korea wants to go, which is  the full removal of economic sanctions.  </p><p>Neither of those two destinations, we don't have roadmaps to either of them  at this point.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, but we were never going to get full roadmaps from a meeting  that was thrown together in three months in such a fashion.  And the  argument of course is that merely meeting -- I mean, the analysis I have  seen suggest, look, merely meeting means that it's much harder now for any  form of armed conflict to take place.  </p><p>GHOSH:  That is if you believe that armed conflict was a likelihood even  before this meeting.  I personally don't.  I don't think there was any  scenario in which the United States for one was going to war with a regime  that has a million men army --  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>GHOSH:   -- and nuclear weapons.  There was a lot of rhetoric, it was  overheated in my opinion, but it was never actually going to lead to war,  but that having been said, the fact that the two men have met and have  agree to keep talking -- that second piece, that agreed to keep talking  themselves and officials below that level, that's probably a good thing.  </p><p>Better jaw-jaw than talk of war-war, as Winston Churchill might have said.  </p><p>QUEST:  Indeed, and the \"New York Times\" puts it this way though, this  afternoon, suggesting that actually, what you are really talking about is  containment within the existing parameters for North Korea rather than  abandonment of nuclear weapons.  If that is the case, and again, this is  \"The Times,\" this is me, it suggests that really, you're looking at an Iran  type of situation where all you're doing is aiming to contain rather than  abolish?  </p><p>GHOSH:  No, actually not as even as good as the Iran deal if we look at it  again more closely.  The United States is giving security guarantees to the  North Koreans, the North Koreans are not giving -- the word \"guarantee\"  does not leave Kim Jong-un's lips even once during this entire discussion.  </p><p>So, it seems like a very one-sided deal.  I would disagree with the \"New  York Times\" there.  I don't think this is containment.  This is enablement  in some degree.  It basically takes North Korea's nuclear program and  leaves it intact for an unspecified number of months, years going forward,  at the same time, unilaterally, without consulting with the South Koreans,  President Trump announces that there will be no more war games.  Those  military exercises which were a big part of the containment.  </p><p>Keep in mind, for decades, containment has been the only option and those  military exercises have been the main instrument, if you like of  containment, now that instrument has been taken off the table.  Where is  the containment?  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, Bobby, good to see you.  Thank you.  </p><p>GHOSH:  Anytime.  </p><p>QUEST:  There's plenty for us to talk about that we will keep looking at  this as we continue, there is so much.  The thing we are watching out for  is the decision in the AT&amp;T case -- the AT&amp;T and Time Warner -- parent  company of this network -- the Judge any time now, it may even have started  reading his judgment.  As soon as we get an idea of what that judgment is,  whence CNN will be bringing you that decision and the analysis, because  it's more than just a case about this company and AT&amp;T, it is antitrust and  it promises to change the landscape of corporate America.  We will have  that in a moment.  </p><p>Choppy is the best word to describe Wall Street's changing.  Looking at the  graph and you'll see what I mean.  Although it was predominantly down,  having --</p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  -- been off very sharply at around what?  Three o'clock in the  afternoon, rallies back up again and ekes out just a small loss at 1.58 and  I think that that economy shows you more than anything else the nature of  the market, the way indeed it rallied.  And the NASDAQ closed at a record  high, so you have a record -- all the market, the two markets that barely  made it -- sure did.  </p><p>And if you look at the traveling trading post, it is the 19th record this  year.  Later in the week of course, when I am back in New York, we will  very much look forward to getting back to the trading post and changing the  numbers actually for you on the boards.  </p><p>Tesla shares ended in the day up.  They've been as much as six percent  higher after one analyst raised the forecast of deliveries of Model 3.  It  fell back when Elon Musk confirmed the company will lay off 9 percent of  its workforce.  Paul La Monica is following it all.  </p><p>The stock is still up though some 30 percent or 40 percent since its lows  earlier in the year last year, so Musk is doing something right.  </p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, I think that investors clearly do  believe Elon Musk when he talks and tweets about these ambitious goals for  when Model 3's are going to be delivered to consumers and start hitting the  streets.  Of course, the problem that Tesla has faced is that, they have  been going for a lot of cash, and they have been losing money and  unfortunately, for workers that is going to mean that there will be some  layoffs and I think, you know, the sad reality is that Tesla bulls will  probably applaud this because it may finally show some financial discipline  from Elon Musk which isn't something that I think is always associated with  him.  </p><p>QUEST:  Right, so the first point of course is, will they meet their  however many thousand, I think it was 5,000 or whatever Model 3's that they  are expecting to produce.  They are getting close to it with 3, 000 to  3,500, to 4,000 -- so that's the first issue.  </p><p>But then of course, there is the ramp up of production over the whole model  range and the trucks and all the other things.  Is there a feeling that  Tesla has pardoned upon, turned the corner?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, I think that the key question is does Tesla have the  financial resources to do everything that Musk ambitiously wants to do.  As  you pointed out, Richard, there is the Model 3.  There is the Model S and  Model X of course, and then there is the semi-trucks and then they are also  still integrating Solar City, which is going to be building solar roof  panels on homes and other buildings.  Musk has a lot on his plate just at  Tesla.  </p><p>Then you have SpaceX, you have the Boring Company, you have all of these  tweets that he is lashing out against the media.  He is a very busy guy and  I think it's a question of whether or not he can accomplish everything that  he is setting out to do because he is just one person and last I checked,  cloning was not one of the many things that Musk is working on.  </p><p>QUEST:  No, Paul, you and I have argued and discussed this before.  I am in  the camp that says the guy is a visionary.  Yes, he may be a bit weird and  bizarre occasionally, but he has done more in a short period of time than  most Chief Execs do in their entire life.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Oh, I am not by any -- you know, I am not at all trying to say  that Elon Musk should be criticized for having the great visionary ideas  that he has, but there is a difference between doing what he does and  saying that you're going to do something and being able to actually  accomplish it.  </p><p>And, you know, also, I don't remember Steve Jobs and other visionary  repeatedly bashing the media the way Musk does as well.  So, from a self- serving standpoint, it's a little frustrating that Elon Musk lash out at us  all the time.  </p><p>QUEST:  Care to take a punt on what Judge Leon is going to decide.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I am not going there at all.  We are going to find out very  soon, so I will punt on taking a punt.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, but I think you'd agree whichever way it goes, I was  just thinking about this.  Whichever way it goes, the landscape for  antitrust and corporate America, never mind just the media industry,  shifts, if he decides in favor of AT&amp;T-Time Warner, then the vertical rules  change.  </p><p>If he decides in favor of the Justice Department, then they most certainly  change.  So, whichever way this goes, what do you think?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, I think it is safe to say that if Judge Leon rules in of  AT&amp;T and Time Warner and doesn't put may condition on the deal.  There  likely will be other media mergers coming and the other thing I think,  Richard is if this deal does go through, I can tell my mother, \"I work for  the phone company,\" and she might finally have some understanding of what I  do for a living.  </p><p>QUEST:  She might finally say, \"You've got an honest job.\"  You've got an  honest job and you're working for a real company, and you might know that  nonsense on the media.  All right, Paul La Monica, Guru La Monica.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you, sir.  </p><p>QUEST:  There is an ace to stop the rebellion --</p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>QUEST:  -- by comprising with the MPs who wanted the final say on Brexit.   Now, some of the main supporters had wanted a more definitive say if they  disagreed on the Brexit deal.  It would have undermined the Prime  Minister's negotiating ability in the long run.  That's according to the  Brexit Minister.  </p><p>(START VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DAVID DAVIES, BRITISH SECRETARY OF STATE:  The government cannot  demonstrate the flexibility necessary for successful negotiation if its  hands are tied midway through the process.  That will do nothing but  guarantee a bad deal for Britain.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>QUEST:  It was the key vote on a string of amendments that was proposed by  the Upper House of Lords.  A former Justice Minister has resigned ahead of  the vote saying that Brexit is detrimental to business.  Now, the Minister  -- the former Minister Phillip Lee said, \"In extensive consultations with  local employers -- large and small -- I have been warned that they expect  Brexit, as it is currently being pursued would have a negotiated settlement  will damage their business.\"  </p><p>This shows the febrile nature of the British tabloids where absolutely,  unequivocal about the role of Parliament that it has to say Brexit.  If you  look at the \"Daily Express,\" \"Ignore the will of the people at your peril,\"  and \"The Sun\" delivered a warning to MP's, \"Great Britain or Great  Betrayal.\"  Now, you can't necessarily see this here, but if you noticed,  on the cover, it is peppered with British icons.  </p><p>You've got the Angel of the North in Northern England, you've got the mini  car, you've got the red bus and of course, you've got the red arrows and  you've got a spit fire.  You could see more on the picture there.  </p><p>Tim Martin is the Founder and Chairman of JD Wetherspoon, a branded hotel  chain, he joins me now.  I think I am not doing you a disservice when I say  you are an ardent Brexiteer.  </p><p>TIM MARTIN, FOUNDER AND CHAIRMAN, JD WETHERSPOON:  I have been called out,  Richard, and I won't argue, you're right.  </p><p>QUEST:  All right, and so you have a plan, you have a policy.  You have an  idea of what you think this should look like afterwards.  You can't be  pleased with the way it is going at the moment.  </p><p>MARTIN:  I think it's turning into a bit of a dog's dinner.  I think that  the government should approach the negotiations in another way.  The EU is  a protectionist system.  It charges tariffs.  We could have made food and  everything else cheaper in the shops.  We have eliminated the tariffs and  just left the EU and instead of paying them 39 billion, we could have  allocated that money to UK consumers, so you wouldn't have had -- we could  have regained control of our fishing.  </p><p>If you'd done those three things, you wouldn't have been reliant on the EU.   We would be better off now and I think we would be better off than if we  had a deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  But you couldn't not pay the exit bill.  I mean, in the sense that  that would be reneging on previously agreed expenditure that the UK signed  up for.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Well, I understand that the legal advice on that is there is no  legal obligation to pay it and certainly, and certainly, no one has turned  around and explained to the British public or even the media exactly on  what basis there is some sort of obligation to pay that.  I think we are  paying it to try and persuade them to do a free trade deal.  </p><p>QUEST:  Would you be in favor more of a -- as the FT put in this morning,  the Donald Trump approach?  Tell them where to go, tell them where to stick  it and if they don't like it, end of subject?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Well, the trouble with Donald Trump is he is a divisive character.   I would go for the approach of saying, we want to be friends with you in  the EU, you are very good suppliers.  You are nice people, but we aren't  dependent on a deal with you.  This is what we are going to (inaudible) --  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>QUEST:  But we are -- this is the problem here.  Every business person I  speak to says that if we crash out of the EU, then the effect will be  devastating on the British government.  </p><p>MARTIN:  That is a complete fallacy and it is just politics transferred  into the minds of the Board rooms who have argued that if we leave the EU,  its protectionist system, prices in the shops go down plus, we don't have  to pay them $10 billion a year, plus, we regain control of our fishing  market, plus we --  </p><p>QUEST:  But every company that does business across the channel will  suddenly be faced with a level of complexity that they don't currently  employ.  It would crash out.  </p><p>MARTIN:  No, because you abolish tariffs for the rest of the world, America  for example, no tariffs and that means no tariffs from the EU.  So you  would be in a better position.  The main thing to understand is the EU is 7  percent of the world, it is a protectionist system, it has tariffs for the  other 93 percent -- abolish it, get out of the EU, you're trading with 93  percent of the world.  We will get our prices down and our pubs tomorrow  for food and drink, if we leave the EU and the customs union, a lot of  people in Britain just don't understand that, but that is the truth.  </p><p>QUEST:  But if you're told as we are that 40 percent of the exports do go  to the --  </p><p>[16:20:15]  </p><p>QUEST:   -- and it's more, it's about 50 percent to 55 percent, do go to  the EU, they will be tariff-ed immediately by the other side, and even if  they are not tariff-ed, there will be a complexity to doing this.  Let's  forget about Northern Ireland there, that's entirely different.  Let's just  talk about on the back burner at the moment.  There would be a difficulty  in just saying goodbye, turn the lights off.  </p><p>MARTIN:  None at all.  We trade with the EU.  We buy champagne, we buy wine  et cetera, we can switch tomorrow and eliminate all trade with the EU if  you want to and get wine from America, from the new world, Australia et  cetera, from South America, and it's not going to make an iota of  difference.  </p><p>It will force the EU to become more competitive.  At the moment, we sell --  the top selling house wine is from Australia and New Zealand and it has got  a tariff, so why should our customers pay tariff to Brussels?  </p><p>QUEST:  Now, one thing that is clear, the EU has fought harder to maintain  the integrity of the single market.  Now, they always said they would, but  the British people were told by Brexiteers, not you particularly, but by  others they were told when push comes to shove, when the crunch time  happens, the EU will cave so far -- but that does not appear to be the  case.  </p><p>MARTIN:  They will cave in five minutes flat if we say we are going to  leave without a deal.  We are going to abolish all tariffs and if you dare  charge us tariffs, watch your BMW sales and your champagne sales, we are  the second biggest market for both those products, I think in the whole  world, go to zero.  </p><p>QUEST:  And they are prepared to accept that.  Someone is saying -- someone  said that is the price that Merkel will tell her people, \"That's the price  we are going to pay.\"  </p><p>MARTIN:  I am going to have to swear in television --  </p><p>QUEST:  No, you're not.  </p><p>MARTIN:  But no, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  </p><p>QUEST:  Tim, it is always good to have you.  I noticed, there's been a lot  of talk about champagne, a lot of talk about all of these things and there  is no evidence of it in front of us.  </p><p>MARTIN:  I am disappointed.  </p><p>QUEST:  You're the hotelier and hospitality, man, you should be -- good to  see you, Tim.  </p><p>MARTIN:  Thanks a lot.  </p><p>QUEST:  As always.

In \"Business  Frontier,\" Anna Stewart looks at how tech is making their lives easier  including wheelchairs on demand.  </p><p>(START VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Approximately 15 percent of the world's  population has some form of disability according to the World Health  Organization.  And for those one billion people, a routine every day task  can be a daunting ordeal.  </p><p>Kanai was 10 years old when she was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.   Four years ago, age 20, a wheelchair became a key to her mobility.  After  being impressed by the Whill electric wheelchair, she decided to start  working for the company.  </p><p>KANAI, WHEELCHAIR USER:  (Through an interpreter).  Japan has limited space  in public facilities like this market.  So, wheelchairs need to be agile.   When I was using an ordinary wheelchair, I used to check on Google Maps to  look for obstacles in the streets that might block my mobility.  </p><p>Now, I can go over most of that, so I do not need to prepare in advance.  </p><p>STEWART:  That's because Whill uses the omni wheel, a normal wheel  surrounded by many separate tires which all rotate.  It means, these chairs  can both bridge gaps and still turn in a tight radius.  </p><p>It is not the only company to make these advances in personal mobility  vehicles, but Whill's latest innovation is set to take its unique features  to another level altogether.  </p><p>Introducing the autonomous wheelchair.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through an interpreter).  It's like either you have an  app and you call up the wheelchair.  It arrives, you use it, and then  release it when you're done.  </p><p>STEWART:  And it's not just designed to help disabled people.  It could  help Japan's aging population, too.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through an interpreter).  There is a negative image  associated with wheelchairs.  Many people say they would rather stay at  home rather than use a wheelchair, which means they stay inside and become  an (inaudible).  They are physically and mentally -- if we can change the  image, we can help more people go out and live a healthy, full life.  </p><p>STEWART:  Working in collaboration with Panasonic, the autonomous wheel  launched a trial at Tokyo's Haneda Airport, and now Panasonic hopes the  technology will be rolled out in time for the Tokyo Olympic Games.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (Through a translator).  Come 2020, we would like to  make this kind of mobility available not only at airports, but also in  towns and stadiums.  Handicapped people have few chances to go to the  stadium for sports games, so we hope they can go to sports venues and  paralympic games.  We hope that people say the world changed after 2020.  </p><p>STEWART:  And it's not just about boosting confidence day to day.  This has  helped boost Kanai's hopes for the --  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>STEWART:   -- future.  </p><p>KANAI:  (Through an interpreter).  My disease will progress, but the new  technology will allow me to do more.  And  to live the way that I do now.   I don't know what ability I might lose next, but I have hope now that this  technology will solve the problem.  </p><p>STEWART:  Anna Stewart, CNNMoney, Tokyo.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>QUEST:  So, it has been 598 days since AT&amp;T announced it had agreed to buy  our parent company, Time Warner.

One Morocco committee member says presidents feud with  Canada and Mexico is undermining the case on North America.  It's the anti- trust case of the century.  A court room drama which has bided two giants  of corporate America against the Trump administration. </p><p>On one hand, U.S. Department of Justice, on the other, AT&amp;T and Time  Warner; the parent of this network.  Now, these are the players in their  own words. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEFF BEWKES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TIME WARNER:  By combining with AT&amp;T,  we can accelerate the process of introducing innovations on a nationwide  basis.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I'm not going to get  involved in litigation, but personally, I've always felt that that was a  deal that's not good for the country. </p><p>RANDALL STEPHENSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AT&amp;T:  When we announced this  deal, the best legal minds in the country agreed that this transaction will  be approved since our companies don't even compete with each other.  But  here we are. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Now, the analysts believe a decision will trigger a domino effect  across corporate America once it takes place.  So keep the AT&amp;T domino  towards, yes, are more likely than Comcast will fight for 21st Century Fox  and that's been of course against Disney, that's a huge bid in its own  right, another global bid. </p><p>It could then bolden CVS; the drugstore trying to buy Aetna, another  vertical, and that's a deal worth $69 billion.  And then you got the  smaller media companies than AT -- no, taking on the giants.  Now, that's  the new -- that way. </p><p>But tip the dominos towards no deal or Time Warner may break up, you can  see the selloff of Turner, which is our parent and CNN, which is part of  Turner.  It would show the Justice Department is taking an activist role  for AT&amp;T on competition grounds. </p><p>The trouble for mergers between Sprint and mobile would also -- T-Mobile  would also be absolutely in trouble, all of which if the Justice Department  prevails in this case.  And when you put it all together and you see all  the various different manifestations and the dominos that can fall, you  realize that it all hinges on one little tip of the domino. </p><p>It all starts with one little push.  Dylan Byers is CNNMoney's senior  reporter for media and politics and joins me now.  Which way -- oh, you  don't have, you can plead the Fifth on this. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>DYLAN BYERS, CNNMONEY SENIOR REPORTER FOR MEDIA &amp; POLITICS:  What I will  say is you can't sort of read the tea leaves here in the fact that the  judge has invited the media back to hear his ruling which he's going to  read out loud.</p><p>Usually in a case like this, you just have a written ruling because there's  a simple decision one way or the other and then the dominos fall as you  showed one way or the other.  So what that says to me is that he's going to  have a complex ruling -- it's very likely and I think this is the  conventional wisdom right now among analysts and the media, that he will  approve the deal, but he will approve the deal with certain conditions.</p><p>Now, that's just a conventional wisdom, anything could happen here.  The  fact that this even went to trial and took 500-plus days was not something  I think that AT&amp;T and Time Warner anticipated.  So, we're on pins and  needles here waiting to see what happens.</p><p>And like you said, the ramifications for the industry are enormous.</p><p>QUEST:  All right, the way in which it moves forward.  So for example, if  AT&amp;T loses, if -- and Time Warner lose, does that transaction fall apart  because the deadline is next week to complete the deal, and after that  deadline, either side can if they wanted to get out. </p><p>And what we hear of course is, there are some who are saying, since the  fall in AT&amp;T share price, actually Time Warner would be wise to look  elsewhere.</p><p>BYERS:  Well, look, I do think it would be a major blow to have the judge  rule against the deal.  I think what happens after that, look, there's  always the possibility of appeal, there are various ways this can go.  But  yes, it would conceivably, it would put Time Warner back on the market.</p><p>And then the question which she poses, do you then break up the Time Warner  assets, all of a sudden are things like \"Hbo\", Turner, CNN, are they  looking for buyers elsewhere? But you know, the -- part of the issue here  with the judge's ruling is what's really in question is what right do  telecom companies and tech companies have to buy a media acquisition?</p><p>[16:35:00] And if you say no to that, you put a freeze on potential M&amp;A  across the board, at least, you know, conceivably through the rest of the  Trump administration.  If you say yes to that, you open up the flood gates  of mergers and acquisitions and media that may ultimately result -- you  know, you look now, we've got really about across the tech, media and  telecom space, about 16 big companies.</p><p>Ten years from now if this deal goes through, all of a sudden, you could  have half that money.  And you could really be talking about a future where  all media is owned by technology companies and telecom companies and is  becoming increasingly hard to really understand the difference between  those players since they are all playing in the content game, and they are  trying at least to bring that content direct to consumers without any  middle men. </p><p>QUEST:  The judge knows his stuff, doesn't he? I mean, here's one of the  experts in not only anti-trust, but also having done the Comcast-NBC case,  so in many ways would be regarded as the right -- the right judge on the  right case. </p><p>BYERS:  He is and there's been a lot of -- there's been a lot of cloud  around this decision, about sort of, you know, was there any political  influence here from President Trump in terms -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>BYERS:  Blocking this deal, even because CNN, our network was involved.  At  the end of the day, this is coming down to a judge who like you said has a  great deal of experience, who to the best of our knowledge adheres very  close to the letter of the law and will make a decision based off of not  the considerations of executives or -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>BYERS:  Politicians, but of the considerations of the consumer.  And that  is that, at the end of the day is all you can hope for.</p><p>QUEST:  Haven't you got a newsletter to go and write? </p><p>BYERS:  I do, I actually do, get sort of benign for the start on tomorrow's  newsletter.        </p><p>QUEST:  Then let me stop you because there's a newsletter, we'll have a lot  more on this once we have the decision.  Thanks Dylan, it's called -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BYERS:  Thank you -- </p><p>QUEST:  It looks as -- well, the worlds of technology and media, some would  say collide, I might say come together, co-exist, it's a pacific --  cnn.pacific.com to make sure you subscribe.</p><p>Donald Trump is sometimes referred to as the CEO and chief, the real estate  mogul inside scenes derides the surface as he spoke to the press after  meeting North Korean leader. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  We have great beaches.

What if? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  North Korea's made recent efforts to both destroy some industry,  it's improve the airports and hotel options in sea-side city of Wonsan  previously used for missile testing.  </p><p>Joining me is Simon Cockerell, the General Manager of Koryo Tourism,  specializing in leading trips to North Korea.  Just how many people go to  North Korea?</p><p>SIMON COCKERELL, GENERAL MANAGER, KORYO TOURS:  Well, many tens of  thousands actually, the vast majority of them being mainland Chinese  businesses.  Of the non -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>COCKERELL:  Chinese businesses, around 5,000 or so per year as tourists. </p><p>QUEST:  So you're from a low base, you have the potential for a huge  growth.  Are you seeing more interest from people.  Obviously, following  the awfulness of places -- of death of people like Otto Warmbier and the  like. </p><p>There have been other reluctant to even set foot in the place in case  something goes wrong -- </p><p>COCKERELL:  Well -- </p><p>QUEST:  But that could change. </p><p>COCKERELL:  Yes, I mean, actually the numbers were much lower several years  ago, just a few hundred people.  Since around 2012, the numbers have been  fairly steady, four to five and a half thousand people per year.  These are  very low numbers of course. </p><p>The first half of last year was the biggest six months first day in our  industry, and then the second half was very small, thanks -- well, due  largely in part to the Warmbier case that you mentioned, but also the  nuclear tests, missile tests, the whole drama of North Korea. </p><p>The -- you know, the threats and the rhetoric pouring out.  But there's  been a bit of a recovery, but the numbers again are very small, so small  enough that a handful of people can suddenly make it seem like a it's  resurgent.</p><p>So there's room for growth -- </p><p>QUEST:  Yes -- </p><p>COCKERELL:  Only so much actually.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, well, that's because of infrastructure and the like.  And when  Donald Trump, you heard just earlier, you heard him talking about -- I  mean, you can't take the real estate man or the builder out of him, can  you? </p><p>[16:40:00] He took it -- he immediately sees it and immediately wants to  talk, put up condos and beach resorts. </p><p>Is this at all realistic that North Korea could develop some form of  significant tourism industry? </p><p>COCKERELL:  Well, he's a little late to the game on that, because on the  Caramoan Peninsula, opposite the city of Wonsan, the exact area he's  referring to for -- where there are artillery barrage took place not so  long ago.  There's a tourist resort under construction, now a 100-plus  buildings. </p><p>Who it's being built for, nobody is quite sure, probably more domestic  tourists or a kind of aspirational hope that more Chinese tourists and even  South Korean tourists will visit, because the western tourist market, the  market -- my company Koryo Tours has no need for tourist resort of a 100  buildings.</p><p>So it is possible as you said, new international airport has been built,  but so far, after a year, nearly two years of operation, that airport has  received a little of handful of flights.  So it's something for the future  -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>COCKERELL:  Shall we say, not for the near future, maybe. </p><p>QUEST:  And if I was to go for my annual vacation to North Korea, what's  the one thing I must see? </p><p>COCKERELL:  That's a good question.  If it was your first trip to North  Korea, the one thing you should see, I would say would be the capital city  Pyongyang and at least one other place outside.  So most tourists go to the  demilitarized zone, DM Zone or DMZ on a de facto borderline with South  Korea. </p><p>But I just returned from my 170th trip actually last week, and I spent most  of that trip on the east coast, in Wonsan, industrial city -- </p><p>QUEST:  Right -- </p><p>COCKERELL:  Of Hamhung and the diamond mountain area.  So you should get  out of the capital and see not just where the middle class and the consumer  class live, and try and get a sense of a cross-section of society as much  as you can in a very restricted place and in limited time, of course. </p><p>QUEST:  Thank you sir, thank you for joining us.  Now, the experts are  arguing vividly over who was the winner and loser from the Singapore  Summit.  As one group that definitely won, PotCoin.  </p><p>Marijuana cryptocurrency supported Dennis Rodman's trip, it was at numerous  amounts today, 13 percent, 14 percent.  While Rodman's trip had been  accused of being able to visibly (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>The former U.S. head of National Intelligence said he could actually make a  difference. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JAMES CLAPPER, FORMER UNITED STATES DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:  He  is a unique person since he has a relationship with both Kim Jong-un and  with Donald Trump.  And obviously has great rapport with Kim, who is a  basketball fanatic himself. </p><p>So I think that there's a potential here to engage Dennis Rodman in a  serious way in promoting this relationship. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  Dennis Rodman spoke to CNN during the summit itself, and his  passion for North Korea's future was obvious. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DENNIS RODMAN, FORMER BASKETBALL PLAYER:  I talked to Kim Jong-un and an  administration over there five years ago.  And he asked me five years ago,  we sat down for lunch, and he sat down and asked me, hey, Dennis, I'll like  to ask you three things if you go back to tell the president of the United  States these three things and I will be willing to talk to him. </p><p>And this is a true story, and I got my people here that was there that  heard the conversation.  He said things like, if they can move the ships  from South Korea, I would do what I have to do to listen. </p><p>If you can lose certain things, do certain things, I will listen, my ears  will be open.  And I tried to do that to Obama and Obama didn't even give  me the time of day.  I asked him, I said, I have something to say from  North Korea, he just brushed me off. </p><p>But that didn't deter me, I still kept going back, I kept going back, I  kept going back, I showed my loyalty and my trustworthiness to this  country, and I said to everybody, I said the door will open.</p><p>It was amazing, it's amazing when I said those things -- when I said those  damn things, when I went back home, I got so many death threats, I got so  many death threats, so I was sitting up, protecting everything.  And I  believe in North Korea. </p><p>And when I went home, I came into a home, I came into a home after a  hideout for 30 days, I couldn't even go home, but I kept my head up high,  brother, I knew things will change, I knew it, I was the only one, I never  had no one to hear me, I never had no one to see me. </p><p>But I took those voice, I took all that, I took everything, everyone came  at me, but I'm still standing.  It took days, some great days -- now,  everybody say therefore, talking of China, everybody, it's a great day! I'm  here to see it, I'm so happy. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>QUEST:  And with that, we'll take a break. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  We've got breaking news.  A judge has just  ruled on the AT&amp;T and Time Warner merger.  Of course, we need to point out  that CNN is a unit of Time Warner.  CNN's Justice Correspondent, Jessica  Schneider is live for us at the courthouse.  Jessica, what can you tell us? </p><p>JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Jake, quite simply,  the judge in this case, the federal district court judge has essentially  approved this merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner, AT&amp;T's acquisition of  Time Warner. </p><p>I just got out of the court room, Judge Richard Leon for 30 minutes read  his opinion and at the end of it, he said that basically, the government's  three series of harm, all three series, they did not meet their burden of  proof to show that there will be a substantial lessening of competition if  in fact AT&amp;T acquired Time Warner. </p><p>So again, this was a six-week trial, the judge ruling today that this  merger can in fact go forward.  And beyond that, I mean, this is really a  complete and total wimp AT&amp;T.  And what could happen at this point forward  is that the government after losing in this case, they could ask for a stay  of this opinion as they go for appeal. </p><p>And what's important about that is that could effectively render this deal  dead.  You know, this deal would have to go through by June 21st, that's  the merger deadline that has been set by both AT&amp;T and Time Warner, that at  which point either party, either company can walk away. </p><p>With the end of his ruling here, after the judge said that the government  has failed to prove that the judge should deny this merger.  The judge went  even further than that, and the judge said to the government in very stern  words, think before you go to the appeals process with this. </p><p>Think before you move for a stay here.  He said that AT&amp;T had already  suffered harm in this, given that the government has been working to block  this merger since this -- since the lawsuit in November and since the trial  started in March. </p><p>I just want to -- you know, a bit of the language that the judge gave here.   Again, it was quite stern towards the government.  He said I hope the  senior leadership of government will see how unlikely it will be to get a  stay and how manifestly unfair it will be when deciding whether to seek  this stay. </p><p>So the judge warning the government after the government has lost this case  which the government argued for six weeks here at this federal courthouse,  saying to them, think twice here before you move forward with any motion to  stay, whether you move forward with any plans to appeal. </p><p>Because again, Jake, this merger deadline is just days away on June 21st,  if the deal doesn't go forward by then, either party could walk away from  this.  So that is why the judge had to get this ruling out today to allow  that appeals -- time for appeal. </p><p>So again, Jake, to reiterate, the judge here in this case has effectively  approved this merger to go forward, pending any appeal or motion to stay by  the government.  But again, the judge warning the government think twice  before you do this because the judge says I don't think you have a great  case on appeal.  Jake? </p><p>TAPPER:  All right, Jessica Schneider at the court house for us, I want to  bring in CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin.  Jeffrey, on the face of  it, it looks like a setback if not a big defeat for the Trump Justice  Department.  What's your take? </p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  I would say it's a setback and a big  defeat for the Trump Justice Department.  I mean, this was a scathing and  total rejection of the government's theory that this merger would violate  anti-trust law. </p><p>But we have not yet had access to the 470-page opinion of Judge Leon.  But  you know, he went through each of the government's theories of why this  merger would lessen competition and be bad for consumers.  And in each  case, he rejected the government's contention that this would be a bad  merger for consumers. </p><p>[16:50:00] And then as Jessica told you, a really unusual part of his  opinion was him saying to the government, look, don't even bother appealing  because if you appeal, if you get a stay, you will kill the deal even if  you -- that -- the appeals court ultimately sides with AT&amp;T and Time  Warner. </p><p>That the procedure will take over for the substance.  So he was saying,  look, admit, you lost and let this deal go forward.  You can sue later, he  said to the government to break up the company, but don't try to stop this  merger at this late day. </p><p>That was a very unusual thing that the judge did, and it's basically a sign  of how much he rejected the Trump Justice Department's arguments in this  case.</p><p>TAPPER:  And Jeffrey, let me ask you, President Trump, when he was just  candidate Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, he expressed  opposition to this deal.  Now, on its face, his opposition, his political  oppositions seemed rooted in the fact that he obviously does not like CNN  and Time Warner is our parent company. </p><p>The Justice Department attorney arguing against this merger on anti-trust  grounds.  How much did any of it had to do with President Trump's political  argument and stated anonymous CNN.</p><p>TOOBIN:  You know, you know, Jake, that is in many respects the most  interesting part of the case, and it never appeared in the court room.   Judge Leon, at the very beginning of the case said to both parties, I am  not going to examine the political motivations of the Justice Department.</p><p>I am not going to even let Time Warner look at whether there were  communications between candidate Trump, President Trump and his Justice  Department about this case.  I am not going to allow that to be in the  evidence presented at all.</p><p>So that was not part of the case.  The judge decided this case solely on  the grounds of anti-trust law, not on the motivations of the Justice  Department.  And now, in light of this extremely comprehensive rejection of  the government's theory, certainly, many people will ask, why did they  bring this case at all? Because of candidate Trump's outspoken opposition  to it. </p><p>But in terms of the evidence in the court room, Donald Trump, President  Trump's statements about the merger never played a part. </p><p>TAPPER:  How fascinating, stay there, Jeffrey, I want to bring in CNN  senior media correspondent Brian Stelter.  And Brian, what stands out to  you about this position, about Judge Leon.</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN SENIOR MEDIA CORRESPONDENT:  Well, this is a ruling that  will be heard throughout the business world.  It's a shock that's going to  cause a lot of other reactions.  We're going to see Comcast in the coming  days, go ahead and challenge Disney for Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century \"Fox\"  assets.</p><p>We're going to see other mergers and acquisitions now as a result, all  because there was essentially a holding pattern all waiting for this  ruling.  And there were many companies watching on the sidelines, wondering  what the judge will do. </p><p>And now that we have the answer, and the answer is so clear, you know, this  is not a ruling with a lot of conditions as many expected, there are not a  lot of strings attached, it sounds like there are no strings attached, it  is a very clear and comprehensive ruling, so it's a giant thumbs up for the  American business world. </p><p>And that's why beyond just the media industry, it's an important moment for  American business, they be given a thumbs up to go and pursue some more of  these deals.  In terms of our channel and our parent company, we're going  to see AT&amp;T move quickly to try and close this deal now.</p><p>It's been more than 18 months since the deal was struck, since this attempt  to do this acquisition was announced, it's been a very long road, there's  an opportunity of course associated with this, with this trial and with the  long delay. </p><p>And so now AT&amp;T -- unless there's a stay, unless there's an injunction,  unless the government goes in and tries to get that, then we'll see these  two companies come together next week, so just six days from now, CNN will  be owned by AT&amp;T. </p><p>TAPPER:  And let's go back to CNN's Jessica Schneider who is live at the  court house, and Jessica, you have a statement from the lawyer from the  Justice Department -- from the Trump Justice Department about the case.   What does he have to say? </p><p>SCHNEIDER:  Great, Jake, a swift reaction from the Department of Justice  Makan Delrahim; he's the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the  Antitrust division.  He was in the court room today, he was in the court  room throughout this six-week trial, just now issuing a statement here,  I'll read it for you. </p><p>He says \"we are disappointed with the court's decision today.  We continue  to believe that the paid TV market will be less competitive and less  innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&amp;T and Time Warner. </p><p>We will closely review the court's opinion and consider next steps in light  of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American  consumers.\"  So the Department of Justice there, Makan Delrahim not saying  whether or not the government might seek a stay, might go forward with an  appeal or start something, the judge warns sternly against. </p><p>[16:55:00] And it's interesting that the Department of Justice and its  statement still holding to their argument that this acquisition, this  merger would be anti-competitive especially because the judge just spent 20  minutes in court, knocking down each and every argument line by line, bit  by bit. </p><p>The judge in fact at one point in terms of one of their argument put it  this way, he said neither category of evidence was effective, it was too  speculative in nature, it was contradicted by the government's own  evidence, and at the end he said, this evidence had little to no value.</p><p>But in this statement from the Department of Justice, Jake, Makan Delrahim;  the deputy -- the Antitrust chief seeming to stick by the government's  argument and not giving an indication whether they'll take heed in the  judge's warning not to move forward on the appeal.  Jake. </p><p>TAPPER:  All right, Jessica, thank you so much.  Let me bring back Jeffrey  Toobin, and Jeffrey, obviously, just to remind our viewers, CNN has a  vested interest in this major case because Time Warner is our parent  company.  Putting that aside for a second and putting aside whether or not  this is the right decision by Judge Leon or not. </p><p>Is it consistent with the Trump Justice Department and its attitude towards  business? In other words, does trying to stop this merger make sense  because of the other principles and ideals that the Trump administration  argues for either through the Antitrust division of the Justice Department  or elsewhere.</p><p>TOOBIN:  You know, Jake, that is incredibly important question.  And that  is why there has been so much suspicion about the motives behind the  Justice Department's decision to try to stop this merger.</p><p>Republicans in general, conservatives in general, going back to the days of  Robert Burke(ph) who was sort of the great genius of conservative view of  antitrust law have taken a hands off view towards mergers. </p><p>They basically had a laissez faire approach, the government should stay out  of the business of regulating, of stopping mergers.  What makes people --  what made people so suspicious of the government's motive in this case was  that here you have a Republican Justice Department trying to challenge  after merger. </p><p>Even more unusual was the fact, what this is known as what's called a  vertical merger where AT&amp;T and Time Warner are not competitive.  They are - - Time Warner is a supplier of content to AT&amp;T, vertical mergers like that  are almost never threatened, are never challenged by any Justice  Department, Democrat or Republican. </p><p>The horizontal mergers, when competitors merge, that tends to be when the  government gets involved.  So the fact that this was a Republican  administration challenging a vertical merger suggested perhaps that some  other motives were in play other than simply a neutral application of  antitrust law.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Timothy Wu right now.  He's a professor at  Columbia Law School.  Timothy, what's your take on the ruling? </p><p>TIMOTHY WU, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA LAW SCHOOL:  Yes, I mean, I haven't read it  like everyone else, but my suspicion is that it may go so far and the  Justice Department will want to -- want to appeal this. </p><p>You know, they -- a lot of people in the antitrust law have been wanting to  bring back scrutiny of vertical mergers, the idea that the government loses  this case totally seems strong.  They did present a lot of evidence, so I  wouldn't be surprised if Justice does seek the appeal as a -- even despite  the district court judge telling them not to.</p><p>TAPPER:  And what would be the effect of that? Will that have the effect of  freezing the merger, ending the merger, just the act of appealing? </p><p>WU:  It totally depends on what appellate court does, they may not think  it's enough an emergency to stay the merger, they may stay the merger.   Even if the merger is stayed, it doesn't necessarily mean the merger have  to be abandoned. </p><p>But I think it's possible, but because the government thinks these  principles are important enough, that they'll really want to appeal this.</p><p>TAPPER:  Do you think the judge made the wrong decision today? </p><p>WU:  Well, I haven't read the decision and I haven't seen it as much as  they happen to see that.  It sounds like he's gone pretty far, it sounds  like he's stuck to sort of the 1980s, more kind of a Burke(ph) line on  Chicago line on antitrust, no, we never do anything and I think the law has  evolved since then and economic research has evolved, so this decision may  be vulnerable to appeal for those reasons.</p><p>TAPPER:  We only have about 30 seconds left, but as quickly as you can, I  recognize you could probably speak for six hours on it, why would such a  merger be a bad idea. </p><p>WU:  You know, it's just basically the idea that vertical mergers also cost  consumers money, also interfere with competition, and you know, there's  ruling, again, I haven't read it.  But it sounds like the old 1980s,  Reagan's style, nothing vertical is ever a suspect.</p><p>This was a very big vertical merger, and if it's gone too far, the opinion  may be very susceptible to an appeal.</p><p>TAPPER:  All right, professor, thank you so much for your time -- </p><p>WU:  Sure -- </p><p>TAPPER:  I appreciate it.  That's it for \"THE LEAD\" today.  I turn you over  to Wolf Blitzer.  He is in \"THE SITUATION ROOM.\" Thanks for watching.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.  ALL  RIGHTS  RESERVED.

Market power in digital markets presents a whole new set of dangers,\" said Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David N. Cicilline (D-RI). \"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.\"</p><p>The Committee's investigation will focus on three main areas:</p><p>Documenting competition problems in digital markets;</p><p>Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and</p><p>Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\" said Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the U.S. economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said Ranking Member Collins (R-GA). \"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive. Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action. I appreciate the partnership of Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Subcommittee Ranking Member Sensenbrenner on these important issues\"</p><p>\"Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,\" said Antitrust Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). \"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition. I believe these hearings can be informative, but it is important for us to avoid any predetermined conclusions. I thank Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and Chairman Cicilline as we begin these bipartisan discussions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122976020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W87-TJM1-JCBF-S2D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Cicilline (D-RI). \"After four decades of weak antitrust enforcement and judicial hostility to antitrust cases, it is critical that Congress step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or whether we need new legislation to respond to this challenge.\"</p><p>The Committee's investigation will focus on three main areas:</p><p>* Documenting competition problems in digital markets;</p><p>* Examining whether dominant firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and</p><p>* Assessing whether existing antitrust laws, competition policies, and current enforcement levels are adequate to address these issues.</p><p>\"The open internet has delivered enormous benefits to Americans, including a surge of economic opportunity, massive investment, and new pathways for education online,\" said Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY). \"But there is growing evidence that a handful of gatekeepers have come to capture control over key arteries of online commerce, content, and communications. The Committee has a rich tradition of conducting studies and investigations to assess the threat of monopoly power in the U.S. economy. Given the growing tide of concentration and consolidation across our economy, it is vital that we investigate the current state of competition in digital markets and the health of the antitrust laws.\"</p><p>\"Big Tech plays a huge role in our economy and our world,\" said Ranking Member Collins (R-GA). \"As tech has expanded its market share, more and more questions have arisen about whether the market remains competitive. Our bipartisan look at competition in the digital markets gives us the chance to answer these questions and, if necessary, to take action. I appreciate the partnership of Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee Chairman Cicilline and Subcommittee Ranking Member Sensenbrenner on these important issues\"</p><p>\"Technology has become a crucial part of Americans' everyday lives,\" said Antitrust Subcommittee Ranking Member Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI). \"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition. I believe these hearings can be informative, but it is important for us to avoid any predetermined conclusions. I thank Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member Collins, and Chairman Cicilline as we begin these bipartisan discussions.\"</p><p>Read this original document at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/judiciary-committee-launches-investigation-competition-digital-markets\">https://cicilline.house.gov/press-release/judiciary-committee-launches-investigation-competition-digital-markets</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GOVPUB-COSHM6039117760394</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W89-BFJ1-JCCP-01B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal Information and News Dispatch, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Congressional Documents and Publications</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 3, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Statistics</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

They\"ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" Warren wrote on Medium.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are \"platform utilities\" in Warren\"s sights because not only do they own marketplaces, they take part in them and in doing so, undermine competition and crush small companies.</p><p>Any company with annual global revenue of over US$25 billion ($36.5b) and which owns an app store or similar marketplace would be designated a \"platform utility\" by Warren\"s government, and be broken up.</p><p>Anti-competitive mergers like Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, or Google snapping up navigation company Waze would also be undone if Warren comes to power in 2020.</p><p>The above is music to the ears of telcos, IT companies, retailers and media organisations worldwide that have been flattened under the growing weight of the big tech firms.</p><p>Big tech and investors aren\"t worried though. US sharemarkets are unfazed by Warren\"s threats of regulation, and tech stocks rose.</p><p>Facebook very provocatively pulled the senator\"s ads calling for a big tech breakup, with a lame excuse that the social network\"s logo was misused in the ads; later Facebook said it would restore the ads but the act of removing them shows the social network isn\"t afraid of proving Warren\"s point about having too much power.</p><p>The cat\"s out of the bag, and the business model that uses internet scale to rapidly grow and squeeze out competition isn\"t going away.</p><p>Warren notes that anti-monopoly laws reined in Microsoft in the mid-90s, after the tech giant tried to embrace the internet and extend its operating system dominance to the web.</p><p>Without irony Warren says that the regulatory action helped clear a path for internet companies such as Google and Facebook to emerge, which suggests we\"re going around in circles and that the fundamentals that allow monopoly building and measures against it only after the damage is done are wrong.</p><p>What Warren leaves unsaid is that these days, there\"s bigger than big: China.</p><p>Media darling Huawei for instance runs a computing cloud on top of selling smartphones, computers, telco and network equipment and making chips and software. If you like, that\"s trying to integrate Apple, Amazon Web Services, NokiaSiemens/Ericsson, Intel/Qualcomm and Google within one massive company.</p><p>There are other massive Chinese tech companies like Jingdong, Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu that would easily fit the \"platform utility\" description being vertically integrated.</p><p>Unless they too are cut down to size, breaking up US tech companies would only provide temporary breathing space before their Chinese counterparts rush in and take over.</p><p>Unless Warren figures out how to stop that from happening, today\"s tech monopolies will seem like piddly little players compared to what will appear in the not so distant future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12211961</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMC-K7P1-JCBG-G3D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 12, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Of course, you could argue, as some of it is knee-jerk at this point. I just want to quickly take you to a chart which is a great map, 7385, showing the exemptions so far globally, and from the U.S. tariffs.   </p><p>Japan, notably absent from there. We have seen Japanese equities lead the losses overnight. How bad will things have to get for this sell-off to be sustained?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  I think they would have to get a lot worse, and I don't think they will get a lot worse. So I think much of this is actually symbolic, and I think it's really about Trump appealing to the -- to his base, actually.   </p><p>      I mean, this was a -- a campaign promise, that he was going to do something about sort of undercutting, you know, Chinese imports and the way that that was undercutting U.S. industry. I think he's made that sort of symbolic gesture now.   </p><p>      And it's pretty small-scale, actually. I mean, this is -- this is not going to be -- have a big impact on growth. I think most of the estimates I've seen are about a 0.1 percent impact on U.S. GDP growth.   </p><p>      So it's all about symbolism. It's in line with, if you read \"The Art of the Deal,\" it's in line with sort of making a big hoo-ha and then bringing people to the negotiating table.   </p><p>      So I think the market reaction, probably so far, is already a little bit sort of over -- overdone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Right. And we have seen some key technicals. I can bring up a chart to show you that later. But we are only on day one. What would need to happen where you actually start to become concerned and think that the sell-off could be more sustained?  </p><p>      We heard Tom Mackenzie, there, point to some of the extra measures that China could take.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. I -- I, well, I think it would have to be much more broad-based. I think it would have to be more -- more than just steel and aluminum. It would have to be across the board. It would have to be much more punitive. And then there would have to be immediate escalation. The exemptions would have to be rolled back.   </p><p>      I mean, I suppose technically the exemptions are on a temporary basis. Some of them are sort of, \"We'll have this until -- this exemption until we have a conversation.\" So it could be that when that conversation happens, the exemption is, in fact, repealed.   </p><p>      So it -- it could, in theory, get a -- get a whole lot worse. But I would agree with the analyst that you quoted, that actually this is quite moderate so far. And -- and my sense is that it will remain pretty moderate, and that this will blow over and the news cycle will move on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, good morning, Julian. Listening to Trump's press conference yesterday, and actually listening to what Wilbur Ross had to say. He finished with some quite brief comments, saying \"We'll end up negotiating, not fighting about this,\" were his words.   </p><p>      And then also, another reason to be cheerful if you -- if you like globalization, I suppose. He did talk about the -- the U.S. is going to challenge -- or -- or the government talked about how the U.S. is going to challenge China licensing practices at the WTO.   </p><p>      So some signs, at least, that the aim here is to get to negotiating table, and also that some of the well-trodden routes and paths to resolve these disputes may still be used. Some of those four (ph) that we thought were cast aside by the Trump administration could still be used, such as the WTO.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yeah. I mean, I absolutely agree. I -- I think the aim, here, is not to damage U.S. GDP growth. I mean, the -- the administration has quoted the stock market, GDP growth and unemployment relentlessly since early 2017, as sort of signs of its success in economic policy.   </p><p>      And I think deep down, they realize that a concerted trade war, an all-out trade war, would be absolutely catastrophic. You know, surely the memory of the -- of the 1920s and the way that trade tariffs were increased by six percent, just at the wrong moment, that sent the U.S. into depression -- I think people are still conscious of that.   </p><p>      So I can't imagine that even this administration would want to risk those -- those kind of milestones that it's been marking out so -- so clearly over the last 18 months or so.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  And, Julian, we heard Trump also talk about how this is partly being driven by his desire to reduce the trade deficit with China. What would -- I mean, it -- clearly, a recession in the United States and reducing U.S. consumer spending would -- would do something to go along that route, but he doesn't want to do that, I'm sure.   </p><p>      But -- so what would bring down the trade deficit between the United States and China?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Well, I -- I guess an all-out trade war would, where -- whereby Chinese exports into the U.S. is -- is seriously constrained.   </p><p>      But I -- I think, actually, it's your first point that is the most obvious for bringing down that trade deficit, that actually there's a recession and the U.S. consumer's propensity to consume is based on imports. So as consumers feel wealthier, imports tend to get sucked in. So it would be one of those two things, neither of which is particularly desirable.   </p><p>      So actually, for me, the trade deficit is, in fact, a kind of indicator of economic health. And I don't think we should target it as this sort of boogeyman that needs to be corrected.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Julian, just got to break a headline crossing the Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 4.3 percent, extending its losses.   </p><p>      And at this point, if you're a Bloomberg client I just want to draw your attention to the TLIV blog on the Bloomberg that is tracking all the latest on this day one of a potential trade war, including all the market reaction. And, crucially, some of the key levels you want to watch in these equity indices over in Asia.   </p><p>      We've already seen the MSCI Asia Pacific Index drop below the 50- and 100-day moving average, and also we've seen Japanese equities drop below the 200-day moving average.   </p><p>      But I just want to still show this chart, Julian, which is 5781, and it's the risk-on, risk-off index. Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch did a survey recently, showing that even though investors are really concerned about things like trade, stagflation, they're still long-risk assets. Why?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Well, I think risk assets still represent the best risk-adjusted return versus Treasury bonds. I mean, the equity risk premium at the moment in the United States is two points -- about 2.6 to 2.8 percent.   </p><p>      So you are getting 2.8 percent more from holding stocks than you are from the risk-free rate in treasuries. That's attractive. And history suggests that a risk premium of about 2.8 percent goes on to give you a return of around six to eight percent from equities over the following two years. That's not a bad -- that's not a bad outcome.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  All right. Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, still with us on set in London.   </p><p>      Julian, when you look at the latest changes, we've got concern around protectionism writ large across these markets today. I guess the last thing investors needed was another concern, and that might be geopolitics.   </p><p>      Do these moves increase your concern that the hawk of hawks, as Eurasia (ph) calls him, will bring more geopolitical risk?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, John Bolton wrote this paper, didn't he? I think it was a couple of years ago. \"The Legal Case for Attacking North Korea.\" So we kind of see what his -- what his -- his view is. You've got to -- you've got to set that off against Trump's sort of desire to do a deal.   </p><p>      And I think the idea of sitting down with Kim Jong is actually going to be so tempting for the -- for the U.S. president. You know, to be able to pull off this sort of grand master stroke.   </p><p>      So I think even though there are more hawks in the administration now, I think Trump won't sort of -- resist the temptation to sit down and try and pull off something, incredible deal around North Korea.   </p><p>      Now if that fails, we'll -- we'll have to see. But I think at the moment, it's not obvious that just having John Bolton in there is -- is going to mean a -- a kind of cooling of relations with North Korea.   </p><p>      If anything, things have gone quite well recently, and I think Donald Trump will want to sit down with -- with Kim Jong and try -- try and pull something off.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Julian, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 2.8 percent. Does it go lower from here on these concerns?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  There -- there may be some short-term re-rating of growth, but I think the reason that the Treasury yield hasn't gone lower -- and this was something that we were talking about earlier -- I think it's because a lot of growth has (ph) priced into it.   </p><p>      It's not so much that the break-even is -- is moving, it's not so much an inflation change although that is, partly, a factor because of what Jerome Powell said about inflation. That there is no inflation threat. But it's just still a lot of growth priced into that yield.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes, and I'm so glad we showed this chart that you highlighted there as well, highlighted that point.   </p><p>      Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.   </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Let's now bring in Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.  </p><p>      So, Julian, we've seen the reaction in Asian equities. We'll find out, in about an hour and a half, how European equities are going to react to all this.   </p><p>      In this potential global trade war, how much does Europe actually have to -- have to lose economically?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  I think it could be significant, but I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that initial exemption that's been granted, although it only lasts for -- it's a temporary one. But I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that. So I think -- I think something will be -- something will be sorted out around that.   </p><p>      But I think, potentially, it -- you know, worst case, it could be very, very significant but I just don't think that's going to be the reality. I'm very encouraged that an exemption has been granted in the first instance.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  What sort of impact might we see on the euro in all this? We've seen the yen bid, questions over whether it could go to 100. Does the dollar weaken and therefore the euro strengthens on the back of this and weighs on European inflation --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  -- I mean, what's the dynamic here?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Oh, it could -- I mean, it could even be the other way around --   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  -- but actually, if -- if we have a really big trade war and a massive crisis, economic crisis, you know, the -- the dollar could become a haven currency.   </p><p>      But it -- you know, it used to have that status but it sort of kind of lost out to -- to the Japanese yen. But that could -- that could resume again. So potentially, you could get euro weakening from this point. Which, ironically, would actually be quite helpful for the eurozone's exporters and, indeed, the European equity market.   </p><p>      So there's a lot -- there's a lot of factors swirling around at the moment. So it's very difficult to make a kind of clear currency call on -- on euro-dollar. But generally, euro strength has been a bit of a headwind for European equities. So potentially an unwind of that could -- could be helpful, but for the wrong reasons.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Julian, we heard from Mario Draghi, he was here briefing E.U. leaders yesterday. He talked about four risks. And one of them -- and in fact, the top one -- was around protectionisms. And it's clearly very much on the Central Bank's radar. Protectionism is the biggest risk to the European economy.   </p><p>      He also talks about less reliance on international forums that have been used previously, of course.   </p><p>      But in -- in terms of the size and scope of this -- this fear or this risk, the fact that Draghi puts that at the top at number one, suggests that it's something that the ECB is watching incredibly closely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. And I think that's actually potentially encouraging for -- for European stocks. I mean, it means that the interest rates in -- within the eurozone are going to be kept on the floor. I think that the language is -- was fairly dovish at the last conference.   </p><p>      He cited this risk, he recognizes that the Q.E. program's going to end in September, but he -- he was at pains to say that that doesn't mean that interest rates are going to be the next step.   </p><p>      So rates will stay low and I think this -- any fear of a trade war is going to keep rates even -- even sort of more permanently low than -- than we -- than market currently anticipates. So that could be good for equities.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Could be good (ph) (INAUDIBLE). Interesting story on the Bloomberg, also, around productivity in Europe, Julian. As some of our colleagues writing about how some of the measures that have been taken by European governments are actually driving up productivity that -- labor that was on the sidelines is now coming back into the workforce.   </p><p>      And so as a result, Europe is actually discovering more slack, which means it can continue growing without creating inflation.   </p><p>      Now, while some of that might sound like very good news, as, of course, that makes the ECB's job more difficult when it continues to try and generate inflation.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. I mean, we -- we talk about the Phillips curve challenge (ph) within the U.S., don't we? But Europe isn't even there yet. So we haven't even tested the Phillips curve in Europe.   </p><p>      You know, unemployment is -- is just under, I think, 10 percent at this point. So Europe can actually sustain a sort of Goldilocks scenario, whereby growth continues to improve but there's no inflation.   </p><p>      Yes, that might be frustrating for -- for the ECB, but I think actually it's -- it's probably quite a good state of affairs. And then we can sort of resume the conversation, I guess, when unemployment gets to the sort of six percent, five percent level.   </p><p>      But I think in the meantime, there's quite a nice sort of Goldilocks-type path for Europe, whereby growth improves but there's no -- no price pressure at the same time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  But Julian, what about the fact that we've seen some softness in recent eurozone PMIs for two months in a row, now? And not only that, but if I take you to this chart, 8431, the economic surprise index, the Citi (ph) economic surprise index actually undershooting expectations by the most in two years. Are eurozone equities still a buy, despite all this?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  I -- I think there are two things going on. One is that the euro has been quite strong against the dollar. I think we're around 1.23 at the moment for that -- is proving a headwind for what I call \"global Europe,\" so that's sort of globally-facing European exporters, that's - that is a bit of a challenge.   </p><p>      So I -- I think that -- that can be a bit of a headwind. And also, there -- there's this idea of hedonic adaptation, which is -- whereby, you know, the data's so -- has been so relentlessly good that people have just got used to it.   </p><p>      So unless the data remains, you know, amazing and continues to surprise, you're going to get this rollover in the indices. It doesn't mean that in absolute terms, that the data is poor.   </p><p>      You know, The PMIs are still firmly expansionary. But, yes, they've come off a little bit recently. But that's maybe one or two data points, so I don't think we can draw conclusions quite yet.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Julian, one of the points of discussion that was meant to happen at the E.U. leader (ph) summit but has sort of been pushed back somewhat, is this transitional deal. Does that change anything in the way you look at the U.K. as an investment destination?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. So I -- I'm probably -- I've been quite optimistic so far this morning. On Brexit, I think, I'm -- I'm a bit more pessimistic, and particularly around this -- this conference that's happening today.   </p><p>      I think the Irish still have the ability to pull the plug on the transition deal. So we have this sort of run-up in sterling, sort of increased optimism that we're going to get transition.   </p><p>      But unless the Irish are happy around the border arrangement, they could still pull the plug. I mean, that would be the nuclear option for them, given that both governments got a stake in the Good Friday Agreement.   </p><p>      But -- but it is possible. I mean, there are red lines here around, you know, around a hard border. And we have this backstop idea, but I don't think the U.K.'s going to accept that, and I don't think that the DUP will either.   </p><p>      So that -- that is still an area of concern. In terms of investments, we try and avoid the U.K., not so much because of Brexit but we think the opportunities are better elsewhere, for example emerging markets.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  What would make you change your mind, Julian? What would change the dial for you on the Brexit conversation? Are you looking for, actually, the U.K. government to change its stance and decide to stay in the Customs Union? Would that be a game-changer? Or do you just need to see the existing plan delivered against? What -- what's the priority?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. I -- I think it would be -- it would be what we call \"BINO,\" Brexit in Name Only. You know, so that's a -- the sort of latest acronym doing the rounds. But I think some kind of Customs Union is (ph) at (ph) a very soft Brexit, where it's just a -- a kind of nominal \"Yes, we'll tick the box that we are outside the European Union, but in every other way we are essentially still in.\"  </p><p>      I think that's really the only way to sort of preserve growth and access to -- to the markets that -- that, certainly, the financial community is looking for. But I think at the moment, we're headed for something probably a little harder.  </p><p>      I mean, there have been signs from, certainly, the hard Brexiteers, such as (INAUDIBLE) and Rees-Mogg, for example that, you know, there are signs of pragmatism, that he can't get everything that -- that he wants. Not that he represents the hard Brexit camp on his own, but there are signs that this could be a compromise.   </p><p>      So we're probably not going to have the hardest Brexit. It's -- at the moment, it looks like we're -- we're set on a middle course. But it's still going to be damaging for -- for growth in -- in the medium term for the U.K.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  What do asset allocation decisions look like around U.K. assets then, at GAM? When you talk about this, Julian. You said you're pretty negative on the Brexit story. But which of the assets that look -- look better than others, I suppose?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. So I mean, it's not -- we're underweight, the U.K., not so much because of Brexit. Because, of course, there's this inverse relationship with sterling and the FTSE. So we're -- if -- if there was catastrophes, sterling would fall and the FTSE would -- would conversely rise.   </p><p>      And -- and we can't get a handle on -- on where sterling is going. It's very, very hard to predict how the currency is going to behave. 2018 saw sterling appreciate, and that was kind of quite unexpected. So we -- we try and stay neutral around sterling.   </p><p>      And then in terms of the equity market, we're underweight. But that's really because we -- we just think there are better opportunities elsewhere, such as emerging markets. Particularly now that we've had these sort of three, four percent sell-offs overnight. You know, across Asia.   </p><p>      I think that makes emerging markets very, very attractive. They're already trading at around 70 percent of the valuation of global equities, and now they're probably even cheaper.   </p><p>      So E.M., I think, is where the future lies. And -- and we've come to see almost quasi-permanent overweight allocations to that area. I mean, that -- that is where the growth is now, it's where the growth is in the long term.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  OK. Tying back nicely -- tying back nicely, Julian, to our top story, whether these market sell-offs, these equity sell-offs are overdone (ph). Thank you very much.  </p><p>      Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us here on the program.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, is still with us.   </p><p>      Again, difficult for the IPOs, I guess. But looking at the tax sector more broadly, then, Julian, it's been, of course, a fascinating week in the Facebook story.   </p><p>      Broadening that out, would it be -- to put it too strongly, to talk about a real threat to the business models? Almost an existential threat to any business models in tech that rely on the sale of data.   </p><p>      And I know Facebook doesn't only rely on that, it relies on other things like advertising. But any tech stock that relies only on the sale of data, does it have to worry more about regulatory risk now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. I -- I think there is the possibility of increased regulation. And I think Mark Zuckerberg gave a very sort of guarded invitation to -- for increased regulation, although I think it was more for the advertisers than for his own company.   </p><p>      But I think more generally, social -- the sort of social media tech is having something of a tobacco moment here, where -- whereby the business model is kind of being revealed to -- to the users.   </p><p>      I mean, the users, I think, are starting to realize that they are not the client. That, actually, it's the advertisers that are the clients, and in fact the user is paying for this apparently free service, you know, with the currency of their privacy and their data, which is then being, sort of -- they don't have control over it once they've handed it over.   </p><p>      So I -- I think it actually boosts the case for active management around technology. You know, perhaps starting to look very carefully around social media companies and -- and wondering whether, you know, the business model is sustainable, or at least is correctly priced.  </p><p>      And perhaps focusing instead on what I call the \"second-line technology sectors,\" such as storage and automation. And, I guess, Dropbox, at a push, falls into the storage category.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  And perhaps you look at other -- other things, like hardware. Are you interested in tech hardware at this time, or perhaps other geographies? We were looking -- talking about the Tencent earnings earlier on this week. I mean, perhaps there is less of a regulatory threat in other parts of the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. And I -- I think also, the fact that we've had this sell-off in Asia actually makes some of the -- some of the Asian, you know, companies, particularly attractive.   </p><p>      I mean, in -- I mean, without getting stock-specific, in the U.S. you have these sort of FANG (ph) giants who are considered unassailable. But I think it's the case that a lot of the Asian companies have -- have sort of been holding off competing with them because of the anti-Chinese rhetoric that's coming out of Washington.  </p><p>      So at some point, maybe if you're a long-term -- very, very long-term investor, this is a good time to buy, see through the Trump administration, then these guys start to compete against the FANGs (ph), that could be a very interesting opportunity.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Yes. Julian -- I mean, and also we don't yet know exactly how GDPR, the advent of that in the E.U. might impact tech stocks globally as well.   </p><p>      But away from regulation, the trade story. Does that pose any concern around threat -- around tech, particularly in the U.S.?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Yes. Well, there's -- I guess there's the intellectual property issue. And we've also seen that the block -- the blocking of the deal between Qualcomm and Broadcom, although technically I think that's (ph) Singaporean rather than Chinese. So I think that's always something to bear in mind.   </p><p>      But what interests me is the fact that Asian tech at the moment is looking, you know, it's four percent cheaper today than it was, potentially, yesterday.   </p><p>      So I think that could be interesting, especially given that, in the U.S., it's really tech that's driven the market up all this way. And now that has been reversed. So it just makes Asia look that bit more attractive versus the U.S.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Yes. To that point, I've got a chart here, 516, in terms of the weight of tech. And this chart also shows -- shows the weight of financials, incidentally, of the S&amp;P 500. Does that make you less positive on U.S. stocks overall? Or is there another narrative that means you're still bullish on them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  Well it -- it makes me think, actually, that -- that, if anything, you've got to be selective with tech. But actually, financials are the opportunity here. I think we were just commenting that the 10-year yield has not fallen as much as expected. And financials tend to do pretty well if you get a -- a rising 10-year yield and a -- and a sort of falling short-term.   </p><p>      Now we haven't had that so much yet, but the -- I think the backdrop's in place. Jerome Powell has talked about, you know, inflation not being the threat that everyone thinks it is, which suggests that the short-term should stay low.   </p><p>      Meanwhile, growth is improving in America. We've seen the ISM Manufacturing. That'll push the 10-year higher. This should be good for financial stocks.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  So it's deepening (ph). Right -- Anna.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EDWARDS</emphasis>:  Julian -- Julian, here in Brussels, the leaders gathered yesterday and one of the things they did do was cast some doubt over the European Commission's plan for a three percent revenue tax on some of these big tech companies.   </p><p>      That would -- would that be quite an unprecedented move, to see revenues taxed in that way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOWARD</emphasis>:  I think it would. And I think it would be very self-interested. I mean, the problem is that Europe simply doesn't have the -- you know, the tech giants that -- that the U.S. does.   </p><p>      And I think this is part of the reason that European equities have this quasi-permanent discount against world equities. That there is no technology representation. Whereas in the U.S., obviously, it's a very big part of it.   </p><p>      So I think the Europeans need to be a bit careful about seeming to be anti-competitive, and it -- well, in fact, they didn't even have a tech industry to protect -- in the way that the U.S. does. So I -- I think it's a good move, if they -- if they roll back from that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CEHIC</emphasis>:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.

Of course, you  could argue, as some of it is knee-jerk at this point.  I just want to  quickly take you to a chart which is a great map, 7385, showing the  exemptions so far globally, and from the U.S. tariffs.</p><p>Japan, notably absent from there.  We have seen Japanese equities lead the  losses overnight.  How bad will things have to get for this sell-off to be  sustained?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think they would have to get a lot worse, and I don't think they  will get a lot worse.  So I think much of this is actually symbolic, and I  think it's really about Trump appealing to the -- to his base, actually.</p><p>I mean, this was a -- a campaign promise, that he was going to do something  about sort of undercutting, you know, Chinese imports and the way that that  was undercutting U.S. industry.  I think he's made that sort of symbolic  gesture now.</p><p>And it's pretty small-scale, actually.  I mean, this is -- this is not  going to be -- have a big impact on growth.  I think most of the estimates  I've seen are about a 0.1 percent impact on U.S. GDP growth.</p><p>So it's all about symbolism.  It's in line with, if you read \"The Art of  the Deal,\" it's in line with sort of making a big hoo-ha and then bringing  people to the negotiating table.</p><p>So I think the market reaction, probably so far, is already a little bit  sort of over -- overdone.</p><p>CEHIC:  Right.  And we have seen some key technicals.  I can bring up a  chart to show you that later.  But we are only on day one.  What would need  to happen where you actually start to become concerned and think that the  sell-off could be more sustained?</p><p>We heard Tom Mackenzie, there, point to some of the extra measures that  China could take.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I, well, I think it would have to be much more broad- based.  I think it would have to be more -- more than just steel and  aluminum.  It would have to be across the board.  It would have to be much  more punitive.  And then there would have to be immediate escalation.  The  exemptions would have to be rolled back.</p><p>I mean, I suppose technically the exemptions are on a temporary basis. Some  of them are sort of, \"We'll have this until -- this exemption until we have  a conversation.\"  So it could be that when that conversation happens, the  exemption is, in fact, repealed.</p><p>So it -- it could, in theory, get a -- get a whole lot worse.  But I would  agree with the analyst that you quoted, that actually this is quite  moderate so far.  And -- and my sense is that it will remain pretty  moderate, and that this will blow over and the news cycle will move on.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Yes.  I mean, good morning, Julian.   Listening to Trump's press conference yesterday, and actually listening to  what Wilbur Ross had to say.  He finished with some quite brief comments,  saying \"We'll end up negotiating, not fighting about this,\" were his words.</p><p>And then also, another reason to be cheerful if you -- if you like  globalization, I suppose.  He did talk about the -- the U.S. is going to  challenge -- or -- or the government talked about how the U.S. is going to  challenge China licensing practices at the WTO.</p><p>So some signs, at least, that the aim here is to get to negotiating table,  and also that some of the well-trodden routes and paths to resolve these  disputes may still be used.  Some of those four (ph) that we thought were  cast aside by the Trump administration could still be used, such as the  WTO.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yeah.  I mean, I absolutely agree.  I -- I think the aim, here, is  not to damage U.S. GDP growth.  I mean, the -- the administration has  quoted the stock market, GDP growth and unemployment relentlessly since  early 2017, as sort of signs of its success in economic policy.</p><p>And I think deep down, they realize that a concerted trade war, an all-out  trade war, would be absolutely catastrophic.  You know, surely the memory  of the -- of the 1920s and the way that trade tariffs were increased by six  percent, just at the wrong moment, that sent the U.S. into depression -- I  think people are still conscious of that.</p><p>So I can't imagine that even this administration would want to risk those - - those kind of milestones that it's been marking out so -- so clearly over  the last 18 months or so.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And, Julian, we heard Trump also talk about how this is partly  being driven by his desire to reduce the trade deficit with China.  What  would -- I mean, it -- clearly, a recession in the United States and  reducing U.S. consumer spending would -- would do something to go along  that route, but he doesn't want to do that, I'm sure.</p><p>But -- so what would bring down the trade deficit between the United States  and China?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I -- I guess an all-out trade war would, where -- whereby  Chinese exports into the U.S. is -- is seriously constrained.</p><p>But I -- I think, actually, it's your first point that is the most obvious  for bringing down that trade deficit, that actually there's a recession and  the U.S. consumer's propensity to consume is based on imports.  So as  consumers feel wealthier, imports tend to get sucked in.  So it would be  one of those two things, neither of which is particularly desirable.</p><p>So actually, for me, the trade deficit is, in fact, a kind of indicator of  economic health.  And I don't think we should target it as this sort of  boogeyman that needs to be corrected.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, just got to break a headline crossing the Bloomberg.  The  Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 4.3 percent, extending its losses.</p><p>And at this point, if you're a Bloomberg client I just want to draw your  attention to the TLIV blog on the Bloomberg that is tracking all the latest  on this day one of a potential trade war, including all the market  reaction.  And, crucially, some of the key levels you want to watch in  these equity indices over in Asia.</p><p>We've already seen the MSCI Asia Pacific Index drop below the 50- and 100- day moving average, and also we've seen Japanese equities drop below the  200-day moving average.</p><p>But I just want to still show this chart, Julian, which is 5781, and it's  the risk-on, risk-off index.  Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch did a survey  recently, showing that even though investors are really concerned about  things like trade, stagflation, they're still long-risk assets.  Why?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I think risk assets still represent the best risk-adjusted  return versus Treasury bonds.  I mean, the equity risk premium at the  moment in the United States is two points -- about 2.6 to 2.8 percent.</p><p>So you are getting 2.8 percent more from holding stocks than you are from  the risk-free rate in treasuries.  That's attractive.  And history suggests  that a risk premium of about 2.8 percent goes on to give you a return of  around six to eight percent from equities over the following two years.   That's not a bad -- that's not a bad outcome.</p><p>CEHIC:  All right.  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM,  stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, still with  us on set in London.</p><p>Julian, when you look at the latest changes, we've got concern around  protectionism writ large across these markets today.  I guess the last  thing investors needed was another concern, and that might be geopolitics.</p><p>Do these moves increase your concern that the hawk of hawks, as Eurasia  (ph) calls him, will bring more geopolitical risk?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I mean, John Bolton wrote this paper, didn't he?  I think it  was a couple of years ago.  \"The Legal Case for Attacking North Korea.\"  So  we kind of see what his -- what his -- his view is.  You've got to --  you've got to set that off against Trump's sort of desire to do a deal.</p><p>And I think the idea of sitting down with Kim Jong is actually going to be  so tempting for the -- for the U.S. president.  You know, to be able to  pull off this sort of grand master stroke.</p><p>So I think even though there are more hawks in the administration now, I  think Trump won't sort of -- resist the temptation to sit down and try and  pull off something, incredible deal around North Korea.</p><p>Now if that fails, we'll -- we'll have to see.  But I think at the moment,  it's not obvious that just having John Bolton in there is -- is going to  mean a -- a kind of cooling of relations with North Korea.</p><p>If anything, things have gone quite well recently, and I think Donald Trump  will want to sit down with -- with Kim Jong and try -- try and pull  something off.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 2.8 percent.   Does it go lower from here on these concerns?</p><p>HOWARD:  There -- there may be some short-term re-rating of growth, but I  think the reason that the Treasury yield hasn't gone lower -- and this was  something that we were talking about earlier -- I think it's because a lot  of growth has (ph) priced into it.</p><p>It's not so much that the break-even is -- is moving, it's not so much an  inflation change although that is, partly, a factor because of what Jerome  Powell said about inflation.  That there is no inflation threat.  But it's  just still a lot of growth priced into that yield.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes, and I'm so glad we showed this chart that you highlighted  there as well, highlighted that point.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC:  Let's now bring in Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at  GAM.</p><p>So, Julian, we've seen the reaction in Asian equities.  We'll find out, in  about an hour and a half, how European equities are going to react to all  this.</p><p>In this potential global trade war, how much does Europe actually have to - - have to lose economically?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think it could be significant, but I'm -- I'm very much  encouraged by that initial exemption that's been granted, although it only  lasts for -- it's a temporary one.  But I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by  that.  So I think -- I think something will be -- something will be sorted  out around that.</p><p>But I think, potentially, it -- you know, worst case, it could be very,  very significant but I just don't think that's going to be the reality.   I'm very encouraged that an exemption has been granted in the first  instance.</p><p>CEHIC:  What sort of impact might we see on the euro in all this?  We've  seen the yen bid, questions over whether it could go to 100.  Does the  dollar weaken and therefore the euro strengthens on the back of this and  weighs on European inflation --</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  -- I mean, what's the dynamic here?</p><p>HOWARD:  Oh, it could -- I mean, it could even be the other way around --</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>HOWARD:  -- but actually, if -- if we have a really big trade war and a  massive crisis, economic crisis, you know, the -- the dollar could become a  haven currency.</p><p>But it -- you know, it used to have that status but it sort of kind of lost  out to -- to the Japanese yen.  But that could -- that could resume again.   So potentially, you could get euro weakening from this point.  Which,  ironically, would actually be quite helpful for the eurozone's exporters  and, indeed, the European equity market.</p><p>So there's a lot -- there's a lot of factors swirling around at the moment.   So it's very difficult to make a kind of clear currency call on -- on euro- dollar.  But generally, euro strength has been a bit of a headwind for  European equities.  So potentially an unwind of that could -- could be  helpful, but for the wrong reasons.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian, we heard from Mario Draghi, he was here briefing E.U.  leaders yesterday.  He talked about four risks.  And one of them -- and in  fact, the top one -- was around protectionisms.  And it's clearly very much  on the Central Bank's radar.  Protectionism is the biggest risk to the  European economy.</p><p>He also talks about less reliance on international forums that have been  used previously, of course.</p><p>But in -- in terms of the size and scope of this -- this fear or this risk,  the fact that Draghi puts that at the top at number one, suggests that it's  something that the ECB is watching incredibly closely.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  And I think that's actually potentially encouraging for --  for European stocks.  I mean, it means that the interest rates in -- within  the eurozone are going to be kept on the floor.  I think that the language  is -- was fairly dovish at the last conference.</p><p>He cited this risk, he recognizes that the Q.E. program's going to end in  September, but he -- he was at pains to say that that doesn't mean that  interest rates are going to be the next step.</p><p>So rates will stay low and I think this -- any fear of a trade war is going  to keep rates even -- even sort of more permanently low than -- than we --  than market currently anticipates.  So that could be good for equities.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Could be good (ph) (INAUDIBLE).  Interesting story on the  Bloomberg, also, around productivity in Europe, Julian.  As some of our  colleagues writing about how some of the measures that have been taken by  European governments are actually driving up productivity that -- labor  that was on the sidelines is now coming back into the workforce.</p><p>And so as a result, Europe is actually discovering more slack, which means  it can continue growing without creating inflation.</p><p>Now, while some of that might sound like very good news, as, of course,  that makes the ECB's job more difficult when it continues to try and  generate inflation.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I mean, we -- we talk about the Phillips curve challenge  (ph) within the U.S., don't we?  But Europe isn't even there yet.  So we  haven't even tested the Phillips curve in Europe.</p><p>You know, unemployment is -- is just under, I think, 10 percent at this  point.  So Europe can actually sustain a sort of Goldilocks scenario,  whereby growth continues to improve but there's no inflation.</p><p>Yes, that might be frustrating for -- for the ECB, but I think actually  it's -- it's probably quite a good state of affairs.  And then we can sort  of resume the conversation, I guess, when unemployment gets to the sort of  six percent, five percent level.</p><p>But I think in the meantime, there's quite a nice sort of Goldilocks-type  path for Europe, whereby growth improves but there's no -- no price  pressure at the same time.</p><p>CEHIC:  But Julian, what about the fact that we've seen some softness in  recent eurozone PMIs for two months in a row, now?  And not only that, but  if I take you to this chart, 8431, the economic surprise index, the Citi  (ph) economic surprise index actually undershooting expectations by the  most in two years.  Are eurozone equities still a buy, despite all this?</p><p>HOWARD:  I -- I think there are two things going on.  One is that the euro  has been quite strong against the dollar.  I think we're around 1.23 at the  moment for that -- is proving a headwind for what I call \"global Europe,\"  so that's sort of globally-facing European exporters, that's - that is a  bit of a challenge.</p><p>So I -- I think that -- that can be a bit of a headwind.  And also, there - - there's this idea of hedonic adaptation, which is -- whereby, you know,  the data's so -- has been so relentlessly good that people have just got  used to it.</p><p>So unless the data remains, you know, amazing and continues to surprise,  you're going to get this rollover in the indices.  It doesn't mean that in  absolute terms, that the data is poor.</p><p>You know, The PMIs are still firmly expansionary.  But, yes, they've come  off a little bit recently.  But that's maybe one or two data points, so I  don't think we can draw conclusions quite yet.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, one of the points of discussion that was meant to happen at  the E.U. leader (ph) summit but has sort of been pushed back somewhat, is  this transitional deal.  Does that change anything in the way you look at  the U.K. as an investment destination?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  So I -- I'm probably -- I've been quite optimistic so far  this morning.  On Brexit, I think, I'm -- I'm a bit more pessimistic, and  particularly around this -- this conference that's happening today.</p><p>I think the Irish still have the ability to pull the plug on the transition  deal.  So we have this sort of run-up in sterling, sort of increased  optimism that we're going to get transition.</p><p>But unless the Irish are happy around the border arrangement, they could  still pull the plug.  I mean, that would be the nuclear option for them,  given that both governments got a stake in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>But -- but it is possible.  I mean, there are red lines here around, you  know, around a hard border.  And we have this backstop idea, but I don't  think the U.K.'s going to accept that, and I don't think that the DUP will  either.</p><p>So that -- that is still an area of concern.  In terms of investments, we  try and avoid the U.K., not so much because of Brexit but we think the  opportunities are better elsewhere, for example emerging markets.</p><p>EDWARDS:  What would make you change your mind, Julian?  What would change  the dial for you on the Brexit conversation?  Are you looking for,  actually, the U.K. government to change its stance and decide to stay in  the Customs Union?  Would that be a game-changer?  Or do you just need to  see the existing plan delivered against?  What -- what's the priority?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I think it would be -- it would be what we call \"BINO,\"  Brexit in Name Only.  You know, so that's a -- the sort of latest acronym  doing the rounds.  But I think some kind of Customs Union is (ph) at (ph) a  very soft Brexit, where it's just a -- a kind of nominal \"Yes, we'll tick  the box that we are outside the European Union, but in every other way we  are essentially still in.\"</p><p>I think that's really the only way to sort of preserve growth and access to  -- to the markets that -- that, certainly, the financial community is  looking for.  But I think at the moment, we're headed for something  probably a little harder.</p><p>I mean, there have been signs from, certainly, the hard Brexiteers, such as  (INAUDIBLE) and Rees-Mogg, for example that, you know, there are signs of  pragmatism, that he can't get everything that -- that he wants.  Not that  he represents the hard Brexit camp on his own, but there are signs that  this could be a compromise.</p><p>So we're probably not going to have the hardest Brexit.  It's -- at the  moment, it looks like we're -- we're set on a middle course.  But it's  still going to be damaging for -- for growth in -- in the medium term for  the U.K.</p><p>EDWARDS:  What do asset allocation decisions look like around U.K. assets  then, at GAM?  When you talk about this, Julian. You said you're pretty  negative on the Brexit story.  But which of the assets that look -- look  better than others, I suppose?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  So I mean, it's not -- we're underweight, the U.K., not so  much because of Brexit.  Because, of course, there's this inverse  relationship with sterling and the FTSE.  So we're -- if -- if there was  catastrophes, sterling would fall and the FTSE would -- would conversely  rise.</p><p>And -- and we can't get a handle on -- on where sterling is going.  It's  very, very hard to predict how the currency is going to behave.  2018 saw  sterling appreciate, and that was kind of quite unexpected.  So we -- we  try and stay neutral around sterling.</p><p>And then in terms of the equity market, we're underweight.  But that's  really because we -- we just think there are better opportunities  elsewhere, such as emerging markets.  Particularly now that we've had these  sort of three, four percent sell-offs overnight.  You know, across Asia.</p><p>I think that makes emerging markets very, very attractive.  They're already  trading at around 70 percent of the valuation of global equities, and now  they're probably even cheaper.</p><p>So E.M., I think, is where the future lies.  And -- and we've come to see  almost quasi-permanent overweight allocations to that area.  I mean, that - - that is where the growth is now, it's where the growth is in the long  term.</p><p>EDWARDS:  OK.  Tying back nicely -- tying back nicely, Julian, to our top  story, whether these market sell-offs, these equity sell-offs are overdone  (ph).  Thank you very much.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us here on  the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, is still  with us.</p><p>Again, difficult for the IPOs, I guess.  But looking at the tax sector more  broadly, then, Julian, it's been, of course, a fascinating week in the  Facebook story.</p><p>Broadening that out, would it be -- to put it too strongly, to talk about a  real threat to the business models?  Almost an existential threat to any  business models in tech that rely on the sale of data.</p><p>And I know Facebook doesn't only rely on that, it relies on other things  like advertising.  But any tech stock that relies only on the sale of data,  does it have to worry more about regulatory risk now?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I think there is the possibility of increased  regulation.  And I think Mark Zuckerberg gave a very sort of guarded  invitation to -- for increased regulation, although I think it was more for  the advertisers than for his own company.</p><p>But I think more generally, social -- the sort of social media tech is  having something of a tobacco moment here, where -- whereby the business  model is kind of being revealed to -- to the users.</p><p>I mean, the users, I think, are starting to realize that they are not the  client.  That, actually, it's the advertisers that are the clients, and in  fact the user is paying for this apparently free service, you know, with  the currency of their privacy and their data, which is then being, sort of  -- they don't have control over it once they've handed it over.</p><p>So I -- I think it actually boosts the case for active management around  technology.  You know, perhaps starting to look very carefully around  social media companies and -- and wondering whether, you know, the business  model is sustainable, or at least is correctly priced.</p><p>And perhaps focusing instead on what I call the \"second-line technology  sectors,\" such as storage and automation.  And, I guess, Dropbox, at a  push, falls into the storage category.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And perhaps you look at other -- other things, like hardware.   Are you interested in tech hardware at this time, or perhaps other  geographies?  We were looking -- talking about the Tencent earnings earlier  on this week.  I mean, perhaps there is less of a regulatory threat in  other parts of the world.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  And I -- I think also, the fact that we've had this sell-off  in Asia actually makes some of the -- some of the Asian, you know,  companies, particularly attractive.</p><p>I mean, in -- I mean, without getting stock-specific, in the U.S. you have  these sort of FANG (ph) giants who are considered unassailable.  But I  think it's the case that a lot of the Asian companies have -- have sort of  been holding off competing with them because of the anti-Chinese rhetoric  that's coming out of Washington.</p><p>So at some point, maybe if you're a long-term -- very, very long-term  investor, this is a good time to buy, see through the Trump administration,  then these guys start to compete against the FANGs (ph), that could be a  very interesting opportunity.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes.  Julian -- I mean, and also we don't yet know exactly how  GDPR, the advent of that in the E.U. might impact tech stocks globally as  well.</p><p>But away from regulation, the trade story.  Does that pose any concern  around threat -- around tech, particularly in the U.S.?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  Well, there's -- I guess there's the intellectual property  issue.  And we've also seen that the block -- the blocking of the deal  between Qualcomm and Broadcom, although technically I think that's (ph)  Singaporean rather than Chinese.  So I think that's always something to  bear in mind.</p><p>But what interests me is the fact that Asian tech at the moment is looking,  you know, it's four percent cheaper today than it was, potentially,  yesterday.</p><p>So I think that could be interesting, especially given that, in the U.S.,  it's really tech that's driven the market up all this way.  And now that  has been reversed.  So it just makes Asia look that bit more attractive  versus the U.S.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  To that point, I've got a chart here, 516, in terms of the  weight of tech.  And this chart also shows -- shows the weight of  financials, incidentally, of the S&amp;P 500.  Does that make you less positive  on U.S. stocks overall?  Or is there another narrative that means you're  still bullish on them?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well it -- it makes me think, actually, that -- that, if anything,  you've got to be selective with tech.  But actually, financials are the  opportunity here.  I think we were just commenting that the 10-year yield  has not fallen as much as expected.  And financials tend to do pretty well  if you get a -- a rising 10-year yield and a -- and a sort of falling  short-term.</p><p>Now we haven't had that so much yet, but the -- I think the backdrop's in  place.  Jerome Powell has talked about, you know, inflation not being the  threat that everyone thinks it is, which suggests that the short-term  should stay low.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth is improving in America.  We've seen the ISM  Manufacturing.  That'll push the 10-year higher.  This should be good for  financial stocks.</p><p>CEHIC:  So it's deepening (ph).  Right -- Anna.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian -- Julian, here in Brussels, the leaders gathered  yesterday and one of the things they did do was cast some doubt over the  European Commission's plan for a three percent revenue tax on some of these  big tech companies.</p><p>That would -- would that be quite an unprecedented move, to see revenues  taxed in that way?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think it would.  And I think it would be very self-interested.   I mean, the problem is that Europe simply doesn't have the -- you know, the  tech giants that -- that the U.S. does.</p><p>And I think this is part of the reason that European equities have this  quasi-permanent discount against world equities.  That there is no  technology representation.  Whereas in the U.S., obviously, it's a very big  part of it.</p><p>So I think the Europeans need to be a bit careful about seeming to be anti- competitive, and it -- well, in fact, they didn't even have a tech industry  to protect -- in the way that the U.S. does.  So I -- I think it's a good  move, if they -- if they roll back from that.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.  Thank you so  much for being with us.</p><p>And Julian continues the conversation with us at 7:30 am U.K. time, on  radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Of course, you could argue, as some of it is knee-jerk at this point. I just want to quickly take you to a chart which is a great map, 7385, showing the exemptions so far globally, and from the U.S. tariffs.</p><p>Japan, notably absent from there. We have seen Japanese equities lead the losses overnight. How bad will things have to get for this sell-off to be sustained?</p><p>HOWARD: I think they would have to get a lot worse, and I don't think they will get a lot worse. So I think much of this is actually symbolic, and I think it's really about Trump appealing to the -- to his base, actually.</p><p>I mean, this was a -- a campaign promise, that he was going to do something about sort of undercutting, you know, Chinese imports and the way that that was undercutting U.S. industry. I think he's made that sort of symbolic gesture now.</p><p>And it's pretty small-scale, actually. I mean, this is -- this is not going to be -- have a big impact on growth. I think most of the estimates I've seen are about a 0.1 percent impact on U.S. GDP growth.</p><p>So it's all about symbolism. It's in line with, if you read \"The Art of the Deal,\" it's in line with sort of making a big hoo-ha and then bringing people to the negotiating table.</p><p>So I think the market reaction, probably so far, is already a little bit sort of over -- overdone.</p><p>CEHIC: Right. And we have seen some key technicals. I can bring up a chart to show you that later. But we are only on day one. What would need to happen where you actually start to become concerned and think that the sell-off could be more sustained?</p><p>We heard Tom Mackenzie, there, point to some of the extra measures that China could take.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I, well, I think it would have to be much more broad- based. I think it would have to be more -- more than just steel and aluminum. It would have to be across the board. It would have to be much more punitive. And then there would have to be immediate escalation. The exemptions would have to be rolled back.</p><p>I mean, I suppose technically the exemptions are on a temporary basis. Some of them are sort of, \"We'll have this until -- this exemption until we have a conversation.\" So it could be that when that conversation happens, the exemption is, in fact, repealed.</p><p>So it -- it could, in theory, get a -- get a whole lot worse. But I would agree with the analyst that you quoted, that actually this is quite moderate so far. And -- and my sense is that it will remain pretty moderate, and that this will blow over and the news cycle will move on.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. I mean, good morning, Julian. Listening to Trump's press conference yesterday, and actually listening to what Wilbur Ross had to say. He finished with some quite brief comments, saying \"We'll end up negotiating, not fighting about this,\" were his words.</p><p>And then also, another reason to be cheerful if you -- if you like globalization, I suppose. He did talk about the -- the U.S. is going to challenge -- or -- or the government talked about how the U.S. is going to challenge China licensing practices at the WTO.</p><p>So some signs, at least, that the aim here is to get to negotiating table, and also that some of the well-trodden routes and paths to resolve these disputes may still be used. Some of those four (ph) that we thought were cast aside by the Trump administration could still be used, such as the WTO.</p><p>HOWARD: Yeah. I mean, I absolutely agree. I -- I think the aim, here, is not to damage U.S. GDP growth. I mean, the -- the administration has quoted the stock market, GDP growth and unemployment relentlessly since early 2017, as sort of signs of its success in economic policy.</p><p>And I think deep down, they realize that a concerted trade war, an all-out trade war, would be absolutely catastrophic. You know, surely the memory of the -- of the 1920s and the way that trade tariffs were increased by six percent, just at the wrong moment, that sent the U.S. into depression -- I think people are still conscious of that.</p><p>So I can't imagine that even this administration would want to risk those - - those kind of milestones that it's been marking out so -- so clearly over the last 18 months or so.</p><p>EDWARDS: And, Julian, we heard Trump also talk about how this is partly being driven by his desire to reduce the trade deficit with China. What would -- I mean, it -- clearly, a recession in the United States and reducing U.S. consumer spending would -- would do something to go along that route, but he doesn't want to do that, I'm sure.</p><p>But -- so what would bring down the trade deficit between the United States and China?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I -- I guess an all-out trade war would, where -- whereby Chinese exports into the U.S. is -- is seriously constrained.</p><p>But I -- I think, actually, it's your first point that is the most obvious for bringing down that trade deficit, that actually there's a recession and the U.S. consumer's propensity to consume is based on imports. So as consumers feel wealthier, imports tend to get sucked in. So it would be one of those two things, neither of which is particularly desirable.</p><p>So actually, for me, the trade deficit is, in fact, a kind of indicator of economic health. And I don't think we should target it as this sort of boogeyman that needs to be corrected.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, just got to break a headline crossing the Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 4.3 percent, extending its losses.</p><p>And at this point, if you're a Bloomberg client I just want to draw your attention to the TLIV blog on the Bloomberg that is tracking all the latest on this day one of a potential trade war, including all the market reaction. And, crucially, some of the key levels you want to watch in these equity indices over in Asia.</p><p>We've already seen the MSCI Asia Pacific Index drop below the 50- and 100- day moving average, and also we've seen Japanese equities drop below the 200-day moving average.</p><p>But I just want to still show this chart, Julian, which is 5781, and it's the risk-on, risk-off index. Bank of America Merrill Lynch did a survey recently, showing that even though investors are really concerned about things like trade, stagflation, they're still long-risk assets. Why?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I think risk assets still represent the best risk-adjusted return versus Treasury bonds. I mean, the equity risk premium at the moment in the United States is two points -- about 2.6 to 2.8 percent.</p><p>So you are getting 2.8 percent more from holding stocks than you are from the risk-free rate in treasuries. That's attractive. And history suggests that a risk premium of about 2.8 percent goes on to give you a return of around six to eight percent from equities over the following two years. That's not a bad -- that's not a bad outcome.</p><p>CEHIC: All right. Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, still with us on set in London.</p><p>Julian, when you look at the latest changes, we've got concern around protectionism writ large across these markets today. I guess the last thing investors needed was another concern, and that might be geopolitics.</p><p>Do these moves increase your concern that the hawk of hawks, as Eurasia (ph) calls him, will bring more geopolitical risk?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I mean, John Bolton wrote this paper, didn't he? I think it was a couple of years ago. \"The Legal Case for Attacking North Korea.\" So we kind of see what his -- what his -- his view is. You've got to -- you've got to set that off against Trump's sort of desire to do a deal.</p><p>And I think the idea of sitting down with Kim Jong is actually going to be so tempting for the -- for the U.S. president. You know, to be able to pull off this sort of grand master stroke.</p><p>So I think even though there are more hawks in the administration now, I think Trump won't sort of -- resist the temptation to sit down and try and pull off something, incredible deal around North Korea.</p><p>Now if that fails, we'll -- we'll have to see. But I think at the moment, it's not obvious that just having John Bolton in there is -- is going to mean a -- a kind of cooling of relations with North Korea.</p><p>If anything, things have gone quite well recently, and I think Donald Trump will want to sit down with -- with Kim Jong and try -- try and pull something off.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 2.8 percent. Does it go lower from here on these concerns?</p><p>HOWARD: There -- there may be some short-term re-rating of growth, but I think the reason that the Treasury yield hasn't gone lower -- and this was something that we were talking about earlier -- I think it's because a lot of growth has (ph) priced into it.</p><p>It's not so much that the break-even is -- is moving, it's not so much an inflation change although that is, partly, a factor because of what Jerome Powell said about inflation. That there is no inflation threat. But it's just still a lot of growth priced into that yield.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes, and I'm so glad we showed this chart that you highlighted there as well, highlighted that point.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: Let's now bring in Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.</p><p>So, Julian, we've seen the reaction in Asian equities. We'll find out, in about an hour and a half, how European equities are going to react to all this.</p><p>In this potential global trade war, how much does Europe actually have to - - have to lose economically?</p><p>HOWARD: I think it could be significant, but I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that initial exemption that's been granted, although it only lasts for -- it's a temporary one. But I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that. So I think -- I think something will be -- something will be sorted out around that.</p><p>But I think, potentially, it -- you know, worst case, it could be very, very significant but I just don't think that's going to be the reality. I'm very encouraged that an exemption has been granted in the first instance.</p><p>CEHIC: What sort of impact might we see on the euro in all this? We've seen the yen bid, questions over whether it could go to 100. Does the dollar weaken and therefore the euro strengthens on the back of this and weighs on European inflation --</p><p>HOWARD: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- I mean, what's the dynamic here?</p><p>HOWARD: Oh, it could -- I mean, it could even be the other way around --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>HOWARD: -- but actually, if -- if we have a really big trade war and a massive crisis, economic crisis, you know, the -- the dollar could become a haven currency.</p><p>But it -- you know, it used to have that status but it sort of kind of lost out to -- to the Japanese yen. But that could -- that could resume again. So potentially, you could get euro weakening from this point. Which, ironically, would actually be quite helpful for the eurozone's exporters and, indeed, the European equity market.</p><p>So there's a lot -- there's a lot of factors swirling around at the moment. So it's very difficult to make a kind of clear currency call on -- on euro- dollar. But generally, euro strength has been a bit of a headwind for European equities. So potentially an unwind of that could -- could be helpful, but for the wrong reasons.</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian, we heard from Mario Draghi, he was here briefing E.U. leaders yesterday. He talked about four risks. And one of them -- and in fact, the top one -- was around protectionisms. And it's clearly very much on the Central Bank's radar. Protectionism is the biggest risk to the European economy.</p><p>He also talks about less reliance on international forums that have been used previously, of course.</p><p>But in -- in terms of the size and scope of this -- this fear or this risk, the fact that Draghi puts that at the top at number one, suggests that it's something that the ECB is watching incredibly closely.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. And I think that's actually potentially encouraging for -- for European stocks. I mean, it means that the interest rates in -- within the eurozone are going to be kept on the floor. I think that the language is -- was fairly dovish at the last conference.</p><p>He cited this risk, he recognizes that the Q.E. program's going to end in September, but he -- he was at pains to say that that doesn't mean that interest rates are going to be the next step.</p><p>So rates will stay low and I think this -- any fear of a trade war is going to keep rates even -- even sort of more permanently low than -- than we -- than market currently anticipates. So that could be good for equities.</p><p>EDWARDS: Could be good (ph) (INAUDIBLE). Interesting story on the Bloomberg, also, around productivity in Europe, Julian. As some of our colleagues writing about how some of the measures that have been taken by European governments are actually driving up productivity that -- labor that was on the sidelines is now coming back into the workforce.</p><p>And so as a result, Europe is actually discovering more slack, which means it can continue growing without creating inflation.</p><p>Now, while some of that might sound like very good news, as, of course, that makes the ECB's job more difficult when it continues to try and generate inflation.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I mean, we -- we talk about the Phillips curve challenge (ph) within the U.S., don't we? But Europe isn't even there yet. So we haven't even tested the Phillips curve in Europe.</p><p>You know, unemployment is -- is just under, I think, 10 percent at this point. So Europe can actually sustain a sort of Goldilocks scenario, whereby growth continues to improve but there's no inflation.</p><p>Yes, that might be frustrating for -- for the ECB, but I think actually it's -- it's probably quite a good state of affairs. And then we can sort of resume the conversation, I guess, when unemployment gets to the sort of six percent, five percent level.</p><p>But I think in the meantime, there's quite a nice sort of Goldilocks-type path for Europe, whereby growth improves but there's no -- no price pressure at the same time.</p><p>CEHIC: But Julian, what about the fact that we've seen some softness in recent eurozone PMIs for two months in a row, now? And not only that, but if I take you to this chart, 8431, the economic surprise index, the Citi (ph) economic surprise index actually undershooting expectations by the most in two years. Are eurozone equities still a buy, despite all this?</p><p>HOWARD: I -- I think there are two things going on. One is that the euro has been quite strong against the dollar. I think we're around 1.23 at the moment for that -- is proving a headwind for what I call \"global Europe,\" so that's sort of globally-facing European exporters, that's - that is a bit of a challenge.</p><p>So I -- I think that -- that can be a bit of a headwind. And also, there - - there's this idea of hedonic adaptation, which is -- whereby, you know, the data's so -- has been so relentlessly good that people have just got used to it.</p><p>So unless the data remains, you know, amazing and continues to surprise, you're going to get this rollover in the indices. It doesn't mean that in absolute terms, that the data is poor.</p><p>You know, The PMIs are still firmly expansionary. But, yes, they've come off a little bit recently. But that's maybe one or two data points, so I don't think we can draw conclusions quite yet.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, one of the points of discussion that was meant to happen at the E.U. leader (ph) summit but has sort of been pushed back somewhat, is this transitional deal. Does that change anything in the way you look at the U.K. as an investment destination?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. So I -- I'm probably -- I've been quite optimistic so far this morning. On Brexit, I think, I'm -- I'm a bit more pessimistic, and particularly around this -- this conference that's happening today.</p><p>I think the Irish still have the ability to pull the plug on the transition deal. So we have this sort of run-up in sterling, sort of increased optimism that we're going to get transition.</p><p>But unless the Irish are happy around the border arrangement, they could still pull the plug. I mean, that would be the nuclear option for them, given that both governments got a stake in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>But -- but it is possible. I mean, there are red lines here around, you know, around a hard border. And we have this backstop idea, but I don't think the U.K.'s going to accept that, and I don't think that the DUP will either.</p><p>So that -- that is still an area of concern. In terms of investments, we try and avoid the U.K., not so much because of Brexit but we think the opportunities are better elsewhere, for example emerging markets.</p><p>EDWARDS: What would make you change your mind, Julian? What would change the dial for you on the Brexit conversation? Are you looking for, actually, the U.K. government to change its stance and decide to stay in the Customs Union? Would that be a game-changer? Or do you just need to see the existing plan delivered against? What -- what's the priority?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I think it would be -- it would be what we call \"BINO,\" Brexit in Name Only. You know, so that's a -- the sort of latest acronym doing the rounds. But I think some kind of Customs Union is (ph) at (ph) a very soft Brexit, where it's just a -- a kind of nominal \"Yes, we'll tick the box that we are outside the European Union, but in every other way we are essentially still in.\"</p><p>I think that's really the only way to sort of preserve growth and access to -- to the markets that -- that, certainly, the financial community is looking for. But I think at the moment, we're headed for something probably a little harder.</p><p>I mean, there have been signs from, certainly, the hard Brexiteers, such as (INAUDIBLE) and Rees-Mogg, for example that, you know, there are signs of pragmatism, that he can't get everything that -- that he wants. Not that he represents the hard Brexit camp on his own, but there are signs that this could be a compromise.</p><p>So we're probably not going to have the hardest Brexit. It's -- at the moment, it looks like we're -- we're set on a middle course. But it's still going to be damaging for -- for growth in -- in the medium term for the U.K.</p><p>EDWARDS: What do asset allocation decisions look like around U.K. assets then, at GAM? When you talk about this, Julian. You said you're pretty negative on the Brexit story. But which of the assets that look -- look better than others, I suppose?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. So I mean, it's not -- we're underweight, the U.K., not so much because of Brexit. Because, of course, there's this inverse relationship with sterling and the FTSE. So we're -- if -- if there was catastrophes, sterling would fall and the FTSE would -- would conversely rise.</p><p>And -- and we can't get a handle on -- on where sterling is going. It's very, very hard to predict how the currency is going to behave. 2018 saw sterling appreciate, and that was kind of quite unexpected. So we -- we try and stay neutral around sterling.</p><p>And then in terms of the equity market, we're underweight. But that's really because we -- we just think there are better opportunities elsewhere, such as emerging markets. Particularly now that we've had these sort of three, four percent sell-offs overnight. You know, across Asia.</p><p>I think that makes emerging markets very, very attractive. They're already trading at around 70 percent of the valuation of global equities, and now they're probably even cheaper.</p><p>So E.M., I think, is where the future lies. And -- and we've come to see almost quasi-permanent overweight allocations to that area. I mean, that - - that is where the growth is now, it's where the growth is in the long term.</p><p>EDWARDS: OK. Tying back nicely -- tying back nicely, Julian, to our top story, whether these market sell-offs, these equity sell-offs are overdone (ph). Thank you very much.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us here on the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, is still with us.</p><p>Again, difficult for the IPOs, I guess. But looking at the tax sector more broadly, then, Julian, it's been, of course, a fascinating week in the Facebook story.</p><p>Broadening that out, would it be -- to put it too strongly, to talk about a real threat to the business models? Almost an existential threat to any business models in tech that rely on the sale of data.</p><p>And I know Facebook doesn't only rely on that, it relies on other things like advertising. But any tech stock that relies only on the sale of data, does it have to worry more about regulatory risk now?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I think there is the possibility of increased regulation. And I think Mark Zuckerberg gave a very sort of guarded invitation to -- for increased regulation, although I think it was more for the advertisers than for his own company.</p><p>But I think more generally, social -- the sort of social media tech is having something of a tobacco moment here, where -- whereby the business model is kind of being revealed to -- to the users.</p><p>I mean, the users, I think, are starting to realize that they are not the client. That, actually, it's the advertisers that are the clients, and in fact the user is paying for this apparently free service, you know, with the currency of their privacy and their data, which is then being, sort of -- they don't have control over it once they've handed it over.</p><p>So I -- I think it actually boosts the case for active management around technology. You know, perhaps starting to look very carefully around social media companies and -- and wondering whether, you know, the business model is sustainable, or at least is correctly priced.</p><p>And perhaps focusing instead on what I call the \"second-line technology sectors,\" such as storage and automation. And, I guess, Dropbox, at a push, falls into the storage category.</p><p>EDWARDS: And perhaps you look at other -- other things, like hardware. Are you interested in tech hardware at this time, or perhaps other geographies? We were looking -- talking about the Tencent earnings earlier on this week. I mean, perhaps there is less of a regulatory threat in other parts of the world.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. And I -- I think also, the fact that we've had this sell-off in Asia actually makes some of the -- some of the Asian, you know, companies, particularly attractive.</p><p>I mean, in -- I mean, without getting stock-specific, in the U.S. you have these sort of FANG (ph) giants who are considered unassailable. But I think it's the case that a lot of the Asian companies have -- have sort of been holding off competing with them because of the anti-Chinese rhetoric that's coming out of Washington.</p><p>So at some point, maybe if you're a long-term -- very, very long-term investor, this is a good time to buy, see through the Trump administration, then these guys start to compete against the FANGs (ph), that could be a very interesting opportunity.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes. Julian -- I mean, and also we don't yet know exactly how GDPR, the advent of that in the E.U. might impact tech stocks globally as well.</p><p>But away from regulation, the trade story. Does that pose any concern around threat -- around tech, particularly in the U.S.?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. Well, there's -- I guess there's the intellectual property issue. And we've also seen that the block -- the blocking of the deal between Qualcomm and Broadcom, although technically I think that's (ph) Singaporean rather than Chinese. So I think that's always something to bear in mind.</p><p>But what interests me is the fact that Asian tech at the moment is looking, you know, it's four percent cheaper today than it was, potentially, yesterday.</p><p>So I think that could be interesting, especially given that, in the U.S., it's really tech that's driven the market up all this way. And now that has been reversed. So it just makes Asia look that bit more attractive versus the U.S.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. To that point, I've got a chart here, 516, in terms of the weight of tech. And this chart also shows -- shows the weight of financials, incidentally, of the S&amp;P 500. Does that make you less positive on U.S. stocks overall? Or is there another narrative that means you're still bullish on them?</p><p>HOWARD: Well it -- it makes me think, actually, that -- that, if anything, you've got to be selective with tech. But actually, financials are the opportunity here. I think we were just commenting that the 10-year yield has not fallen as much as expected. And financials tend to do pretty well if you get a -- a rising 10-year yield and a -- and a sort of falling short-term.</p><p>Now we haven't had that so much yet, but the -- I think the backdrop's in place. Jerome Powell has talked about, you know, inflation not being the threat that everyone thinks it is, which suggests that the short-term should stay low.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth is improving in America. We've seen the ISM Manufacturing. That'll push the 10-year higher. This should be good for financial stocks.</p><p>CEHIC: So it's deepening (ph). Right -- Anna.</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian -- Julian, here in Brussels, the leaders gathered yesterday and one of the things they did do was cast some doubt over the European Commission's plan for a three percent revenue tax on some of these big tech companies.</p><p>That would -- would that be quite an unprecedented move, to see revenues taxed in that way?</p><p>HOWARD: I think it would. And I think it would be very self-interested. I mean, the problem is that Europe simply doesn't have the -- you know, the tech giants that -- that the U.S. does.</p><p>And I think this is part of the reason that European equities have this quasi-permanent discount against world equities. That there is no technology representation. Whereas in the U.S., obviously, it's a very big part of it.</p><p>So I think the Europeans need to be a bit careful about seeming to be anti- competitive, and it -- well, in fact, they didn't even have a tech industry to protect -- in the way that the U.S. does. So I -- I think it's a good move, if they -- if they roll back from that.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM. Thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>And Julian continues the conversation with us at 7:30 am U.K. time, on radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Of course, you  could argue, as some of it is knee-jerk at this point.  I just want to  quickly take you to a chart which is a great map, 7385, showing the  exemptions so far globally, and from the U.S. tariffs.</p><p>Japan, notably absent from there.  We have seen Japanese equities lead the  losses overnight.  How bad will things have to get for this sell-off to be  sustained?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think they would have to get a lot worse, and I don't think they  will get a lot worse.  So I think much of this is actually symbolic, and I  think it's really about Trump appealing to the -- to his base, actually.</p><p>I mean, this was a -- a campaign promise, that he was going to do something  about sort of undercutting, you know, Chinese imports and the way that that  was undercutting U.S. industry.  I think he's made that sort of symbolic  gesture now.</p><p>And it's pretty small-scale, actually.  I mean, this is -- this is not  going to be -- have a big impact on growth.  I think most of the estimates  I've seen are about a 0.1 percent impact on U.S. GDP growth.</p><p>So it's all about symbolism.  It's in line with, if you read \"The Art of  the Deal,\" it's in line with sort of making a big hoo-ha and then bringing  people to the negotiating table.</p><p>So I think the market reaction, probably so far, is already a little bit  sort of over -- overdone.</p><p>CEHIC:  Right.  And we have seen some key technicals.  I can bring up a  chart to show you that later.  But we are only on day one.  What would need  to happen where you actually start to become concerned and think that the  sell-off could be more sustained?</p><p>We heard Tom Mackenzie, there, point to some of the extra measures that  China could take.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I, well, I think it would have to be much more broad- based.  I think it would have to be more -- more than just steel and  aluminum.  It would have to be across the board.  It would have to be much  more punitive.  And then there would have to be immediate escalation.  The  exemptions would have to be rolled back.</p><p>I mean, I suppose technically the exemptions are on a temporary basis. Some  of them are sort of, \"We'll have this until -- this exemption until we have  a conversation.\"  So it could be that when that conversation happens, the  exemption is, in fact, repealed.</p><p>So it -- it could, in theory, get a -- get a whole lot worse.  But I would  agree with the analyst that you quoted, that actually this is quite  moderate so far.  And -- and my sense is that it will remain pretty  moderate, and that this will blow over and the news cycle will move on.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR:  Yes.  I mean, good morning, Julian.   Listening to Trump's press conference yesterday, and actually listening to  what Wilbur Ross had to say.  He finished with some quite brief comments,  saying \"We'll end up negotiating, not fighting about this,\" were his words.</p><p>And then also, another reason to be cheerful if you -- if you like  globalization, I suppose.  He did talk about the -- the U.S. is going to  challenge -- or -- or the government talked about how the U.S. is going to  challenge China licensing practices at the WTO.</p><p>So some signs, at least, that the aim here is to get to negotiating table,  and also that some of the well-trodden routes and paths to resolve these  disputes may still be used.  Some of those four (ph) that we thought were  cast aside by the Trump administration could still be used, such as the  WTO.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yeah.  I mean, I absolutely agree.  I -- I think the aim, here, is  not to damage U.S. GDP growth.  I mean, the -- the administration has  quoted the stock market, GDP growth and unemployment relentlessly since  early 2017, as sort of signs of its success in economic policy.</p><p>And I think deep down, they realize that a concerted trade war, an all-out  trade war, would be absolutely catastrophic.  You know, surely the memory  of the -- of the 1920s and the way that trade tariffs were increased by six  percent, just at the wrong moment, that sent the U.S. into depression -- I  think people are still conscious of that.</p><p>So I can't imagine that even this administration would want to risk those - - those kind of milestones that it's been marking out so -- so clearly over  the last 18 months or so.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And, Julian, we heard Trump also talk about how this is partly  being driven by his desire to reduce the trade deficit with China.  What  would -- I mean, it -- clearly, a recession in the United States and  reducing U.S. consumer spending would -- would do something to go along  that route, but he doesn't want to do that, I'm sure.</p><p>But -- so what would bring down the trade deficit between the United States  and China?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I -- I guess an all-out trade war would, where -- whereby  Chinese exports into the U.S. is -- is seriously constrained.</p><p>But I -- I think, actually, it's your first point that is the most obvious  for bringing down that trade deficit, that actually there's a recession and  the U.S. consumer's propensity to consume is based on imports.  So as  consumers feel wealthier, imports tend to get sucked in.  So it would be  one of those two things, neither of which is particularly desirable.</p><p>So actually, for me, the trade deficit is, in fact, a kind of indicator of  economic health.  And I don't think we should target it as this sort of  boogeyman that needs to be corrected.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, just got to break a headline crossing the Bloomberg.  The  Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 4.3 percent, extending its losses.</p><p>And at this point, if you're a Bloomberg client I just want to draw your  attention to the TLIV blog on the Bloomberg that is tracking all the latest  on this day one of a potential trade war, including all the market  reaction.  And, crucially, some of the key levels you want to watch in  these equity indices over in Asia.</p><p>We've already seen the MSCI Asia Pacific Index drop below the 50- and 100- day moving average, and also we've seen Japanese equities drop below the  200-day moving average.</p><p>But I just want to still show this chart, Julian, which is 5781, and it's  the risk-on, risk-off index.  Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch did a survey  recently, showing that even though investors are really concerned about  things like trade, stagflation, they're still long-risk assets.  Why?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I think risk assets still represent the best risk-adjusted  return versus Treasury bonds.  I mean, the equity risk premium at the  moment in the United States is two points -- about 2.6 to 2.8 percent.</p><p>So you are getting 2.8 percent more from holding stocks than you are from  the risk-free rate in treasuries.  That's attractive.  And history suggests  that a risk premium of about 2.8 percent goes on to give you a return of  around six to eight percent from equities over the following two years.   That's not a bad -- that's not a bad outcome.</p><p>CEHIC:  All right.  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM,  stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, still with  us on set in London.</p><p>Julian, when you look at the latest changes, we've got concern around  protectionism writ large across these markets today.  I guess the last  thing investors needed was another concern, and that might be geopolitics.</p><p>Do these moves increase your concern that the hawk of hawks, as Eurasia  (ph) calls him, will bring more geopolitical risk?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well, I mean, John Bolton wrote this paper, didn't he?  I think it  was a couple of years ago.  \"The Legal Case for Attacking North Korea.\"  So  we kind of see what his -- what his -- his view is.  You've got to --  you've got to set that off against Trump's sort of desire to do a deal.</p><p>And I think the idea of sitting down with Kim Jong is actually going to be  so tempting for the -- for the U.S. president.  You know, to be able to  pull off this sort of grand master stroke.</p><p>So I think even though there are more hawks in the administration now, I  think Trump won't sort of -- resist the temptation to sit down and try and  pull off something, incredible deal around North Korea.</p><p>Now if that fails, we'll -- we'll have to see.  But I think at the moment,  it's not obvious that just having John Bolton in there is -- is going to  mean a -- a kind of cooling of relations with North Korea.</p><p>If anything, things have gone quite well recently, and I think Donald Trump  will want to sit down with -- with Kim Jong and try -- try and pull  something off.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 2.8 percent.   Does it go lower from here on these concerns?</p><p>HOWARD:  There -- there may be some short-term re-rating of growth, but I  think the reason that the Treasury yield hasn't gone lower -- and this was  something that we were talking about earlier -- I think it's because a lot  of growth has (ph) priced into it.</p><p>It's not so much that the break-even is -- is moving, it's not so much an  inflation change although that is, partly, a factor because of what Jerome  Powell said about inflation.  That there is no inflation threat.  But it's  just still a lot of growth priced into that yield.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes, and I'm so glad we showed this chart that you highlighted  there as well, highlighted that point.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC:  Let's now bring in Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at  GAM.</p><p>So, Julian, we've seen the reaction in Asian equities.  We'll find out, in  about an hour and a half, how European equities are going to react to all  this.</p><p>In this potential global trade war, how much does Europe actually have to - - have to lose economically?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think it could be significant, but I'm -- I'm very much  encouraged by that initial exemption that's been granted, although it only  lasts for -- it's a temporary one.  But I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by  that.  So I think -- I think something will be -- something will be sorted  out around that.</p><p>But I think, potentially, it -- you know, worst case, it could be very,  very significant but I just don't think that's going to be the reality.   I'm very encouraged that an exemption has been granted in the first  instance.</p><p>CEHIC:  What sort of impact might we see on the euro in all this?  We've  seen the yen bid, questions over whether it could go to 100.  Does the  dollar weaken and therefore the euro strengthens on the back of this and  weighs on European inflation --</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.</p><p>CEHIC:  -- I mean, what's the dynamic here?</p><p>HOWARD:  Oh, it could -- I mean, it could even be the other way around --</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.</p><p>HOWARD:  -- but actually, if -- if we have a really big trade war and a  massive crisis, economic crisis, you know, the -- the dollar could become a  haven currency.</p><p>But it -- you know, it used to have that status but it sort of kind of lost  out to -- to the Japanese yen.  But that could -- that could resume again.   So potentially, you could get euro weakening from this point.  Which,  ironically, would actually be quite helpful for the eurozone's exporters  and, indeed, the European equity market.</p><p>So there's a lot -- there's a lot of factors swirling around at the moment.   So it's very difficult to make a kind of clear currency call on -- on euro- dollar.  But generally, euro strength has been a bit of a headwind for  European equities.  So potentially an unwind of that could -- could be  helpful, but for the wrong reasons.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian, we heard from Mario Draghi, he was here briefing E.U.  leaders yesterday.  He talked about four risks.  And one of them -- and in  fact, the top one -- was around protectionisms.  And it's clearly very much  on the Central Bank's radar.  Protectionism is the biggest risk to the  European economy.</p><p>He also talks about less reliance on international forums that have been  used previously, of course.</p><p>But in -- in terms of the size and scope of this -- this fear or this risk,  the fact that Draghi puts that at the top at number one, suggests that it's  something that the ECB is watching incredibly closely.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  And I think that's actually potentially encouraging for --  for European stocks.  I mean, it means that the interest rates in -- within  the eurozone are going to be kept on the floor.  I think that the language  is -- was fairly dovish at the last conference.</p><p>He cited this risk, he recognizes that the Q.E. program's going to end in  September, but he -- he was at pains to say that that doesn't mean that  interest rates are going to be the next step.</p><p>So rates will stay low and I think this -- any fear of a trade war is going  to keep rates even -- even sort of more permanently low than -- than we --  than market currently anticipates.  So that could be good for equities.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Could be good (ph) (INAUDIBLE).  Interesting story on the  Bloomberg, also, around productivity in Europe, Julian.  As some of our  colleagues writing about how some of the measures that have been taken by  European governments are actually driving up productivity that -- labor  that was on the sidelines is now coming back into the workforce.</p><p>And so as a result, Europe is actually discovering more slack, which means  it can continue growing without creating inflation.</p><p>Now, while some of that might sound like very good news, as, of course,  that makes the ECB's job more difficult when it continues to try and  generate inflation.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I mean, we -- we talk about the Phillips curve challenge  (ph) within the U.S., don't we?  But Europe isn't even there yet.  So we  haven't even tested the Phillips curve in Europe.</p><p>You know, unemployment is -- is just under, I think, 10 percent at this  point.  So Europe can actually sustain a sort of Goldilocks scenario,  whereby growth continues to improve but there's no inflation.</p><p>Yes, that might be frustrating for -- for the ECB, but I think actually  it's -- it's probably quite a good state of affairs.  And then we can sort  of resume the conversation, I guess, when unemployment gets to the sort of  six percent, five percent level.</p><p>But I think in the meantime, there's quite a nice sort of Goldilocks-type  path for Europe, whereby growth improves but there's no -- no price  pressure at the same time.</p><p>CEHIC:  But Julian, what about the fact that we've seen some softness in  recent eurozone PMIs for two months in a row, now?  And not only that, but  if I take you to this chart, 8431, the economic surprise index, the Citi  (ph) economic surprise index actually undershooting expectations by the  most in two years.  Are eurozone equities still a buy, despite all this?</p><p>HOWARD:  I -- I think there are two things going on.  One is that the euro  has been quite strong against the dollar.  I think we're around 1.23 at the  moment for that -- is proving a headwind for what I call \"global Europe,\"  so that's sort of globally-facing European exporters, that's - that is a  bit of a challenge.</p><p>So I -- I think that -- that can be a bit of a headwind.  And also, there - - there's this idea of hedonic adaptation, which is -- whereby, you know,  the data's so -- has been so relentlessly good that people have just got  used to it.</p><p>So unless the data remains, you know, amazing and continues to surprise,  you're going to get this rollover in the indices.  It doesn't mean that in  absolute terms, that the data is poor.</p><p>You know, The PMIs are still firmly expansionary.  But, yes, they've come  off a little bit recently.  But that's maybe one or two data points, so I  don't think we can draw conclusions quite yet.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian, one of the points of discussion that was meant to happen at  the E.U. leader (ph) summit but has sort of been pushed back somewhat, is  this transitional deal.  Does that change anything in the way you look at  the U.K. as an investment destination?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  So I -- I'm probably -- I've been quite optimistic so far  this morning.  On Brexit, I think, I'm -- I'm a bit more pessimistic, and  particularly around this -- this conference that's happening today.</p><p>I think the Irish still have the ability to pull the plug on the transition  deal.  So we have this sort of run-up in sterling, sort of increased  optimism that we're going to get transition.</p><p>But unless the Irish are happy around the border arrangement, they could  still pull the plug.  I mean, that would be the nuclear option for them,  given that both governments got a stake in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>But -- but it is possible.  I mean, there are red lines here around, you  know, around a hard border.  And we have this backstop idea, but I don't  think the U.K.'s going to accept that, and I don't think that the DUP will  either.</p><p>So that -- that is still an area of concern.  In terms of investments, we  try and avoid the U.K., not so much because of Brexit but we think the  opportunities are better elsewhere, for example emerging markets.</p><p>EDWARDS:  What would make you change your mind, Julian?  What would change  the dial for you on the Brexit conversation?  Are you looking for,  actually, the U.K. government to change its stance and decide to stay in  the Customs Union?  Would that be a game-changer?  Or do you just need to  see the existing plan delivered against?  What -- what's the priority?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I think it would be -- it would be what we call \"BINO,\"  Brexit in Name Only.  You know, so that's a -- the sort of latest acronym  doing the rounds.  But I think some kind of Customs Union is (ph) at (ph) a  very soft Brexit, where it's just a -- a kind of nominal \"Yes, we'll tick  the box that we are outside the European Union, but in every other way we  are essentially still in.\"</p><p>I think that's really the only way to sort of preserve growth and access to  -- to the markets that -- that, certainly, the financial community is  looking for.  But I think at the moment, we're headed for something  probably a little harder.</p><p>I mean, there have been signs from, certainly, the hard Brexiteers, such as  (INAUDIBLE) and Rees-Mogg, for example that, you know, there are signs of  pragmatism, that he can't get everything that -- that he wants.  Not that  he represents the hard Brexit camp on his own, but there are signs that  this could be a compromise.</p><p>So we're probably not going to have the hardest Brexit.  It's -- at the  moment, it looks like we're -- we're set on a middle course.  But it's  still going to be damaging for -- for growth in -- in the medium term for  the U.K.</p><p>EDWARDS:  What do asset allocation decisions look like around U.K. assets  then, at GAM?  When you talk about this, Julian. You said you're pretty  negative on the Brexit story.  But which of the assets that look -- look  better than others, I suppose?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  So I mean, it's not -- we're underweight, the U.K., not so  much because of Brexit.  Because, of course, there's this inverse  relationship with sterling and the FTSE.  So we're -- if -- if there was  catastrophes, sterling would fall and the FTSE would -- would conversely  rise.</p><p>And -- and we can't get a handle on -- on where sterling is going.  It's  very, very hard to predict how the currency is going to behave.  2018 saw  sterling appreciate, and that was kind of quite unexpected.  So we -- we  try and stay neutral around sterling.</p><p>And then in terms of the equity market, we're underweight.  But that's  really because we -- we just think there are better opportunities  elsewhere, such as emerging markets.  Particularly now that we've had these  sort of three, four percent sell-offs overnight.  You know, across Asia.</p><p>I think that makes emerging markets very, very attractive.  They're already  trading at around 70 percent of the valuation of global equities, and now  they're probably even cheaper.</p><p>So E.M., I think, is where the future lies.  And -- and we've come to see  almost quasi-permanent overweight allocations to that area.  I mean, that - - that is where the growth is now, it's where the growth is in the long  term.</p><p>EDWARDS:  OK.  Tying back nicely -- tying back nicely, Julian, to our top  story, whether these market sell-offs, these equity sell-offs are overdone  (ph).  Thank you very much.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us here on  the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, is still  with us.</p><p>Again, difficult for the IPOs, I guess.  But looking at the tax sector more  broadly, then, Julian, it's been, of course, a fascinating week in the  Facebook story.</p><p>Broadening that out, would it be -- to put it too strongly, to talk about a  real threat to the business models?  Almost an existential threat to any  business models in tech that rely on the sale of data.</p><p>And I know Facebook doesn't only rely on that, it relies on other things  like advertising.  But any tech stock that relies only on the sale of data,  does it have to worry more about regulatory risk now?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  I -- I think there is the possibility of increased  regulation.  And I think Mark Zuckerberg gave a very sort of guarded  invitation to -- for increased regulation, although I think it was more for  the advertisers than for his own company.</p><p>But I think more generally, social -- the sort of social media tech is  having something of a tobacco moment here, where -- whereby the business  model is kind of being revealed to -- to the users.</p><p>I mean, the users, I think, are starting to realize that they are not the  client.  That, actually, it's the advertisers that are the clients, and in  fact the user is paying for this apparently free service, you know, with  the currency of their privacy and their data, which is then being, sort of  -- they don't have control over it once they've handed it over.</p><p>So I -- I think it actually boosts the case for active management around  technology.  You know, perhaps starting to look very carefully around  social media companies and -- and wondering whether, you know, the business  model is sustainable, or at least is correctly priced.</p><p>And perhaps focusing instead on what I call the \"second-line technology  sectors,\" such as storage and automation.  And, I guess, Dropbox, at a  push, falls into the storage category.</p><p>EDWARDS:  And perhaps you look at other -- other things, like hardware.   Are you interested in tech hardware at this time, or perhaps other  geographies?  We were looking -- talking about the Tencent earnings earlier  on this week.  I mean, perhaps there is less of a regulatory threat in  other parts of the world.</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  And I -- I think also, the fact that we've had this sell-off  in Asia actually makes some of the -- some of the Asian, you know,  companies, particularly attractive.</p><p>I mean, in -- I mean, without getting stock-specific, in the U.S. you have  these sort of FANG (ph) giants who are considered unassailable.  But I  think it's the case that a lot of the Asian companies have -- have sort of  been holding off competing with them because of the anti-Chinese rhetoric  that's coming out of Washington.</p><p>So at some point, maybe if you're a long-term -- very, very long-term  investor, this is a good time to buy, see through the Trump administration,  then these guys start to compete against the FANGs (ph), that could be a  very interesting opportunity.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Yes.  Julian -- I mean, and also we don't yet know exactly how  GDPR, the advent of that in the E.U. might impact tech stocks globally as  well.</p><p>But away from regulation, the trade story.  Does that pose any concern  around threat -- around tech, particularly in the U.S.?</p><p>HOWARD:  Yes.  Well, there's -- I guess there's the intellectual property  issue.  And we've also seen that the block -- the blocking of the deal  between Qualcomm and Broadcom, although technically I think that's (ph)  Singaporean rather than Chinese.  So I think that's always something to  bear in mind.</p><p>But what interests me is the fact that Asian tech at the moment is looking,  you know, it's four percent cheaper today than it was, potentially,  yesterday.</p><p>So I think that could be interesting, especially given that, in the U.S.,  it's really tech that's driven the market up all this way.  And now that  has been reversed.  So it just makes Asia look that bit more attractive  versus the U.S.</p><p>CEHIC:  Yes.  To that point, I've got a chart here, 516, in terms of the  weight of tech.  And this chart also shows -- shows the weight of  financials, incidentally, of the S&amp;P 500.  Does that make you less positive  on U.S. stocks overall?  Or is there another narrative that means you're  still bullish on them?</p><p>HOWARD:  Well it -- it makes me think, actually, that -- that, if anything,  you've got to be selective with tech.  But actually, financials are the  opportunity here.  I think we were just commenting that the 10-year yield  has not fallen as much as expected.  And financials tend to do pretty well  if you get a -- a rising 10-year yield and a -- and a sort of falling  short-term.</p><p>Now we haven't had that so much yet, but the -- I think the backdrop's in  place.  Jerome Powell has talked about, you know, inflation not being the  threat that everyone thinks it is, which suggests that the short-term  should stay low.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth is improving in America.  We've seen the ISM  Manufacturing.  That'll push the 10-year higher.  This should be good for  financial stocks.</p><p>CEHIC:  So it's deepening (ph).  Right -- Anna.</p><p>EDWARDS:  Julian -- Julian, here in Brussels, the leaders gathered  yesterday and one of the things they did do was cast some doubt over the  European Commission's plan for a three percent revenue tax on some of these  big tech companies.</p><p>That would -- would that be quite an unprecedented move, to see revenues  taxed in that way?</p><p>HOWARD:  I think it would.  And I think it would be very self-interested.   I mean, the problem is that Europe simply doesn't have the -- you know, the  tech giants that -- that the U.S. does.</p><p>And I think this is part of the reason that European equities have this  quasi-permanent discount against world equities.  That there is no  technology representation.  Whereas in the U.S., obviously, it's a very big  part of it.</p><p>So I think the Europeans need to be a bit careful about seeming to be anti- competitive, and it -- well, in fact, they didn't even have a tech industry  to protect -- in the way that the U.S. does.  So I -- I think it's a good  move, if they -- if they roll back from that.</p><p>CEHIC:  Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.  Thank you so  much for being with us.</p><p>And Julian continues the conversation with us at 7:30 am U.K. time, on  radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Of course, you could argue, as some of it is knee-jerk at this point. I just want to quickly take you to a chart which is a great map, 7385, showing the exemptions so far globally, and from the U.S. tariffs.</p><p>Japan, notably absent from there. We have seen Japanese equities lead the losses overnight. How bad will things have to get for this sell-off to be sustained?</p><p>HOWARD: I think they would have to get a lot worse, and I don't think they will get a lot worse. So I think much of this is actually symbolic, and I think it's really about Trump appealing to the -- to his base, actually.</p><p>I mean, this was a -- a campaign promise, that he was going to do something about sort of undercutting, you know, Chinese imports and the way that that was undercutting U.S. industry. I think he's made that sort of symbolic gesture now.</p><p>And it's pretty small-scale, actually. I mean, this is -- this is not going to be -- have a big impact on growth. I think most of the estimates I've seen are about a 0.1 percent impact on U.S. GDP growth.</p><p>So it's all about symbolism. It's in line with, if you read \"The Art of the Deal,\" it's in line with sort of making a big hoo-ha and then bringing people to the negotiating table.</p><p>So I think the market reaction, probably so far, is already a little bit sort of over -- overdone.</p><p>CEHIC: Right. And we have seen some key technicals. I can bring up a chart to show you that later. But we are only on day one. What would need to happen where you actually start to become concerned and think that the sell-off could be more sustained?</p><p>We heard Tom Mackenzie, there, point to some of the extra measures that China could take.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I, well, I think it would have to be much more broad- based. I think it would have to be more -- more than just steel and aluminum. It would have to be across the board. It would have to be much more punitive. And then there would have to be immediate escalation. The exemptions would have to be rolled back.</p><p>I mean, I suppose technically the exemptions are on a temporary basis. Some of them are sort of, \"We'll have this until -- this exemption until we have a conversation.\" So it could be that when that conversation happens, the exemption is, in fact, repealed.</p><p>So it -- it could, in theory, get a -- get a whole lot worse. But I would agree with the analyst that you quoted, that actually this is quite moderate so far. And -- and my sense is that it will remain pretty moderate, and that this will blow over and the news cycle will move on.</p><p>ANNA EDWARDS, BLOOMBERG ANCHOR: Yes. I mean, good morning, Julian. Listening to Trump's press conference yesterday, and actually listening to what Wilbur Ross had to say. He finished with some quite brief comments, saying \"We'll end up negotiating, not fighting about this,\" were his words.</p><p>And then also, another reason to be cheerful if you -- if you like globalization, I suppose. He did talk about the -- the U.S. is going to challenge -- or -- or the government talked about how the U.S. is going to challenge China licensing practices at the WTO.</p><p>So some signs, at least, that the aim here is to get to negotiating table, and also that some of the well-trodden routes and paths to resolve these disputes may still be used. Some of those four (ph) that we thought were cast aside by the Trump administration could still be used, such as the WTO.</p><p>HOWARD: Yeah. I mean, I absolutely agree. I -- I think the aim, here, is not to damage U.S. GDP growth. I mean, the -- the administration has quoted the stock market, GDP growth and unemployment relentlessly since early 2017, as sort of signs of its success in economic policy.</p><p>And I think deep down, they realize that a concerted trade war, an all-out trade war, would be absolutely catastrophic. You know, surely the memory of the -- of the 1920s and the way that trade tariffs were increased by six percent, just at the wrong moment, that sent the U.S. into depression -- I think people are still conscious of that.</p><p>So I can't imagine that even this administration would want to risk those - - those kind of milestones that it's been marking out so -- so clearly over the last 18 months or so.</p><p>EDWARDS: And, Julian, we heard Trump also talk about how this is partly being driven by his desire to reduce the trade deficit with China. What would -- I mean, it -- clearly, a recession in the United States and reducing U.S. consumer spending would -- would do something to go along that route, but he doesn't want to do that, I'm sure.</p><p>But -- so what would bring down the trade deficit between the United States and China?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I -- I guess an all-out trade war would, where -- whereby Chinese exports into the U.S. is -- is seriously constrained.</p><p>But I -- I think, actually, it's your first point that is the most obvious for bringing down that trade deficit, that actually there's a recession and the U.S. consumer's propensity to consume is based on imports. So as consumers feel wealthier, imports tend to get sucked in. So it would be one of those two things, neither of which is particularly desirable.</p><p>So actually, for me, the trade deficit is, in fact, a kind of indicator of economic health. And I don't think we should target it as this sort of boogeyman that needs to be corrected.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, just got to break a headline crossing the Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 4.3 percent, extending its losses.</p><p>And at this point, if you're a Bloomberg client I just want to draw your attention to the TLIV blog on the Bloomberg that is tracking all the latest on this day one of a potential trade war, including all the market reaction. And, crucially, some of the key levels you want to watch in these equity indices over in Asia.</p><p>We've already seen the MSCI Asia Pacific Index drop below the 50- and 100- day moving average, and also we've seen Japanese equities drop below the 200-day moving average.</p><p>But I just want to still show this chart, Julian, which is 5781, and it's the risk-on, risk-off index. Bank of America Merrill Lynch did a survey recently, showing that even though investors are really concerned about things like trade, stagflation, they're still long-risk assets. Why?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I think risk assets still represent the best risk-adjusted return versus Treasury bonds. I mean, the equity risk premium at the moment in the United States is two points -- about 2.6 to 2.8 percent.</p><p>So you are getting 2.8 percent more from holding stocks than you are from the risk-free rate in treasuries. That's attractive. And history suggests that a risk premium of about 2.8 percent goes on to give you a return of around six to eight percent from equities over the following two years. That's not a bad -- that's not a bad outcome.</p><p>CEHIC: All right. Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, still with us on set in London.</p><p>Julian, when you look at the latest changes, we've got concern around protectionism writ large across these markets today. I guess the last thing investors needed was another concern, and that might be geopolitics.</p><p>Do these moves increase your concern that the hawk of hawks, as Eurasia (ph) calls him, will bring more geopolitical risk?</p><p>HOWARD: Well, I mean, John Bolton wrote this paper, didn't he? I think it was a couple of years ago. \"The Legal Case for Attacking North Korea.\" So we kind of see what his -- what his -- his view is. You've got to -- you've got to set that off against Trump's sort of desire to do a deal.</p><p>And I think the idea of sitting down with Kim Jong is actually going to be so tempting for the -- for the U.S. president. You know, to be able to pull off this sort of grand master stroke.</p><p>So I think even though there are more hawks in the administration now, I think Trump won't sort of -- resist the temptation to sit down and try and pull off something, incredible deal around North Korea.</p><p>Now if that fails, we'll -- we'll have to see. But I think at the moment, it's not obvious that just having John Bolton in there is -- is going to mean a -- a kind of cooling of relations with North Korea.</p><p>If anything, things have gone quite well recently, and I think Donald Trump will want to sit down with -- with Kim Jong and try -- try and pull something off.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, the 10-year Treasury yield hovering around 2.8 percent. Does it go lower from here on these concerns?</p><p>HOWARD: There -- there may be some short-term re-rating of growth, but I think the reason that the Treasury yield hasn't gone lower -- and this was something that we were talking about earlier -- I think it's because a lot of growth has (ph) priced into it.</p><p>It's not so much that the break-even is -- is moving, it's not so much an inflation change although that is, partly, a factor because of what Jerome Powell said about inflation. That there is no inflation threat. But it's just still a lot of growth priced into that yield.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes, and I'm so glad we showed this chart that you highlighted there as well, highlighted that point.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>CEHIC: Let's now bring in Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM.</p><p>So, Julian, we've seen the reaction in Asian equities. We'll find out, in about an hour and a half, how European equities are going to react to all this.</p><p>In this potential global trade war, how much does Europe actually have to - - have to lose economically?</p><p>HOWARD: I think it could be significant, but I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that initial exemption that's been granted, although it only lasts for -- it's a temporary one. But I'm -- I'm very much encouraged by that. So I think -- I think something will be -- something will be sorted out around that.</p><p>But I think, potentially, it -- you know, worst case, it could be very, very significant but I just don't think that's going to be the reality. I'm very encouraged that an exemption has been granted in the first instance.</p><p>CEHIC: What sort of impact might we see on the euro in all this? We've seen the yen bid, questions over whether it could go to 100. Does the dollar weaken and therefore the euro strengthens on the back of this and weighs on European inflation --</p><p>HOWARD: Yes.</p><p>CEHIC: -- I mean, what's the dynamic here?</p><p>HOWARD: Oh, it could -- I mean, it could even be the other way around --</p><p>CEHIC: Yes.</p><p>HOWARD: -- but actually, if -- if we have a really big trade war and a massive crisis, economic crisis, you know, the -- the dollar could become a haven currency.</p><p>But it -- you know, it used to have that status but it sort of kind of lost out to -- to the Japanese yen. But that could -- that could resume again. So potentially, you could get euro weakening from this point. Which, ironically, would actually be quite helpful for the eurozone's exporters and, indeed, the European equity market.</p><p>So there's a lot -- there's a lot of factors swirling around at the moment. So it's very difficult to make a kind of clear currency call on -- on euro- dollar. But generally, euro strength has been a bit of a headwind for European equities. So potentially an unwind of that could -- could be helpful, but for the wrong reasons.</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian, we heard from Mario Draghi, he was here briefing E.U. leaders yesterday. He talked about four risks. And one of them -- and in fact, the top one -- was around protectionisms. And it's clearly very much on the Central Bank's radar. Protectionism is the biggest risk to the European economy.</p><p>He also talks about less reliance on international forums that have been used previously, of course.</p><p>But in -- in terms of the size and scope of this -- this fear or this risk, the fact that Draghi puts that at the top at number one, suggests that it's something that the ECB is watching incredibly closely.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. And I think that's actually potentially encouraging for -- for European stocks. I mean, it means that the interest rates in -- within the eurozone are going to be kept on the floor. I think that the language is -- was fairly dovish at the last conference.</p><p>He cited this risk, he recognizes that the Q.E. program's going to end in September, but he -- he was at pains to say that that doesn't mean that interest rates are going to be the next step.</p><p>So rates will stay low and I think this -- any fear of a trade war is going to keep rates even -- even sort of more permanently low than -- than we -- than market currently anticipates. So that could be good for equities.</p><p>EDWARDS: Could be good (ph) (INAUDIBLE). Interesting story on the Bloomberg, also, around productivity in Europe, Julian. As some of our colleagues writing about how some of the measures that have been taken by European governments are actually driving up productivity that -- labor that was on the sidelines is now coming back into the workforce.</p><p>And so as a result, Europe is actually discovering more slack, which means it can continue growing without creating inflation.</p><p>Now, while some of that might sound like very good news, as, of course, that makes the ECB's job more difficult when it continues to try and generate inflation.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I mean, we -- we talk about the Phillips curve challenge (ph) within the U.S., don't we? But Europe isn't even there yet. So we haven't even tested the Phillips curve in Europe.</p><p>You know, unemployment is -- is just under, I think, 10 percent at this point. So Europe can actually sustain a sort of Goldilocks scenario, whereby growth continues to improve but there's no inflation.</p><p>Yes, that might be frustrating for -- for the ECB, but I think actually it's -- it's probably quite a good state of affairs. And then we can sort of resume the conversation, I guess, when unemployment gets to the sort of six percent, five percent level.</p><p>But I think in the meantime, there's quite a nice sort of Goldilocks-type path for Europe, whereby growth improves but there's no -- no price pressure at the same time.</p><p>CEHIC: But Julian, what about the fact that we've seen some softness in recent eurozone PMIs for two months in a row, now? And not only that, but if I take you to this chart, 8431, the economic surprise index, the Citi (ph) economic surprise index actually undershooting expectations by the most in two years. Are eurozone equities still a buy, despite all this?</p><p>HOWARD: I -- I think there are two things going on. One is that the euro has been quite strong against the dollar. I think we're around 1.23 at the moment for that -- is proving a headwind for what I call \"global Europe,\" so that's sort of globally-facing European exporters, that's - that is a bit of a challenge.</p><p>So I -- I think that -- that can be a bit of a headwind. And also, there - - there's this idea of hedonic adaptation, which is -- whereby, you know, the data's so -- has been so relentlessly good that people have just got used to it.</p><p>So unless the data remains, you know, amazing and continues to surprise, you're going to get this rollover in the indices. It doesn't mean that in absolute terms, that the data is poor.</p><p>You know, The PMIs are still firmly expansionary. But, yes, they've come off a little bit recently. But that's maybe one or two data points, so I don't think we can draw conclusions quite yet.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian, one of the points of discussion that was meant to happen at the E.U. leader (ph) summit but has sort of been pushed back somewhat, is this transitional deal. Does that change anything in the way you look at the U.K. as an investment destination?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. So I -- I'm probably -- I've been quite optimistic so far this morning. On Brexit, I think, I'm -- I'm a bit more pessimistic, and particularly around this -- this conference that's happening today.</p><p>I think the Irish still have the ability to pull the plug on the transition deal. So we have this sort of run-up in sterling, sort of increased optimism that we're going to get transition.</p><p>But unless the Irish are happy around the border arrangement, they could still pull the plug. I mean, that would be the nuclear option for them, given that both governments got a stake in the Good Friday Agreement.</p><p>But -- but it is possible. I mean, there are red lines here around, you know, around a hard border. And we have this backstop idea, but I don't think the U.K.'s going to accept that, and I don't think that the DUP will either.</p><p>So that -- that is still an area of concern. In terms of investments, we try and avoid the U.K., not so much because of Brexit but we think the opportunities are better elsewhere, for example emerging markets.</p><p>EDWARDS: What would make you change your mind, Julian? What would change the dial for you on the Brexit conversation? Are you looking for, actually, the U.K. government to change its stance and decide to stay in the Customs Union? Would that be a game-changer? Or do you just need to see the existing plan delivered against? What -- what's the priority?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I think it would be -- it would be what we call \"BINO,\" Brexit in Name Only. You know, so that's a -- the sort of latest acronym doing the rounds. But I think some kind of Customs Union is (ph) at (ph) a very soft Brexit, where it's just a -- a kind of nominal \"Yes, we'll tick the box that we are outside the European Union, but in every other way we are essentially still in.\"</p><p>I think that's really the only way to sort of preserve growth and access to -- to the markets that -- that, certainly, the financial community is looking for. But I think at the moment, we're headed for something probably a little harder.</p><p>I mean, there have been signs from, certainly, the hard Brexiteers, such as (INAUDIBLE) and Rees-Mogg, for example that, you know, there are signs of pragmatism, that he can't get everything that -- that he wants. Not that he represents the hard Brexit camp on his own, but there are signs that this could be a compromise.</p><p>So we're probably not going to have the hardest Brexit. It's -- at the moment, it looks like we're -- we're set on a middle course. But it's still going to be damaging for -- for growth in -- in the medium term for the U.K.</p><p>EDWARDS: What do asset allocation decisions look like around U.K. assets then, at GAM? When you talk about this, Julian. You said you're pretty negative on the Brexit story. But which of the assets that look -- look better than others, I suppose?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. So I mean, it's not -- we're underweight, the U.K., not so much because of Brexit. Because, of course, there's this inverse relationship with sterling and the FTSE. So we're -- if -- if there was catastrophes, sterling would fall and the FTSE would -- would conversely rise.</p><p>And -- and we can't get a handle on -- on where sterling is going. It's very, very hard to predict how the currency is going to behave. 2018 saw sterling appreciate, and that was kind of quite unexpected. So we -- we try and stay neutral around sterling.</p><p>And then in terms of the equity market, we're underweight. But that's really because we -- we just think there are better opportunities elsewhere, such as emerging markets. Particularly now that we've had these sort of three, four percent sell-offs overnight. You know, across Asia.</p><p>I think that makes emerging markets very, very attractive. They're already trading at around 70 percent of the valuation of global equities, and now they're probably even cheaper.</p><p>So E.M., I think, is where the future lies. And -- and we've come to see almost quasi-permanent overweight allocations to that area. I mean, that - - that is where the growth is now, it's where the growth is in the long term.</p><p>EDWARDS: OK. Tying back nicely -- tying back nicely, Julian, to our top story, whether these market sell-offs, these equity sell-offs are overdone (ph). Thank you very much.</p><p>Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, stays with us here on the program.</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM, is still with us.</p><p>Again, difficult for the IPOs, I guess. But looking at the tax sector more broadly, then, Julian, it's been, of course, a fascinating week in the Facebook story.</p><p>Broadening that out, would it be -- to put it too strongly, to talk about a real threat to the business models? Almost an existential threat to any business models in tech that rely on the sale of data.</p><p>And I know Facebook doesn't only rely on that, it relies on other things like advertising. But any tech stock that relies only on the sale of data, does it have to worry more about regulatory risk now?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. I -- I think there is the possibility of increased regulation. And I think Mark Zuckerberg gave a very sort of guarded invitation to -- for increased regulation, although I think it was more for the advertisers than for his own company.</p><p>But I think more generally, social -- the sort of social media tech is having something of a tobacco moment here, where -- whereby the business model is kind of being revealed to -- to the users.</p><p>I mean, the users, I think, are starting to realize that they are not the client. That, actually, it's the advertisers that are the clients, and in fact the user is paying for this apparently free service, you know, with the currency of their privacy and their data, which is then being, sort of -- they don't have control over it once they've handed it over.</p><p>So I -- I think it actually boosts the case for active management around technology. You know, perhaps starting to look very carefully around social media companies and -- and wondering whether, you know, the business model is sustainable, or at least is correctly priced.</p><p>And perhaps focusing instead on what I call the \"second-line technology sectors,\" such as storage and automation. And, I guess, Dropbox, at a push, falls into the storage category.</p><p>EDWARDS: And perhaps you look at other -- other things, like hardware. Are you interested in tech hardware at this time, or perhaps other geographies? We were looking -- talking about the Tencent earnings earlier on this week. I mean, perhaps there is less of a regulatory threat in other parts of the world.</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. And I -- I think also, the fact that we've had this sell-off in Asia actually makes some of the -- some of the Asian, you know, companies, particularly attractive.</p><p>I mean, in -- I mean, without getting stock-specific, in the U.S. you have these sort of FANG (ph) giants who are considered unassailable. But I think it's the case that a lot of the Asian companies have -- have sort of been holding off competing with them because of the anti-Chinese rhetoric that's coming out of Washington.</p><p>So at some point, maybe if you're a long-term -- very, very long-term investor, this is a good time to buy, see through the Trump administration, then these guys start to compete against the FANGs (ph), that could be a very interesting opportunity.</p><p>EDWARDS: Yes. Julian -- I mean, and also we don't yet know exactly how GDPR, the advent of that in the E.U. might impact tech stocks globally as well.</p><p>But away from regulation, the trade story. Does that pose any concern around threat -- around tech, particularly in the U.S.?</p><p>HOWARD: Yes. Well, there's -- I guess there's the intellectual property issue. And we've also seen that the block -- the blocking of the deal between Qualcomm and Broadcom, although technically I think that's (ph) Singaporean rather than Chinese. So I think that's always something to bear in mind.</p><p>But what interests me is the fact that Asian tech at the moment is looking, you know, it's four percent cheaper today than it was, potentially, yesterday.</p><p>So I think that could be interesting, especially given that, in the U.S., it's really tech that's driven the market up all this way. And now that has been reversed. So it just makes Asia look that bit more attractive versus the U.S.</p><p>CEHIC: Yes. To that point, I've got a chart here, 516, in terms of the weight of tech. And this chart also shows -- shows the weight of financials, incidentally, of the S&amp;P 500. Does that make you less positive on U.S. stocks overall? Or is there another narrative that means you're still bullish on them?</p><p>HOWARD: Well it -- it makes me think, actually, that -- that, if anything, you've got to be selective with tech. But actually, financials are the opportunity here. I think we were just commenting that the 10-year yield has not fallen as much as expected. And financials tend to do pretty well if you get a -- a rising 10-year yield and a -- and a sort of falling short-term.</p><p>Now we haven't had that so much yet, but the -- I think the backdrop's in place. Jerome Powell has talked about, you know, inflation not being the threat that everyone thinks it is, which suggests that the short-term should stay low.</p><p>Meanwhile, growth is improving in America. We've seen the ISM Manufacturing. That'll push the 10-year higher. This should be good for financial stocks.</p><p>CEHIC: So it's deepening (ph). Right -- Anna.</p><p>EDWARDS: Julian -- Julian, here in Brussels, the leaders gathered yesterday and one of the things they did do was cast some doubt over the European Commission's plan for a three percent revenue tax on some of these big tech companies.</p><p>That would -- would that be quite an unprecedented move, to see revenues taxed in that way?</p><p>HOWARD: I think it would. And I think it would be very self-interested. I mean, the problem is that Europe simply doesn't have the -- you know, the tech giants that -- that the U.S. does.</p><p>And I think this is part of the reason that European equities have this quasi-permanent discount against world equities. That there is no technology representation. Whereas in the U.S., obviously, it's a very big part of it.</p><p>So I think the Europeans need to be a bit careful about seeming to be anti- competitive, and it -- well, in fact, they didn't even have a tech industry to protect -- in the way that the U.S. does. So I -- I think it's a good move, if they -- if they roll back from that.</p><p>CEHIC: Julian Howard, head of Multi-Asset Solutions at GAM. Thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>And Julian continues the conversation with us at 7:30 am U.K. time, on radio.</p><p>***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

MPs from all the major parties have spent the past two years investigating how Facebook and other tech companies can undermine our democracy and expose vulnerable individuals to harm \u2013 and now we\u2019ve set out tough proposals to start putting it right.  First, we want to make the social media giants sign up to a new code of ethics, backed up by a powerful independent regulator. </p><p>This would oblige them to take down illegal or harmful content as quickly as possible \u2013 and punish them if they don\u2019t.  We also want to introduce a new levy on the big tech companies and use it to beef up the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office, who we have called on to launch an in-depth investigation into how Facebook uses (or misuses) its customers\u2019 data.  Further reforms are needed to help protect our democratic process. Our report calls for rigorous new transparency rules for online campaigning, and an increase in the powers of the Electoral Commission to collect evidence and issue fines for inappropriate behaviour.  As a member of the Committee I have seen first-hand the harm that unregulated social media companies can do \u2013 and the huge level of global interest in our pioneering bid to bring them under control. When last year I called Facebook a \u201cmorality-free zone\u201d whilst questioning its Chief Technical Officer, Mike Shroepfer, my comments were picked up by media outlets from all over the world.  In more local news, I am very pleased to report that over seven hundred local residents have so far signed my petition urging the Post Office to reconsider their plans to close and relocate their local branch in Mell Square.  I know from those of you that have got in touch with me about this that the proposals are the cause of a deal of worry here in Solihull, and at the end of the month I intend to present my petition to the House of Commons to highlight the strength of local feeling about this important local service. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURUNN-RLPMN837342020190220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURUNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W6K-9SR1-DXCW-D03F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"364\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>European Union News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"660\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Not unusual for someone who lives and breathes technology. But the executive director of Tech:NYC, an organisation that represents New York\u2019s tech economy and works with city and state government on tech policies, is more forward-looking than most. So much so, she is not afraid to call the end of a phase of the current technology cycle that many might still consider a sign of things to come.\u201cThe last round of huge tech\u00a0companies were created in the Valley and other more isolated geographies,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cBasically, places where people weren\u2019t paying much attention and a company could be built and grown without anyone noticing. Those glory days are gone. The last generation of really big tech companies were built in vacuum. Regulators weren\u2019t paying attention. Competitors weren\u2019t paying attention.\u201cI believe in these big companies, like Facebook and Google, but they would have a really hard time launching in New York. Especially now, with regulation hotting up. And I don\u2019t think we will see the likes of them launch again now. It\u2019s just not the world we live in any more. You can\u2019t build a tech company now without people noticing very quickly and you need to know how to navigate thorny situations like handling competitors and regulators. We are good at that here in New York.\u201dCompatible with techIt is this, she says, that makes strong, business-oriented cities like London and New York more compatible with tech start-ups than ever before.\u201cIn New York and cities like New York everyone is much more integrated with each other and you know the policy makers, your competition and your potential customers and clients.\u201cRegulation will make starting up and growing businesses even more complicated, so you need to be somewhere people already know how to have these tough conversations.\u201dWhat Samuels is effectively describing is the maturity of the tech sector. A process that will happen in stages most likely led by fintech with the likes of real estate technology, which is moving at a glacial pace in comparison, following behind.But she is confident that some of the proptech leaders are now at a stage that indicates the sector is in a strong enough position to weather a stricter, more regulated market.\u201cWe are seeing some big exits,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd there will be more. So some of these larger proptech companies \u2013 such as Compass and even Zillow \u2013 are starting to make a lot of people a lot of money. And they will put their money back into investing in a new crop of proptech companies and start-ups and it becomes a rinse-and-repeat cycle.\u201cThe idea is that when you have these big exits you create an ecosystem. You see the emergence of people who are smart about a certain thing with the money to put their capital \u2013 and I mean intellectual capital, too into the next generation. And then it starts to feed off itself. The tides are turning and changing.\u201cSome of that is just customer and consumer demand. But proptech is getting accepted by the people who control real estate.\u201cLook at the actual money. It\u2019s\u00a0widespread. People have a\u00a0fear of missing out and you have really big companies out there now such as Cadre and Convene. These are not start-ups any more and the property sector can see it. It tips and then it goes. I think we are there at that tipping point now.\u201dPart and parcel of this maturity is the increasingly prominent role of governments and policy makers in technology. While Samuels warns against over E'regulation, she says the government and public sector approach to (and involvement in) technology has never been more important.Industrial revolution\u201cThe path to building a successful technology business or integrating technology into a real estate business is hard and it\u2019s complicated,\u201d she says.\u201cThis emergence of technology worldwide will be like another industrial revolution in terms of its impact and job creation. There will be big winners but there is also going to be a lot of disruption. And government has a huge role to play in minimising that disruption, in making that transition better for its citizens.\u201dTo send feedback, e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:emily.wright@egi.co.uk\">emily.wright@egi.co.uk</email> or tweet @EmilyW_9 or @estatesgazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RBIEGI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RBIEGI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFV-NS41-JCF2-H4F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><timeReceived>07:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Reed Business Information Ltd.

The ambition of EPI is to create a unified pan-European payment solution leveraging instant payments - particularly the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCT Inst) - offering a card for merchants and customers across Europe, a digital wallet and P2P payments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The initiative is intended to address current shortcomings in cross-border European payments. Despite attempts at payments harmonisation in the Eurozone through developments such as the single euro payments area (SEPA), ten European countries still have national card schemes that do not accept cards from other EU Member States. There is also a growing number of innovative services, such as mobile wallets, that are only offered at the national level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These limitations have hampered the ability to have a consistent B2B payments experience across the continent. The current situation has attracted initiatives from the global card companies and Big Tech firms that aim to overcome the shortcomings of cross-border retail payments by building a new separate payments ecosystem.</p><p>A statement from the banks involved says that the EPI's objective is to offer a digital payment solution that can be used anywhere in Europe and to supersede the fragmented landscape that currently exists. The solution also aims to offer European merchants a seamless, competitive and unified payment solution for the whole of Europe that is also available to all Europeans.</p><p>In addition, the creation of EPI is designed to support the implementation of the political agenda for both European public institutions and national authorities, in particular through the creation of a truly European solution in the fields of payments, banking and technology. The statement from the founder banks says that existing digital payment solutions are fragmented in Europe and the Covid-19 crisis has underlined the need for a unified European digital payment solution. In this sense, EPI also aims to align the European payments ecosystem of banks, merchants, acquirers and payment services providers, thereby contributing to strengthening of the European single market and digital agenda.</p><p>The EPI's implementation phase is expected to materialise in coming weeks through the creation of an interim company in Brussels, Belgium. This will set out deliverables including the completion of the technical and operational roadmap and initiating the implementation work to achieve a best-in-class user experience. The performance of the interim company will be evaluated by each bank before moving on to the EPI's final corporate structure.</p><p>Other payment service providers have also been invited to join the initiative. European market players, individual banks or banking syndicates, as well as third-party payment service providers can apply and join EPI as a founder until the end of 2020. EPI is expected to enter the operational stage in 2022.</p><p>The EPI initiative has been welcomed by the European Central Bank (ECB).</p><p>\"The European Payments Initiative will have to tackle the fragmentation in European retail payments and should encompass all euro area countries, and eventually the entire European Union\", said ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. \"The foreseen effective implementation and a growing number of participants have the potential to strengthen the role of European providers.\"</p><p>The EPI founding members to date are BBVA, BNP Paribas, Groupe BPCE, CaixaBank, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole, Credit Mutuel, Deutsche Bank, Deutscher Sparkassen- und Giroverband, DZ Bank, ING, KBC Group, La Banque Postale, Banco Santander, Societe Generale, and UniCredit.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 COMMERCIAL CARDS AND PAYMENTS LIMITED PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2020</p><p>SECTION 1 COMMERCIAL CARDS AND PAYMENTS LIMITED PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>Commercial Cards and Payments Limited provides online information relating to analysis, research intelligence, and news for the commercial cards and payments industry in the United States and internationally.

Firstly, the sales processes for the insolvent Wirecard AG's core business, the acquiring and issuing business, as well as the independent business units of the group's companies worldwide have been launched. Following a further meeting of the preliminary creditors' committee of Wirecard AG, Michael Jaffe, the preliminary insolvency administrator of Wirecard AG, announced that more than 100 parties have already registered interest.</p><p>After signing a confidentiality agreement, potential investors will soon be able to obtain information via virtual data rooms and start due diligence processes. The aim is to find near-term investment solutions in the interest of creditors, employees and customers.</p><p>Activities for the US company Wirecard North America are the most advanced.

In addition, the solution uses tools such as machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time and reduce false positives. This approach is designed to protect business' finances and minimise negative customer experiences such as payment declines.</p><p>For companies that use the SAP Commerce Cloud to do business, implementation of Smartpay should remove the need to have multiple integrations with different payment providers. In turn, this means that organisations can offer the same payment experience to their customers across all physical, digital and mobile channels.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>July 06: Commercial Cards and Payments Limited: Qolo launches new B2B payments platform</p><p>Qolo launches new B2B payments platform</p><p>Florida-based B2B payments company, Qolo, has launched a new payments system which, according to the company, aims to work by providing comprehensive functionality, improved economics and quicker time to market.

This mornings safe-haven dollar bid also seems to be getting support from EURUSD selling heading into a large 1.1185 option expiry at 10amET and talk of month/quarter/half-year-end USD buying at the London fix (11amET). Dollar/CAD is still struggling to break above its daily downtrend line just above the 1.37 mark, but wed note a bullish triangular consolidation developing on the hourly chart should the 1.3660s hold.</p><p>Canada just reported a slightly less worse than expected contraction to GDP for April (-11.6% vs -13.0%), but datasets like these continue to be backward looking, which explains this mornings trader apathy to the headline.

They were also highly rated by CFRA, mentioning the companys potential for becoming a major disruptor in larger scale services. Overall the fundamental picture showed that SPOT was on the up and up.</p><p>From a technical perspective, we see SPOT on a slight uptrend leading up to Q1 earnings 9see arrows). On the day it opened up its earnings book, we saw something of a runaway gap high volume buying coupled with strong price rejection (inverted hammer) at [1].</p><p>What are we to make of this? Price declined in the following sessions, but two key indicators indicated that such a pullback might have been a strong opportunity to enter a position for either a swing trade or a longer-term investment: that price declined with low selling volume [2] and that it the swing low failed to bounce off the previous swing low at [3]. If anything, this signaled a clear entry opportunity at [2], with a stop loss a few points below [3]. Price continued to rise in the following weeks, held up in a trading range at the end of May. Some swing traders might have taken off their positions at this point, yet considering the low volume at [4], a stop loss at the 175.00 range might have led some to hold positions up until the bearish evening star patterns at [5], where we are now, right before the SPOTs Q2 earnings, where guidance is a bit more tame than in their previous report.</p><p>That said, I can overstress the importance of seeing the fundamental picture before placing a technically-driven trade, as it might help stack the odds in your favor, or perhaps just give you more confidence in your trade.</p><p>June 19: Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.L.C.: The S&amp;P 500 Bull Keeps Climbing the Wall of Worry</p><p>How close to its end is this S&amp;P 500 consolidation are we will the rebound meet its spark? Yesterday's session carries signs of the upcoming move, which I think will be higher. As said yesterday in the battle of narratives, the corona second wave fears still play second fiddle to the recovery hopes, and especially the many programs that push for it. And Treasury Secretary Mnuchin wants the US economy open even if a severe second corona wave really hits.</p><p>Therefore, I think that repairing the real economy damage from the lockdowns, and the grind higher in stocks sometimes slow, and sometimes not so slow will go on.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 17: Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.L.C.: Weather Maps Show Signs of Support</p><p>Grain Markets slid lower in anticipation of larger global supply and demand concerns as coronavirus cases surge higher in some U.S. states. Wheat and corn futures felt pressure as U.S. weather maps improved and harvest of wheat crops in top exporting countries has picked up.</p><p>New coronavirus infections hit record highs in six U.S. states yesterday, marking a rising amount of cases for a second consecutive week as most states moved forward with reopening their economies. Arizona, Florida, Oklahoma, Oregon and Texas all reported record increases in new cases after recording all-time highs last week. Nevada also reported its highest single-day tally of new cases yesterday.</p><p>Prior to 2012, the last time corn ratings fell 4% or more in June was in 2007 (a year with average corn yields). That 7% decline to 70% GTE also happened in the second week of this month. The latest cut to corn conditions was largely driven by deteriorating crops in western states such as Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and the Dakotas, as weather has been unusually hot and dry.</p><p>China sharply ramped up restrictions on people leaving the capital in an effort to stop the most serious coronavirus flare-up since February from spreading to other cities and provinces. The decision to impose fresh curbs and raise the city's emergency response level back to II from III came as Beijing's current outbreak rose to 106 infections since last Thursday.</p><p>Bayer AG said it will scrap a nearly $1 billion project to produce the chemical dicamba in the U.S., but said the move is unrelated to a federal court decision that blocked sales of weed killers based on the product. The company said it is halting work on a new dicamba plant in Luling, Louisiana, because global overcapacity for producing the chemical made the investment less attractive.</p><p>Russia's grain exports will not be subjected to any quotas from July to December, the ag ministry said.</p><p>June 16: Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.L.C.: Crop Ratings Offer a Surprise</p><p>Grain Marketswere higher overnight on the lower than expected crop progress numbers issued by the USDA. Traders will continue to monitor weather forecasts for potential July heat, while looking to 8:00 AM export sales for more sales to China.</p><p>USDA Weekly Crop Progresshad corn good to excellent rating down 4% to now 71%. The trade was expecting no change at 75%. The surprise pushed us away from our four similar rating years of 2014 2016 and 2018. Soybean ratings were left unchanged at 72% GTE, just as trade expected. Winter wheat ratings slipped 1% to now 50% GTE. Spring wheat ratings fell 1% this week to 81%. The trade was expecting no change in both wheat products.</p><p>May NOPA crushof 169.584 million bushels missed the 173.071 trade expectation. This was still a strong one and was a record for any previous May. It was 9.6% over last years low number.USDA expects crush in this old crop year at 2.3% over last year.

This unleashed a wave of, technically damaging, USD selling into the London close; and wed chalk up the quiet USD bid in late NY/Asian trade as a simple response to 10s crawling back above 0.82%. A resumption of pre-Fed meeting bond buying then pressured the US 10yr yield down to the 0.79% handle during European trade this morning and this has brought about a shaky-looking NY open for the broader USD.</p><p>Its all been about yield curve control speculation this week in our opinion. Will the Federal Reserve adjust its unlimited, arguably reckless, shot-gun style approach to quantitative easing in favor of amore efficient, Japanese-style, rules-based approach which targets the level of a government bond yield? The Reserve Bank of Australia did this recently by setting a 0.25% target for Australias 3-year bond yield and funnily enough the RBA was actually less active in bond markets since they made the announcement in March. While there are obvious externalities to consider in their limited use case(ie. all the stimulus that other world central banks did at the same time), a couple Fed members have hinted lately that theyre thinking about pegging yields as well. NYFed President John Williams said on May 27ththat the Fed was thinking very hard about this and while the Feds Loretta Mester said on May 29ththat she doesnt think the central bank is close to a decision on targeting yields, she did admit to it being a tool worthwhile thinking about for a future phase of monetary policy. None of this really mattered when US yields were trading comatose in a tight, two-month, rangebut bond markets have been speculating that this is now seriously on the Feds mind since nominal yields and the yield curve all of sudden spiked higher last week.</p><p>A quick survey of market chatter/analyst expectations this morning suggests that the FOMC will not surprise markets today with a new yield curve control (YCC) target.</p><p>June 08: Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.L.C.: China Keeps Buying U.S. Soybeans</p><p>Grain Market continued pushing higher after a weekend with hot temperatures and little precipitation.

Typically, Argentina's largest export months are December through March; the pace this year is even faster than normal with exports totaling more than 6 million tons, a record for December and January combined. Exporters were motivated to move wheat quickly based on expectations of looming policy changes.</p><p>In December, Argentina's newly elected government raised the export tax for wheat from approximately 7 percent to 12 percent. Before the crop was harvested, however, exporters had already aggressively sold much of the projected exportable supplies, anticipating the higher tax rate. Once the sales were made and the supplies procured from producers, the export tax was fixed in advance of shipping the product. i</p><p>With such a large supply sold in advance, shipments surged once the supplies became available. Given that nearly all of Argentina's 2019/20 wheat shipments had already been committed before the December tax increase, that action is expected to have little effect on 2019/20 exports. Early indications are that February shipments are back to seasonally normal levels. Over the next few months, exports seem likely to wane seasonally.</p><p>Argentina exports wheat to a variety of markets. Brazil is a year-round destination for Argentina, buying consistently to fulfill its needs. The United States and other suppliers may make some inroads into Brazil with the newly applied 750,000-ton tariff-rate quota in place, but Argentina is set to continue as the dominant supplier.</p><p>In peak export months, Argentine wheat is competitive enough to reach a variety of other markets in Africa and Asia. Recently, Argentine exports to Southeast Asia (particularly Indonesia, Thailand, and Bangladesh) have flourished in light of tight Australian supplies.</p><p>March 08: Little Sioux Corn Processors, L.L.C.: Retail Earnings Estimates and Revisions</p><p>In the spreadsheet above I have tracked the earnings estimates for the Retail Sector ETF (XRT) top 30 weighted stocks.</p><p>The column under the date 3/8/2020 has a letter that represents the movement in 2020 earnings estimates since the most recent print (1/8/2020).
