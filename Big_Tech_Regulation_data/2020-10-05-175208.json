Along with glass scattered[2] in front of its entrance, at least four bullet holes were discovered inside the office. Law enforcement is investigating the scene, where the office is part of a strip mall close by the Reed Canal Park.South Daytona police Capt. Mark Cheatham says no one was injured during the vandalism. </p><p>Cheatham believes the shooting likely occurredbetween 4 p.m. EST Sunday and early Monday morning.'At this point we can confirm that at least four rounds were fired into the building,' the police captain told[3] reporters. 'We are working to see if we can get video from nearby businesses but so far we have no witnesses.' 'We have never had any kind of vandalism before at a Republican Headquarters,' Volusia County Republican Party chairmanTony Ledbetter told[4] theDaytona Beach News-Journal. 'It's a small strip center and no other business was vandalized, so it was obviously politically motivated.' Reacting to the incident, Florida State Rep. Tom Leek issued[5] the following statement:'The state of our political discourse in America is an embarrassment to all parties and those involved in the political process. Neither Democrats nor Republicans own the high ground on this issue. Sooner or later, both parties are going to have to stop suffering idiots within their own party, and cast them out on their own.' Earlier this month,Antifa activists targeted[6] theMetropolitan Republican Club in Manhattan in a politically motivated attack. The far-left vandalsspray-painted ananarchist symbol on the club's doors and smashed its windows.'Our attack is merely a beginning. We are not passive, we are not civil, and we will not apologize,' a letter left by Antifa read. 'Those of good conscience and clear mind know this state of oppression cannot remain.'

CNN 'New Day' host Alisyn Camerota asked the Tree of Life rabbi if he blamed anyone 'beyond the gunman' for the attack. Myers instead blamed hate. 'I don't really foist blame upon any person,' Myers told Camerota. 'Hate does not know religion, race, creed, political party. It's not a political issue in any way, shape, or form. Hate does not know any of those things.' Camerota then questioned, 'What lights the match of hate?' Myers replied, 'I think you're raising one of those great questions that people far smarter than I can answer.' Later in the interview, Camerota pressed the rabbi and asked if he wanted President Donald Trump to come. 'The president of the United States is always welcome,' said Myers. 'I'm a citizen, he is my president. He is certainly welcome.'

MSNBC's Heilemann: Trump 'Is Obviously a Racist' \u2014 He 'Obviously Condones Anti-Semitism'[12] Pam Key Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Monday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe,' network political analyst John Heilemann declared President Donald Trump was 'obviously a racist.' During the discussion of the mail bombs sent to political figures and CNN's offices, hostJoe Scarborough said, 'I can't even call him president, this demagogue, this nationalist, he refused to even try to temper his crowds. Refused to even call the former presidents and secretaries of states and CIA directors to offer condolences and assurances that he was going to do his job as president to protect all Americans.' Heilemann said, 'What he said was \u2014and they are, I believe, the two most kinds of landmark signal repulsive words of last week, which were 'I'll pass.' When the president was asked on Friday after the bomber had been, or the alleged bomber had been arrested, when asked whether he was planning to call Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton and the other people who had bombs sent to them, the president stood on White House grounds and said 'I'll pass.' That's what he said about that. That sends a signal that is as profound as anything that the president could say.' He continued, 'The president is obviously a racist, he's obviously a demagogue. He obviously condones anti-Semitism, stokes up nationalist hatred.' He added, 'You asked what's happened at Fox News? What's happened is the same thing that's happened to the Republican Party. What's happened to it is they were both corrupt, bankrupt institutions that were hollowed out and waiting to be taken over by Donald Trump. They have now been taken over by Donald Trump, and they are in a much worse, much uglier place than they were five years ago, ten years ago.' The video[13] Democrat Menendez Supporter Hurls Racial Slurs at African-American, Latino Republicans[14] Oh, the hypocrisy Dave Kyle Morris Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 A supporter of Democrat Bob Menendez (D-NJ) was caught on camera spewing racist insults at African-American and Latino Republicans at a New Jersey Senate debate last Wednesday in Newark, NJ. The video, captured by the Republican National Committee, shows an African-American man holding a Menendez campaign sign telling a Latino Republican,'You're going to be deported. You're going to be sent back to your hometown. Believe that.' 'You are a coon, man. You have to go,' said the Menedez supporter to the African-American Republican. 'You gotta go. You have to go.' Amidst the racial slurs, the African-American Republican asks the Menendez supporter to 'name one stance' of Menendez's that he supports. The Menendez supporter does not respond and continues to hurl insults at the Republican. Near the end of the video, the Menendez supporter can be heard saying, 'I'm gonna stand here, but you gotta go.' The video[15] Democrat Running in Mollie Tibbetts District Voted to Keep Sanctuary Cities[16] John Binder Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 DemocratAbby Finkenauer, running against Rep. Rod Blum in Iowa's 1st Congressional District, voted to keep sanctuary cities in the state to protect criminal illegal aliens from deportation from the United States. While Blum has opposed sanctuary cities, illegal immigration, and supports President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border,Finkenauer joined[17] her Democrat colleagues in Iowa's state House by voting to keep sanctuary jurisdictions in the state that gave protection to criminal illegal aliens. A recent attack ad notedFinkenauer's support for sanctuary cities. The Democrat's vote against the state's sanctuary city ban, which Gov.

Fitton: 'Elaborately Planned' Caravan Attracts Human Traffickers and Gangbangers[22] This report raises an interesting point that few in the U.S. have consideredThis orchestrated 'caravan' is also a destabilizing force in the countriesthe 'migrants' originate from  It basically labels these countries as uninhabitable, which is not true Dave Tom Fitton Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Washington, DC - The caravan moving north toward our border is a serious threat to the sovereignty of the United States. It is a blatant challenge to the rule of law. For this reason, we sent our Director of Investigations and Research Chris Farrell and Judicial Watch Investigator Reporter Irene Garcia to Guatemala to uncover the truth about 'caravan.' Here is theirfirst report[23]in our Corruption Chronicles blog: The migrant caravan marching northbound through Central America is an 'elaborately planned' movement that's benefiting human smugglers and bringing disturbing numbers of violent gang members and other criminal elements through Guatemala, according to government sources in the capital city. 'MS-13 gang members have been detained and coyotes (human smugglers) are joining the march with clients who pay to get smuggled into the United States,' a Guatemalan official told Judicial Watch. People from Asian countries waiting to get smuggled into the U.S. through Central America are also integrating with poor Hondurans in the caravan, a high-level Guatemalan government source confirmed. Among them are nationals of Bangladesh, a south Asian Islamic country that's well known as a recruiting ground for terrorist groups such as ISIS and Al-Qaeda Indian Subcontinent (AQIS). 'There are lots of dirty businesses associated with this,' Guatemalan authorities told Judicial Watch. 'There's lots of human trafficking.' Between Honduras and Mexico, Guatemala has been overrun with the onslaught of migrants that began their journey last week in the northern Honduran city of San Pedro Sula. At last count around 7,000 have participated in the trek, a great deal of themrowdy, angry men ages 17 to 40[24].[25]President Jimmy Morales has ordered the military and police to detain all of the migrants and facilitate their safe return back to Honduras, though thousands have already reached the Mexican border. In a morning interview with Judicial Watch at the Guatemalan Ministry of Defense, Secretary of Defense General Luis Miguel Ralda Moreno said more than 2,000 Hondurans have been sent back home on buses. 'We're doing everything possible to stop the caravan while still respecting human rights,' General Moreno said. During an afternoon interview at the National Palace, President Morales said that Guatemala has absorbed the huge cost of mobilizing police and military to return thousands of people to Honduras. He would like the United States to help him find the organizers of the caravan so they can face legal consequences. 'Mass immigration like this endangers lives,' Morales said. 'This is unprecedented. We are in the process of investigating who is behind the caravan.' Morales assures that Guatemala is doing everything possible to curb illegal immigration and asked for cooperation from the United States. It has been a delicate and complicated task, Guatemalan officials say, because the caravan is a very organized movement that has been well orchestrated. There are rest points along the route with food, water and shelter for the migrants as well as medical care in some areas. 'It's very strategic and extremely organized,' a Guatemalan government source told Judicial Watch. 'It is very complex, not a simple march. There is nothing spontaneous about it.' During a visit to the Guatemalan-Honduran border this week Judicial Watch interviewed multiple migrants who repeated the same rehearsed line when asked who organized the caravan, insisting it was a spontaneous event even though there were clearly organizers shouting instructions in Spanish and putting select persons in front of cameras for interviews. All of them said the caravan was not about politics but rather poverty. Guatemalan officials disagree, estimating that the caravan is a movement of radicalized forces to destabilize Central American countries. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernndez, a conservative, echoes that assessment. In a localnewspaper report[26]published last week Hernndez asserted that leftist interests seeking to destabilize the country are manipulating migrants.Women and children are being used without regard to the risks to their lives, Hernndez said. 'The irregular mobilization was organized for political reasons to negatively affect the governance and image of Honduras and to destabilize the peace of neighboring countries,' the president said, adding that many have returned to the country after realizing they've been fooled More[27]  Donald Trump Warns Caravan Migrants: 'Our Military Is Waiting for You'[28] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 President Donald Trump issued another warning on Monday to migrants in the caravan traveling through Mexico, telling them they would not be allowed into the United States. 'This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!' Trump warned on Twitter. Trump commented after the Pentagon revealed[29]that up to 5,000 active duty troops would be deployed to the Southern border to stop the caravan, now estimated to include 7,000 people from various South American countries. 'Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,' Trump wrote. He urged the migrants in the caravan to return to their home countries and apply for legal entry into the United States. 'Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process,' he wrote More[30] Trump to Expand Military Border Deployment from 800 to 5,000[31] Bob Price Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Reports on Monday indicate that President Donald Trump will order an expansion of the U.S. military deployment to the U.S. southwest border. The order is expected to increase the number of troops being deployed from 800 to 5,000. TheWall Street Journal reported[32] on Monday morning that the U.S. military plans to deploy 5,000 troops to the southwest border region in response to the caravan of 'would-be asylum seekers.' The plans reportedly call for 1,800 troops to deploy to Texas, 1,700 to Arizona, and 1,500 to California Under 'Operation FaithfulPatriot,' troops are expected to be assigned to ports of entry in the early phase. They are expected to support Border Patrol agents and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers in dealing with the anticipated migrant caravan arrivals. The troops are expected to come from about ten U.S. Army installations. The composition of the forces is expected to include military police, engineers, and medical personnel. CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said his agency is updating 'longstanding plans to deal with a mass migration situation.' Those plans include temporary holding and processing facilities, he said. McAleenan plans to ensure the CBP can 'secure the ports and prevent a large group from coming at one time.' Over the weekend, Mexican authorities offered to provide asylum, jobs, and education and health benefits to the migrants in the Central American caravan headed north from Guatemala, Breitbart News' Ildefonso Ortiz and Brandon Darby reported[33]. The migrants soundly rejected the offer \u2014 instead, they stated their intention to migrate to the U.S. Thank you but no was the response from a group of migrants in Arriaga, Mexico. 'No, we're heading north.' On Sunday, Ortiz reported[34] that another caravan of migrants violently stormed the Guatemalan northern border in an attempt to force their way into Mexico. Video reports from the border showed the migrants throwing rocks and other projectiles at Guatemalan border authorities. The group eventually broke through the Guatemalan border gate but appeared to be blocked from entering the Mexican port of entry More[35] Pentagon Deploying Over 5,200 Troops to Southwestern Border to Stop Migrant Caravans[36] Kristina Wong Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 The Pentagon is deploying more than 5,200 active duty troops to the southwestern U.S. border to stop caravans of migrants from crossing over illegally, U.S. officials announced Monday at a press conference. 'By the end of this week will we deploy over 5,200 soldiers to the southwest border. That is just the start of this operation. We'll continue to adjust the numbers and inform you of those,' Air Force Gen.Terrence O'Shaughnessy, commander of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said. The 5,200 troops would add to the 2,092 National Guard members already deployed to the border earlier this year. Officials confirmed that the troops who would normally carry weapons will bring their weapons with them to the border. Officials say there are at least two migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border. 'As of this afternoon, we continue to track a large group of approximately 3,500 traveling through southern Mexico with the stated intent to reach the U.S. border,' saidKevin McAleenan, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner. He said the group was near the Chiapas-Oaxaca border in southern Mexico. 'We are also aware of a second large group[37] of migrants at the CiudadHidalgo border crossing between Guatemala and Mexico. Size estimate for the second group is around 3,000,' he said. 'They're incentivized to try to cross our border by the gaps in our legal framework, and the expectation that they will be allowed to stay. This means, at any given moment, there are tens of thousands of intending migrants between the Guatemala border and the U.S. border moving towards us.' McAleenan said within that flow were about 17,000 criminals last year, along with 'hardened smugglers' and people from over 100 different countries from around the world. But he said the caravan phenomenon 'new and challenging.' More[38] Trump: We Will Hold Asylum Seekers in Tent Cities Until Their Trial[39] Ian Hanchett Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018  During an interview broadcast on Monday's edition of the Fox News Channel's 'Ingraham Angle,' President Trump stated that asylum applicants will be held in tent cities until their hearing takes place, and people with rejected asylum applications will 'get out.'  Trump stated, 'If they apply for asylum, we're going to hold them until such time as their trial takes place We're going to put up \u2014 we're going to build tent cities. We're going to have tents. They're going to be very nice, and they're going to wait, and if they don't get asylum, they get out.'

As Breitbart News has chronicled, migrants with an at least 7,000-strong caravan have repeatedly admitted that they are traveling to the U.S. toseek jobs[43], re-enter the U.S. as previouslydeported[44]illegal aliens, andflee crime[45]. One previously deported illegal alien with the caravan even admitted that he was convicted[46] of attempted murder in the U.S. None of these cases are eligible asylum claims. The UN Refugee Agency, though, is commanding Trump to accept the caravan of refugees, which some estimates now put at 10,000-strong. In an interview[47] with Voice of America, a spokesman for the UN Refugee Agency said: 'Our position globally is that the individuals who are fleeing persecution and violence need to be given access to territory and protection including refugee status and determination procedure. And, if the people who are fleeing persecution and violence enter Mexico, they need to be provided access to the Mexican asylum system and those entering the United States need to be provided access to the American asylum system.' [Emphasis added] As Breitbart News[48] reported, the UN Refugee Agency is aiding the caravan of migrants, putting 45 UN workers on the ground with the group of Central Americans. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order this week that will halt the caravan entering the U.S. on the legal grounds of national security. Currently, the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants every year, with more than 70 percent coming to the country through theprocess[49]known as 'chain migration,' whereby newly naturalized citizens are allowed to bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the country. Since 2000,more than 1.5 million[50]foreign refugees have been resettled across the U.S. \u2014 outpacing the population of Philadelphia. Also, there have been more than4.1 million[51]legal immigrants admitted to the U.S. from refugee-producing countries since 2000 More[52] Trump Plans Executive Order to End Birthright Citizenship in US[53]: The move will likely provoke legal challenges, and it escalates the president's tough stance on immigration ahead of the midterm elections Khashoggi's Killing Should Be a Nuclear Red Flag[54]: The Saudis can't be trusted to enrich uranium and reprocess spent fuel. Jamie Fly and Henry Sokolski The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  If the Saudi government's prevarications about Jamal Khashoggi's murder teach us anything, it should be that there are limits to how far the U.S. can trust Riyadh. In particular, America shouldn't trust Saudi Arabia with nuclear technology. The Obama administration's nuclear agreement with Iran allowed Tehran to possess and develop nuclear power and uranium-enrichment technology and expertise. President Trump rightly scrapped the Iran nuclear deal. But last fall, in its desire to improve relations with Riyadh, the administration began negotiating a deal with Saudi Arabia that would grant it similar nuclear privileges.  Some have argued that the administration should exploit the U.S. friendship with the kingdom to challenge Iran the way President Reagan challenged the Soviet Union. Yet the brutal murder of Khashoggi and the government's ever-changing explanations are a reminder that in the Middle East of 2018, America lacks the strong network of democratic allies united in common purpose that helped bring down the Berlin Wall and the Soviet Union. Washington needs to temper its confidence in certain regional partners that share U.S. concerns about Iran. Like Cold War allies, America's Arab friends are on the front lines. But because of their political systems, their primary goal is maintaining an authoritarian grip on their populations. Their interests and America's will thus, at times, diverge. Their actions, such as the killing of Khashoggi, can also significantly undermine the strategic and moral case the U.S. makes against Iranian aggression. Consider, too, the risk of regime change if there is nuclear power in Saudi Arabia. Nuclear reactors operate for 40 years or more and are far more dangerous than any conventional arms sales. In the 1970s, the U.S. considered selling the shah of Iran 23 reactors. That would have been a colossal mistake. Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, have publicly threatened to violate the Kingdom's Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty commitment not to acquire nuclear weapons if they believe Iran is acquiring them. The U.S. has never negotiated a nuclear cooperation agreement with a country threatening to get nuclear weapons More[55] NBC's Kate Snow Says Info Clearing Kavanaugh Wasn't 'Newsworthy' Before Confirmation[56] John Nolte Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 NBC's Kate Snow offers only falsehoods and double talk to explain why she and her employer hid crucial facts that would have cleared then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of gang rape allegations. On Friday, Breitbart News reported[57] that, although NBC had the information a full week prior to his October 6 confirmation, NBC covered up news that would have cleared Kavanaugh when it mattered most \u2014 during those intense final days of the confirmation process. During that week, here is the information NBC News hid from the public and those senators deciding on whether or not to confirm Kavanaugh: On September 30, the woman who signed a sworn statement corroborating Julie Swetnick's gang rape allegations against Kavanaugh (the statement was publicly released by attorney Michael Avenatti on October 2), not only told NBC she had never witnessed Kavanaugh spike punch or rape anyone, she also became something of a character witness for Kavanaugh when she told NBC she had never once seen him behave inappropriately. This second witness then told NBC on October 3 (three days prior to Kavanaugh's confirmation) that Aven-atti had fabricated her sworn statement. During this crucial time, Avenatti was playing games with NBC to conceal all of this \u2014 what NBC itself describes as 'an apparent effort to thwart the reporting process[.]' Nothing was stopping NBC from reporting the above facts as they came in. There was no valid reason for NBC to withhold this relevant and crucial information, either from the public or from those senators still deciding Kavanaugh's fate. What's more, had NBC released this story as it broke, NBC would have owned a major scoop, a story of national consequence. Instead, NBC chose not to reveal the truth until October 26, more than three weeks after it mattered. The only plausible explanation for this is partisanship. NBC did not want Kavanaugh confirmed, so the truth was withheld and the public misled, even as \u2014 and this is important \u2014 NBC chose to spread a number of uncorroborated smears and hoaxes against Kavanaugh (which I will detail below). Here is Snow's explanation in full, a collection of her tweets[58], which I have numbered for clarity More[59] Kavanaugh Accuser Christine Blasey Ford Rakes in $1 Million, Several Book Offers[60]: Christine Blasey Ford, the California psychology professor who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct 36 years ago, received a $1 million windfall and is receiving several requests for book deals after her testimony. Julia Ioffe Apologizes After Saying Trump Radicalized More People than ISIS[61] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 GQ writer Julia Ioffe quickly apologized Monday after claiming that President Trump had radicalized more people than ISIS on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper.  'I think, you know, this president, one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization, and this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did,' Julia Ioffe said. 'That's justit's unconscionable for you to say that,' CNN's David Urban shot back. 'The way he talks-the way that he allows thesethe way he winks and nods to these groups. The way he says, 'I know I'm not supposed to say it, but I'm a nationalist.' The way that he hems and haws, when he has to condemn these people, and kind of, gritting his teeth, kind of, says, fine, okay, 'I condemn this.'' 'For you not to push back on that, is irresponsible,' Urban said to Jake Tapper. 'That'sirresponsible. For her to say that the President of the United States has radicalized more people than ISIS is irresponsible.' Urban continued to push Ioffe on what she based her claim on. She responded, 'ISIS had, like 10,000 members. I think the president has far more supporters who espouse an equally hateful ideology.' Tapper, as panelist David Urban pointed out on air, did not push back on Ioffe's assertion whatsoever More[62] Watch: Sarah Sanders Battles CNN's Acosta-CNN Responds in Tweet Attacking Sanders[63] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 White House press secretary Sarah Sanders battled CNN's Jim Acosta during the press briefing Monday over President Trump's tweets about the 'fake news media' being 'the enemy of the people,' leading to CNN's PR team coming after Sanders on Twitter. Acosta asked Sanders if Trump'sclaim[64] that the 'fake news media' is the 'enemy of the people' would include CNN. 'There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open ...vious hostility ...port the news accurately ...irly,' Trump tweeted Monday 'Would that include my outlet, which received bombs last week?' he asked. 'I don't think it's necessarily specific to a general, broad generalization of a full outlet. At times, I think there's individuals that the president would be referencing,' Sanders said. Acosta: 'So you're not going to state for the record, then-I mean, if the president is going to say the fake news media are the 'enemy of the people' and if you're going to stand there and continue to say that there are some journalists, some news outlets in this country that meet that characterization, shouldn't you have the guts, Sarah, to state, which outlets, which journalists are the enemy of the people?' 'I think it's, irresponsible of a news organization like yours to blame responsibility of a pipe bomb that was not sent by the president-not just blame the president, but blame members of his administration for those heinous acts. I think that is outrageous and I think it's irresponsible,' Sanders said CNN's communications department then hit back against Sanders' claims on their Twitter account. 'No @PressSec, CNN did not say @realDonaldTrump was directly responsible for the bomb sent to our office by his ardent and emboldened supporter.

It is as if Cromwell doesn't even know what the meaning of 'totalitarian[73]' is One thing's for sure: It is Cromwell who wants blood to flow in the streets Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Before he was honored at the 4th annualCarney Awards Sunday evening, Actor James Cromwell warned that the United States will experience another a 'revolution' with 'blood in the streets' unless President Donald Trump's agenda is thwarted. 'This is nascent fascism. We always had a turnkey, totalitarian state \u2014 all we needed was an excuse, and all the institutions were in place to turn this into pure fascism,' James Cromwell said[74] in an interview withVariety.'If we don't stop [President Trump] now, then we will have a revolution for real. Then there will be blood in the streets.' During hisacceptance later in the evening, the Babe star spoke about the importance of voting during the fast-approaching midterm election. 'We're living in very curious times, and something is coming up which is desperately important to this country and to this planet, and that is an election, in which hopefully in some measure we are going to take back our democracy,' Cromwell told[75] attendees. 'We will have a government that represents us and not the donor class. We will cut through the corruption, we won't have to do what comes next, which is either a non-violent revolution or a violent one, because this has got to end.'

Prominent members of the anti-socialist opposition in Venezuela congratulated Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Monday for his election victory this weekend[78].

Undercover Video: Kyrsten Sinema's Campaign Manager Lists Gun Controls She Supports[80] Awr Hawkins Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 An undercover video released by Project Veritas shows Democrat Kyrsten Sinema's campaign manager listing all the gun controls Sinema supports. The campaign manager, Michelle Davidson, made clear that Kyrsten Sinema's approach is to avoid talking about her gun control positions until the election is over. Davidson said[81]: 'We can't be talking about an assault weapon ban. We can't, right? The conversation that she can lead is how do we get to a place where we can, background checks, right? Can we fix that system? We've got to fix the gun show loophole, we have to fix the background check system. We've got to make it harder for people who have been convicted of domestic violence and other violent crimes to get guns \u2014 I mean those are the conversations we can have.'

We were told to email her communications director, Nick Zeller, which we did numerous times to no avail. In the emails, we asked Zeller if Sinema still wants to require a license for all gun owners \u2014 On The Issuesreports[86]that she expressed support for 'gun licenses' in 2006 \u2014 and we also asked if she supported an 'assault weapons' ban. Zeller did not respond. We also asked if she still wanted to expand background checks, as she was one of 194 Democrats whocosponsored[87]background check gun control in 2017. Zeller did not answer that question either. But Davidson, Sinema's campaign manager, unwittingly answered the question in a Project Veritas undercover video. Davidson indicates Kyrsten Sinema will not only lead the conversation on background checks but on new regulations for gun shows and new prohibitions for gun possession More[88] Christian News Site 'LifeSite' Blacklisted by Web Host[89] This censorship is getting out of handWe are going to need some new antidiscrimination laws Dave Charlie Nash Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 LifeSite, a Christian pro-life news outlet, was allegedly blacklisted by its web host and given just 12 hours to find another host the website, or risk being offline. 'LifeSite just received an email at 8:30 p.m. EST from our web-hosting company alerting us that they will be taking our website down within 12 hours, if not sooner,' claimed LifeSite in a statement[90], Saturday. 'We received absolutely no forewarning whatsoever about this decision Our web developer is scrambling right now to set up a possibly-needed temporary solution to keep the website live. However, we're going to have to go through the ordeal and expense of moving server companies,' the news outlet continued. 'We also intend to fight these attacks, which will carry significant legal costs.' In an update made following the original statement, LifeSite added, 'Our web developer was up all night implementing temporary measures to keep our site online even if our current web-hosting company followed through on its threat to shut down our services. We are extremely grateful for his hard work on a Saturday night. However, this is only a temporary solution. We are currently looking for a web-hosting company that will not cave to threats of this kind.' On its website[91], LifeSite describes itself as a 'non-profit Internet service dedicated to issues of culture, life, and family,' launchedby the pro-life Campaign Life Coalition in 1997, which 'emphasizes the social worth of traditional Judeo-Christian principles but is also respectful of all authentic religions and cultures that esteem life, family and universal norms of morality.' LifeSite was not the only website blacklisted by its web host this week, with free speech social network Gab losing[92] its web host Joyent late on Saturday and being given until just Monday morning to migrate to another host. On Saturday, Gab claimed the blacklisting could leave the social network offline for weeks, and as of writing, Gab is currently offline. 'As we transition to a new hosting provider Gab will be inaccessible for a period of time. We are working around the clock to get Gab.com back online,' declared the social network in a statement. 'Thank you and remember to speak freely.' More[93] Left-Wing 'Deplatform Hate' Threatens Payment Processor Stripe over Terms of Service[94] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Deplatform Hate, a far-left Twitter account, seemed to blackmail Big Tech payment processing service Stripe on Saturday, threatening the company unless it changed its terms of service to the account's liking, and posting messages with Stripe' General Counsel showing the two parties discussing the blacklisting of free speech social network Gab. Deplatform Hate claimed it would release all communications with the company unless it changed its terms of service to the account's liking\u2014 which would most likely be aimed at removing more conservatives from utilizing the payment processor's services. 'We're releasing all comms with @stripe, and [Stripe general counsel Jon Zieger] Tuesday unless they make a statement changing their terms of service,' warned[95] the account. 'They have several violent orgs they're supporting and blood will be on their hands again.' The account also released[96] several friendly messages with Stripe general counsel Jon Zieger, showing Zieger and Deplatform Hate talking about blacklisting Gab (which was recently banned[97] from the service), and revealing Zieger's interest in further talking to Deplatform Hate via a phone call. 'I'd be interested in learning more about your concerns and how you think we can do better,' declared Zieger in one message to Deplatform Hate. 'Would you have any time for a phone call in the next few days?' In another message, Deplatform Hate wrote to Zieger, 'Good call on gab You dropping them was a big precondition of chatting. If this was goodwill I can meet you halfway and chat. Goodwill on my side is that there's going to be two more big hits this October you should know about.' 'I'd be happy to chat and would certainly appreciate the heads up,' replied Zieger. 'Let me know what would be a good way to connect.' The exchange did not clarify what the two 'big hits' Deplatform Hate referred to are. Shortly after making the posts, Deplatform Hate set its account to private, however, despite the clear evidence of a threat, Twitter has yet to suspend the account More[98] As Israel Targets Iran in Syria, U.S. Officials Warn of Reprisals[99]: White House applauds strikes but military worries about retaliation against American forces Gordon Lubold and Felicia Schwartz The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014Israel has been conducting an aggressive military campaign across Syria against Iran-backed militia groups, an effort that has been encouraged by the White House but aroused the concern of many U.S. military officials. While the White House has applauded Israel's assertiveness against Iran inside Syria, the military officials say they fear it could backfire if Iran's belief that the U.S. is behind many of the strikes prompts Iran-backed groups to attack American troops in Syria or Iraq. 'It's a growing concern for us,' said a senior military official. Israel has struck about 200 targets in Syria[100] over the past 18 months, Israeli officials disclosed recently, both to block weapons shipments from Iran to Lebanese group Hezbollah and to prevent Iran from establishing a permanent military presence inside Syria. The targets included shipments of advanced weapons, military bases and infrastructure, the officials said. The Pentagon said Israel is working on its own. 'Israeli operations are independent,' said Cmdr. Sean Robertson, a Pentagon spokesman, in response to questions about the issue. 'However, we support Israel's inherent right to self-defense against imminent threats.' Cmdr. Robertson said that if an action on the battlefield puts U.S. military personnel at risk, commanders 'would take appropriate measures,' and that 'U.S. forces are always prepared to defend themselves.'  The White House position has been that Israel has the right to defend itself and, further, that the U.S. welcomes Israel's attempt to thwart Iran's effort to create an 'arc of control' leading from Iran west through Iraq, Syria and, ultimately, Lebanon. 'Iran and Hezbollah cannot be allowed to build an arsenal of weapons on Israel's border that threatens the region,' a White House spokeswoman said in a statement At the Pentagon, however, U.S. military officials have expressed greater alarm. Their concern is that Iran believes the Israeli strikes stem from American intelligence fed to the Israelis specifically so they will launch the attacks. If convinced of U.S. involvement, Iran could orchestrate reprisal attacks against American forces, particularly in Iraq, these officials said, where there are more than 5,000 U.S. troops stationed in the fight against Islamic State More[101] Iranian Port Project Poses a Dilemma for US[102]: Chabahar facility is the type of project Washington aims to curb, but doing so would hinder efforts to bolster India and Afghanistan Bill Spindle and Rajesh Roy The Wall Street Journal Oct. 28, 2018  A port being developed in the southern Iranian city of Chabahar underscores some of the dilemmas U.S. policy makers face in implementing sanctions against Tehran. Strategically located on the Gulf of Oman and named for an Iranian revolutionary war hero, the Shahid Beheshti Port is exactly the sort of Iranian economic development the Trump administration wants to stop with sanctions that kick in on Nov. 5. Those measures aim to punish Iran for what the U.S. sees as unacceptable behavior in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere. They follow the Trump administration's decision this year to withdraw from an international deal struck with Iran in 2015 to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Once completed, the port\u2014a small part of which started initial operations in December\u2014could help Iran by strengthening economic ties with South and Central Asia, providing an export point for its oil beyond the Persian Gulf and functioning as a strategic military asset. But it could also be a critical economic lifeline for Afghanistan, where the U.S. has tried for 16 years to strengthen and stabilize the government so thousands of U.S. troops can come home. The port also could be a big boon to India, an increasingly close partner of the U.S. in Asia. India wants Chabahar port activities exempted from sanctions. Indian companies are mostly equipping and operating the facility. If the port is completed, they are expected to be among the biggest users of the port in order to participate in the reconstruction of Afghanistan\u2014something the Trump administration has asked India to get more involved in\u2014and establish a stronger economic presence in Central Asia. 'There's such a strong case to be made in terms of India's ability to create lines of communications and transport up to Afghanistan,' said Richard Rossow, a South Asia expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 'But you just never know if it's going to pique interest in the White House one day and suddenly things change.' Sanctions law allows the president to grant exemptions for projects intended to help reconstruct Afghanistan, one way the port development could continue. The Trump administration hasn't decided whether to grant exemptions, but has said the intent of sanctions isn't to punish Afghanistan or India. High-level Iranian, Indian and Afghan officials also have been shuttling among their respective capitals in recent months to find ways to carry on the work even if no exemptions are granted. That may include making payments through a mechanism European countries are trying to devise to continue doing business with Iran despite U.S. sanctions. The Chabahar port has long been seen as a potential way around Pakistan, a sworn enemy of India that believes holding sway over Afghanistan is critical to its own security. Pakistan has squelched trade between India and Afghanistan across its territory. It wants Afghanistan to eventually transport goods through a competing Pakistani port on the Gulf of Oman that is being developed with China More[103] Expert: 'Significant Risk' Libya Will Become Second Islamic State 'Caliphate'[104] Libya is in bad, bad shape Isn't it interesting that Obama's Libyan intervention debaclenever gets attention in the mainstream media? Dave Edwin Mora Breitbart News 29 Oct 2018 Libya, located a few hundred miles from the European coast, is facing a 'significant risk' of becoming the 'new' home of the Islamic State's 'caliphate,' a London-based expert from the Chatham House think-tank's Royal Institute of International Affairs cautioned in an editorial published by the Dallas Morning News on Sunday. Frank Kryza wrote[105]: 'Boots on the ground' is a phrase rarely used by the Trump Administration. And with good reason: 6,251 American soldiers have been killed since 2001; some 45,170 have been wounded. That is a heavy price. We are already too involved in combating ISIS in Syria and Iraq. But if we do nothing, Libya will cease to exist as a country. Imagine, if you can, an Islamic caliphate on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea not far from Italy. It is a grim vision. Kryza's warning came as suspected fighters from the Islamic State, or ISIS, killed four people and wounded seven in central Libya on Sunday, according[106] to Nigeria's Punch newspaper. Soon after U.S.-backed forces pushed ISIS out of its former stronghold in the coastal Libyan city of Sirte, once considered the group's largest bastion outside Iraq and Syria, American[107] and Libyan[108] officials warned about a potential resurgence[109] of the terrorist group, noting that the jihadists were regrouping elsewhere in Libya, namely the desert valleys and inland hills southeast of the country.  In April, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) cautioned that ISIS remains a 'potent[110]' menace in Libya. Kryza, who serves as Tunisia's honorary consul resident in Dallas, pointed out on Sunday that Libya's descent into chaos following the U.S.-backed overthrow and execution of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 is providing a fertile ground for ISIS to flourish More[111] Claim: Germany's Angela Merkel To Step Down From Party Leadership After Humiliating Elections[112].

Dave Dems, Left Wing Media Claim Russian Hacking an 'Act of War'[2] Remember when Democrats used to be the party of peace-lovers? Remember how outraged they were at George W. Bush's Iraq war which they initially voted for? America has always been reluctant to declare war Throughout the entire Cold War, we never declared war on Russia though they did far worse than anything alleged today And yet Democrats and their media allies are making claims that, if taken seriously, would result in a declaration of war  As usual, the Democrats don't really want a war with Russia  Their real goal is to put President Trump in a no win scenario If he declared war, they would call him reckless and start an effort to impeach him and if he refused to, they'd accuse him of collaborating with Putin and try to impeach him Democrats are willing to do real harm to the country if they think doing so will help them gain power Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 17 Jul 2018  President Donald Trump's refusal to rehash allegations of Kremlin-backed interference in the 2016 presidential election during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday incensed Democrat lawmakers and left wing media pundits. </p><p>Standing alongside Putin, President Trump steered clear of confrontation with the Russian, while questioning U.S. intelligence and last week's federal indictments of 12 Russians for hacking into Democratic email accounts to purportedly hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.'I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,' President Trump said following a two hour one-on-one meeting with his Russian counterpart.\u00a0'He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.' President Trump's remarks prompted an onslaught of calls for the U.S. to respond to Russia's alleged meddling, described as an 'act of war.' Leading up to the high stakes meeting between President Trump and Putin, CNN\u00a0New Day\u00a0host Chris Cuomo repeatedly accused[3] Russia of 'election hacking' to wage war against the U.S. 'The big, ugly white elephant in the room will be the U.S. election hacking,' Cuomo speculated. 'We've been calling it meddling, but I'm trying to stay away from the word because it's just way too mild. This is an act of war.' The CNN host described the Russian hacking allegations as 'the truth': 'How does [Donald Trump] raise the act of war of the hacking and different attacks during the U.S. election when Vladimir Putin knows damn well that President Trump doesn't really believe the truth and doesn't put a whole lot of stock in the event itself?' HuffPo's Mike Signorile published an opinion-editorial on Monday morning affirming Russia committed an 'act of war,' while accusing President Trump of refusing to discuss the allegations of meddling with the Russian President More[4] Time Cover Morphs Trump and Putin Together as President Accuses 'Fake News Media' of Wanting War With Russia[5] Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review July 19, 2018  Time magazine has merged the faces of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin together on its latest cover. New @TIME[6] pic.twitter.com/otBLAvx92v[7]   Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) July 19, 2018[8]; After the joint press conference at Helsinki, Trump received intense backlash over his comments that seemed to support[9] Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Time cover is one more example of news coverage questioning the president's actions. However, Trump is not staying quiet. He took to Twitter to express[10] his views and claimed that the media is trying to incite hostility toward Russia: The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!   Donald J.

The hearing's topic was 'China's threat to American government and private sector research and innovation leadership.' But after Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) gave his opening remarks, he turned the floor over to Schiff for his opening statement. Schiff began by attacking the Helsinki meeting and said he was concerned that Trump met with Putin alone without even his own national security adviser. Schiff then raised a motion to subpoena the interpreter who attended the meeting. Nunes said he would not entertain the motion since Schiff only could bring a motion to adjourn, and reminded Schiff he had the remainder of three minutes to make his opening statement. Schiff challenged Nunes, who then called a recess to discuss the matter. The hearing witnesses   four China experts   talked with staff and among themselves. After the recess, Nunes moved to table   or postpone   the motion, which Republicans voted for by voice vote. Schiff then requested a recorded vote. The motion was then tabled along party lines, 11-6. 'Schiff has decided to turn this hearing into a Russia clown show,' a house staffer said More[14] John McCain Just Responded to Controversial Helsinski Summit and It's as Intense as You'd Imagine[15] 'No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant'??? McCain's memory must be failing him His statement does not reflect reality, or even a reasoned opinion It is hateful slander and it is dangerous for the country when people of Senator McCain's prestige stoop self-indulgent viciousness at the expense of a sitting president Dave Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review July 16, 2018  McCain must have forgotten about this Dave John McCain held nothing back in a statement made shortly after the Helsinski press conference The senator expressed his concerns with Trump aligning himself too closely with Putin, citing his many alleged crimes. Here's his full statement:\u00a0 'Today's press conference in Helsinki\u00a0was one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. The\u00a0damage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate.\u00a0But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake. 'President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world. 'It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout   as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. But\u00a0these were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin's regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. 'Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic and erratic conduct\u00a0towards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today's press conference\u00a0marks a recent low point in the history of the American presidency. That\u00a0the president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisers makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable. 'No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are   a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed.\u00a0Americans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting totally in vain.' More[16] Tucker: Left doesn't believe in borders, citizenship[17].

Pictures of Donald Trump Dominate Google Image Search for 'Idiot'[18] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  In contrast to Google, this is what DuckDuckGo produced for the word 'Idiot' No pictures of Trump here, but it has Obama, Rachel Maddow, Babs Streisand Dave Searches for 'idiot' on Google Images return pictures of President Trump in the top five results, and heavily throughout the rest of the list. According to Business Insider[19], 'Anti-Trump activists are gaming Google's algorithm so that when people search for 'idiot,' almost all of the top results are pictures of Donald Trump.' President Trump was praising Google at the same time the search giant's results returned his picture when 'idiot' is searched for. I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S., but not for long!   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018[20] 'Protesters are publishing articles on their own platforms which associate the word 'idiot' with Trump, as well as sharing and upvoting articles which do the same,' they explained, adding that the 'net effect of this is that the association inside Google's algorithm becomes stronger, producing photos of Trump when people input the term.' When Breitbart News searched Google Images using the term, the results were predominantly pictures of President Trump. In May, Google was criticized[21] for listing 'Nazism' as an official ideology of the California Republican Party. Google blamed the incident on their reliance on Wikipedia, which can be edited by any user. Despite this, Google still relies heavily on Wikipedia and continues to artificially display results from the website at the top of nearly all searches More[22] Corrected Speech-Censored Speech-Ignored Speech[23] Two of the biggest highlights of the show  We pointed out how the FBI's investigation of the DNC data breachwhich has now been officially blamed on 12 Russiansnever followed obvious indications that the data breach was actually an inside jobcommitted by DNC staffer Seth Rich[24]who was mysteriously murdered and whose case remains unsolved I also got an opportunity to speak from personal experience on how the tech giants are repressing conservative speechThe entire Stand in the Gap Today audience now knowshow Freedom Update was blocked by Comcastand how we had to switch to a PDF attachment to circumvent the online censors Dave  Sam Rohrer, Gary Dull   Guest: Dave Bailey (Author, Education Consultant) Stand in the Gap Today July 18, 2018  Corrected Speech-Censored Speech-Ignored Speech.

The Turkish government blocks more than 100,000 sites, including Wikipedia. In Saudi Arabia, a range of news sites linked to rivals Qatar and Iran are off limits. 'My first thought was, 'Welcome to China,'' said a banker in Cairo, recalling his attempt to access Mada Masr, Egypt's leading independent news organization, which has been blocked since June 2017. He asked to have his name withheld for fear of government reprisal. In recent weeks, Egypt's Parliament has moved to cement online censorship in law, including legislation passed on Monday[27] that gives the government the right to block social-media users and accounts that engage in any of a number of vaguely-defined violations such as 'incitement to break the law.' Authoritarian governments in the Middle East are increasingly adopting a version of China's approach to online censorship, walling their citizens off from swaths of the internet and denying access to popular websites, often with the aid of Western technology. China has banned Facebook[28] since 2009, two years before social media played an instrumental role in the uprisings of the Arab Spring. As a result, surfing the internet is often a more limited experience than people in the West are used to. Cairo, for example, has more than doubled the number of websites it blocks to an estimated 500 in the past year, according to watchdog groups. And the internet can differ considerably from place to place, depending on the priorities of people in power. 'We're starting to head toward a model where each country has its own version of the internet,' said Alp Toker, the director of NetBlocks, a London-based organization that tracks online censorship around the world. Governments that see potential threats from the internet have long sought to spy on their citizens online, and Middle Eastern regimes have often cut off or slowed down the internet in times of stress. Egypt briefly shut down all internet access during the 2011 revolution[29] that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Turkey has blocked and slowed social media repeatedly, including during the crackdown that followed the failed 2016 coup attempt. But as advanced technologies become more widely available on the open market, even countries without a large domestic tech industry are becoming increasingly sophisticated in targeting internet usage. Those technologies include deep packet inspection, which allows authorities to block, monitor, redirect and alter internet traffic, experts say. According to Citizen Lab, an internet research group at the University of Toronto, Egypt is blocking websites with the help of devices whose digital fingerprint matches those of products sold by Sandvine, a firm based in Fremont, Calif., and Waterloo, Ontario.

Rep. Matt Gaetz: Peter Strzok's Text on Opening a 'Case' While McCabe Was FBI Director Related to Russia[36] Kristina Wong Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  FBI agent Peter Strzok's text to FBI lawyer Lisa Page hours after FBI Director James Comey was fired that said they needed to 'open the case we've been waiting on' now that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was in charge was related to the Trump-Russia investigation, according to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). 'That text message was not unrelated to Russia,' Gaetz said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday. The evening right after Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, Strzok had texted Page, his then-paramour, at 8:14 p.m. with: 'We need to open the case we've been waiting on now while Andy is acting.' Page responded the next morning at 4:57 a.m., with: 'We need to lock in [redacted]. In a formal, chargeable way. Soon.' Strzok confirmed during his testimony on Thursday that 'Andy' meant McCabe, but refused to confirm what 'case' he was referring to, or who Page was talking about. But Page, who testified behind closed doors on Friday and Monday was much more forthcoming about those texts, Gaetz said 'Strzok refused to answer what it was related to. And Lisa Page gave a testimony that was in direct conflict with what I understood to be Rosenstein's explanation.' Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) told Strzok during his open-testimony last week that if he and Page talked about opening an investigation based on who was then-FBI director, it would violate due process. 'Decisions about when and whether to open investigations and when and whether to charge people with crimes aren't supposed to depend on who's sitting in the director's chair, or on political decisions, or on the political agendas of FBI agents and lawyers,' he said last week at a House Judiciary and Oversight Government Reform Committees joint hearing. 'So if a Trump-hating FBI agent and a Trump-hating FBI lawyer who have talked about effing Trump, stopping Trump, impeaching Trump are, within hours of President Trump firing their boss, if they start talking about opening an investigation now that 'Andy is acting,' and that some person needs to be locked in in a 'formal, chargeable way, soon'   I know, as a former U.S. attorney whoever is the subject of that case that was opened now that Andy is acting   and whoever you and Ms. Page talked about needing to be locked in soon in a formal chargeable way   well, they would have had their civil liberties violated. They would have been deprived of due process.' At the time of those exchanges, Comey had just been fired, McCabe had become acting FBI director, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller had not yet been appointed Both Page and Strzok played key roles on both the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations. Page served as legal counsel to McCabe, and as his liaison to Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigation teams. She would then work on the special counsel team for two months before her assignment there ended. Strzok, led the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations, then served on the special counsel team until Mueller learned of the text messages Strzok and Page had sent. During those three phases, Strzok and Page exchanged at least 50,000 text messages to one another, many of which expressed animus towards Trump and a preference for Clinton. In one text, Strzok had told Page that they would 'stop' Trump's election More[37] Nunes: DOJ, FBI 'Banking' on Republicans to Lose in Midterms[38] Trent Baker Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  Wednesday, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on Fox News Channel's 'Hannity' to discuss the Department of Justice and FBI 'obstructing' the investigation into the 2016\u00a0election with the hope to get Democrats victories in the 2018 midterm elections. Nunes accused the DOJ and FBI of 'banking' on the Republicans to lose in the fall. 'It's the oldest trick in the book,' Nunes said. 'We are getting a very slow snail-pace cooperation that is clearly designed to wait until next week when Congress adjourns. Now, I have news for them. They are still going to have to come in and give depositions. They may think they are not going to, but they are going to be coming in and getting depositions throughout the summer.' He added, 'They would love to see Republicans lose. I hate to say that, but I have to believe that the Department of Justice and FBI, the people at leadership, they are banking on a loss by the Republicans in the fall.' The video[39] Groups Such As ISIS Cannot Be Allowed To Exist, Mattis Says[40] Low and behold, I happened to do a DuckDuckGo[41] (not Google!) search that turned up this important press release from the Department of Defense It was published over a month ago, and yet I never saw a report on it in any news media This demonstrates again that our news media are so busy expressing outrageat President Trump or in the case of Fox News and Breitbart, defending him from the rabid MSM that they are not doing their primary job of reporting important news to the public Dave Terri Moon Cronk U.S. Department of Defense June 8, 2018  WASHINGTON   While Iraq has liberated all of its territory once captured and held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, the U.S.-led military campaign against the rogue organization continues in Syria, Defense Secretary James N. Mattis said at a meeting of the defeat-ISIS coalition at\u00a0NATO[42] headquarters in Brussels today. Mattis attended a conference of the alliance's defense ministers this week. 'A little over 100 hours ago, our [Syrian] partner forces began the first of several offensives to diminish ISIS' physical caliphate,' the secretary said. 'As operations ultimately draw to a close, we must avoid leaving a vacuum in Syria that can be exploited by the [Syrian President Bashar Assad] regime or its supporters.' Despite the successes of the last year, the enduring defeat of ISIS is not over, Mattis said, noting that NATO approved a training mission yesterday and called it a step in the right direction. 'We look forward to working with the new government of Iraq on this as we assist a key partner in denying our common terrorist enemy any chance to recover,' he said. 'Every battlefield is also a humanitarian field, even after the fighting stops. To ensure a lasting defeat and prevent an ISIS 2.0 requires all elements of our collective national power,' the secretary said. 'Initiating and maintaining stabilization activities are essential, as citizens cannot return to normal life in communities cleared of explosives and debris, and those conditions that initially allowed ISIS to take root return.' While coalition members have contributed generously, short-term shortfalls remain, and continued support on an urgent basis will augment local security in liberated areas, Mattis said.  Foreign-Fighter Detainees  'Each of us also has an urgent responsibility to address the foreign-fighter detainee problem,' he added. 'We all must ensure captured terrorists remain off the battlefield and off our streets by taking custody of detainees from our countries or quickly coming up with suitable options.'  The United States faces the same problem and is working diligently to find a way to solve it, Mattis emphasized. 'Abrogating this responsibility is not an option, as it plants the seeds for the next round of violence against innocents,' he said. As the U.S.-led coalition has repeatedly demonstrated, its greatest weapon against the enemy and the coalition's greatest strength remains unity, he said. It is critical that the strong spirit of collaboration fostered by the 75-member coalition be preserved as the coalition transitions from combat to stabilization operations, so other locations do not suffer the consequences witnessed in Iraq, Syria, the Philippines and elsewhere, the secretary said More[43] U.S. Weighs Destinations for Islamic State Detainees in Syria[44] Some fighters have been returned to countries of origin, others could wind up at Guantanamo Bay The governments taking back their jihadists don't want their citizens to know about it They know it would be political suicide if the public understood how the dire effects of their blindness to Islam's threat are now coming home to roost literally Dave Gordon Lubold The Wall Street Journal July 18, 2018  WASHINGTON The U.S. has returned about two dozen suspected Islamic State fighters detained in Syria to their home countries as it grapples with the fate of hundreds more, leaving the door open to sending some to the American prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. defense officials said. The Pentagon has been assisting the Kurdish and Arab forces it backed in Syria in holding about 600 Islamic State detainees in seven detention facilities there, U.S. defense officials said. The Defense Department has paid to upgrade the facilities and improve conditions, but has left the job of guarding and monitoring detainees to its primary ally in Syria, an amalgam of Kurdish and Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, they said. There are about 400 more Syrian fighters also held separately by the SDF and thousands more Syrians, including women and children, who are also being held but not in the same facilities, U.S. officials said. The issue of what to do with the suspected fighters has been a thorny one for U.S. policy makers, who have sought to keep Washington's distance from the detention or prosecution of fighters captured on the battlefield. President Donald Trump's vow this year to remove American forces from Syria has accelerated efforts to find a way to solve the problem. The best solution thus far has been an attempt to resettle detainees is by repatriating them to their home countries, the defense officials said. So far, about two dozen suspected fighters have been returned to their countries of origin, and another 100 or so are in the process of being sent back to their countries, said John Rood, the Pentagon's top policy official, in an interview, confirming details not previously reported. Mr. Rood declined to provide specifics about what foreign capitals had accepted the detainees, citing those countries' desire not to publicize the deals More[45] A Tale of Two Killings[46] Chicago erupts in violence over a police shooting, but no outrage attends the far more typical killing of a bystander by a murderous felon.

Yes, this is a real graphic, from ItsGoingDown.org[49]; . which operates in allegiance with[50] Black Lives Matter . Isn't it strange that they aren't being censored, but we are? Dave Last Sunday, a 59-year-old woman on the West Side of Chicago was killed by a would-be carjacker. The felon walked up to the driver's side of the car, which was being driven by a 71-year-old man, and pulled his gun. The senior citizen refused to surrender the vehicle and kept driving. The would-be carjacker opened fire at the car, striking the woman in the head and killing her. The night before, on the South Side, a Chicago officer killed a 37-year-old man whom the officer's patrol partners had observed behaving in a manner suggesting that he was carrying a gun. The officers tried to question Harith Augustus, and he appeared to pull something from his wallet, according to police body-camera footage, possibly his firearms owner-identification card. One officer tried to grab Augustus (the police report said that he became combative), but he pulled away and ran into the street, where he appeared to reach for the gun holstered on his right hip. One of the officers opened fire and killed him. Augustus's gun was recovered at the scene. True to script, the officer-involved shooting sparked violent street anarchy on Saturday night, instigated by Black Lives Matter, the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and other anti-cop activist groups. Protesters threw rocks and bottles, some filled with urine, at officers. Four officers were injured. Chants included 'How do you spell racist? CPD [Chicago Police Department],' and 'Murderers.' Protests have continued, drawing intense local media and political attention. 'This department is racist . . . and we're tired of it,' said one of the organizers. There were no protests against the taking of the carjacking victim's life. Carjackings have nearly tripled in Chicago since 2015, averaging two per day in 2017 and close to that in 2018 In the first six months of 2018, more than 60 children under 15 have been shot in Chicago. In June alone, an 11-year-old boy was shot in the head; a 12-year-old girl was killed as she was carrying her baby cousin; and a 14-year-old boy was gunned down by a passing car.\u00a0Black Lives Matter activists have nothing to say about this violence because it does not involve police officers More[51] As upstart Ocasio-Cortez hits campaign trail with Bernie Sanders, high profile spurs fears of Dem rift[52] Another example of the red-green alliance, and its take-over of the Democratic Party Dave Gregg Re Fox News July 19, 2018 Comments made by New York Democratic primary winner draw criticism from Democrats; former aide to Senator Schumer Chris Hahn and political strategist Mark Penn react on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

No Corporations open divisions in other countries, which mostly employ local people and the employees who do cross the border do so legally (or at least they should) In order to make his case, Ellison has to manufacture falsehood after falsehood And yet this man is the Deputy Chair of the DNC[57]. No wonder the DNC is radicalizing and becoming incoherent Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 18 Jul 2018  During an interview with the editor-in-chief of Tikkun Magazine, Rabbi Michael Lerner , Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) said it was an 'injustice' that corporations are allowed to cross borders seeking low wage workers but workers are not allowed to cross the border seeking higher wages. Ellison said, 'An undocumented worker is an exploited worker. We just have to say the 12 million undocumented people in the United States are here because somebody wants them to be. They want them to do the work but they don't want them to have any rights, they don't want to pay them fairly, they don't want them to be able to bargain collectively, they don't want them to be able to get occupational safety and standards. And that is what is really going on. The trade agreements they allow capital to travel over borders and all capital is, is people who happen to own something we call a corporation which is a legal agreement that gives them special rights.' He continued, 'And labor, which is a regular person, cannot travel back and forth across the border. And so corporations, certain people who get certain rights, can go back and forth across the border seeking out the lowest wages, but people, regular people cannot go back and forth across the border seeking out the highest wages. So what it creates is an imbalance, it creates an injustice and it creates the need for something like a global Marshall Plan.' He added, 'Yes, we need to have fair trade rules. Yes we need to make sure we raise labor standards everywhere not reduce them, we need to raise environmental standards everywhere, not reduce them, but we also need to rebuild  the part of the world that so many of us rely on to get everything from cheap flowers, to cheap strawberries, to cheap this, to cheap that, we need to understand our interconnectedness globally.'

Tucker in a hearing Monday, prosecutors told The Philadelphia Inquirer. Judge tosses terror case convictions, orders prisoner freed[72] Associated Press July 19, 2018 ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A federal judge in Virginia called for the immediate release Thursday of a former Marine who was training with a Pakistani terrorist group shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria ordered several counts of Seifullah Chapman's conviction vacated and ordered the release of Chapman, who was serving a 65-year sentence. Chapman traveled to Pakistan before the Sept. 11 attacks to train with a group called Lashkar-e-Taiba. After 9/11, Chapman ended his training and returned to the U.S. In April, the Supreme Court struck down a law allowing deportation of some immigrants who commit crimes. The high court ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague about what crimes would prompt deportation. Four terrorism defendants, including Chapman, argued they were convicted under a law that was similarly vague about describing a 'crime of violence.' In April, Brinkema demanded the government show cause for why she shouldn't vacate the convictions obtained more than a decade ago against what prosecutors called a 'Virginia jihad network,' which used paintball games in the woods near Fredericksburg as a means of training for holy war. Several group members traveled to Pakistan after Sept. 11 with the goal of joining the Taliban in Afghanistan. At trial, several said they were persuaded to go when the group's spiritual leader, Ali Al-Timimi, said after Sept. 11 that the world was on the verge of an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and nonbelievers. Chapman admitted attending the Lashkar camp in August 2001 but said he did so not to train for holy war but for a grueling physical challenge in the rugged Pakistani mountains. Al-Timimi, of Falls Church, was convicted of soliciting treason, among other counts, and sentenced to life in prison. Masoud Khan, on the other hand, traveled to Pakistan after Sept. 11 to join Lashkar, which group members believed was the best way to get necessary training to join the Taliban. Khan is serving a life sentence. The fourth defendant affected by Brinkema's order, Ismail Royer, is already out of prison after serving more than a decade. He struck a plea deal in which he admitted helping some group members make contact with Lashkar. Royer said by phone Thursday that the development in Chapman's case makes him hopeful for his own. More[73] Air Force surrenders to demand to replace Bible with generic 'book of faith' on POW/MIA table[74] Todd Starnes Fox News July 19, 2018 The commander of F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has agreed to replace a Bible on a POW/MIA table with a generic 'book of faith,' the Military Religious Freedom Foundation[75] revealed this week. The MRFF is a militant organization that has fought against Nativity scenes, Bible studies and any outward expressions of the Christian faith on U.S. military installations. The head of the foundation, Mikey Weinstein, wrote in the HuffPost[76] that he is dedicated to fighting 'virulent religious oppression' carried out by 'incredibly well-funded gangs of fundamentalist Christian monsters who terrorize their fellow Americans by forcing their weaponized and twisted version of Christianity upon their helpless subordinates in our nation's armed forces.' The MRFF alleges that as many as 36 unnamed clients at the Air Force base in Wyoming have complained about the inclusion of the Bible on the table honoring prisoners of war and missing comrades. 'Our MRFF clients under Col. (Stacy) Huser's command remain resolute in their most fervent objection to this blatant display of fundamentalist Christian supremacy, domination and exceptionalism,' Weinstein wrote in a letter to the military. The Air Force base decided to temporarily rotate the Bible with books from other faiths until it could be permanently replaced with a 'book of faith,' the MRFF said on its website[77] Tuesday. Col. Huser confirmed the MRFF account. She said in a statement Thursday: 'One of our focus areas is increasing the sense of belonging for all our Airmen; a large part of that effort is ensuring the religious and non-religious feel included and cared for. This concern being brought to our attention only helps us work toward meeting the needs of all Airmen. The 90th Missile Wing is scheduled to replace the Bible on the POW/MIA table with a 'book of faith' containing spiritual writings and prayers from the five DoD (Department of Defense) Chaplain appointed faith groups and a sixth set of blank pages to represent those who find solace by other means.' The ceremonial remembrance table is a tradition that was started after the Vietnam War, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command Communication and Outreach Division. The table traditionally includes a Holy Bible to represent 'faith in a higher power and the pledge to our country, founded as one nation under God.' Weinstein's crusade to eradicate Bibles from POW/MIA tables is gaining traction.

Since President Donald Trump withdrew [80]the U.S. from the nuclear deal in May, Iran's manufacturers, Persian-rug exporters and shopkeepers have increasingly struggled to make transactions in dollars for imports of needed supplies. Foreign companies are winding down contracts and the threat of sanctions has scared away big foreign banks, many of which paid billions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators for sanctions violations in the past five years.  Even when Iranian companies can finance an import deal, the weakness of Iran's currency[81], the rial down 50% this year compared with the dollar has made imports so expensive in the local currency that they are cutting production and canceling contracts.  'The situation is severe,' said Georgik Daniali, an executive at Parsian High Voltage Substations Development Co., a Tehran company that imports parts for making electrical-grid infrastructure. He said his company is planning to lower output by 15% to 20% this year in anticipation of higher costs for imports  More[82] Hungary joins US in withdrawing from UN global migration agreement[83] Adam Shaw Fox News July 19, 2018 Hungary's populist government announced this week that it is withdrawing from a U.N. global compact on migration, describing the agreement as 'in conflict with common sense' and national security   making it the second country after the U.S. to reject the compact. 'The primary issue for us is the security of Hungary and the Hungarian people, and this document is totally at odds with the country's security interests,' Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 said[84] in Budapest on Wednesday. 'According to the Government's position, the U.N. Global Compact for Migration is in conflict with common sense and also with the intent to restore European security.' The agreement, officially called the 'Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,' was finalized Friday and was an effort to find an agreement that covered migration 'in a holistic and comprehensive manner.' 'Migration raises profound issues: around state sovereignty and human rights; around what constitutes voluntary movement; the relationship between development and mobility; and how to support social cohesion.' U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said Friday. 'This compact demonstrates the potential of multilateralism: our ability to come together on issues that demand global collaboration   however complicated and contentious they may be,' she added. The agreement is expected to be adopted by members states at an intergovernmental migration conference in Morocco in December. The U.S. pulled out of talks in December, with then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arguing that it could undermine America's right to enforce its immigration laws and secure its borders. 'The United States supports international cooperation on migration issues, but it is the primary responsibility of sovereign states to help ensure that migration is safe, orderly, and legal,' Tillerson said. Hungary's decision is unlikely to surprise many observers. As with President Trump, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz Party has made cracking down on mass migration a focus of its agenda, and comfortably won re-election in the country's national elections in April campaigning on that very issue More[85] Man who urged Prince George attack given life sentence[86] BBC News 13 July 2018  An Islamic State group supporter who called for an attack on Prince George has been jailed for life with a minimum of 25 years.

England Knife, Gun, Rape Attacks and Homicide Continue Rapid Rise[91] Liam Deacon Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  'High-harm' violent offences involving weapons are soaring in England and Wales, as a crime wave continues, with knife and gun crime, as well as homicide, shooting up. Meanwhile, police also recorded 31 percent more rapes, up to 53,977, and 21 percent more other sexual offences, rising to 96,755. The revelations, from the latest official figures[92] published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), show offences involving knives or sharp instruments rising by 16 percent to 40,147 - the fourth consecutive increase in knife attacks revealed by the ONS. The figures are police-recorded crimes for the year to March, and also show homicides rose 12 percent by 74 to 701 in the period, even with exceptional incidents with multiple victims such as the terror attacks in London and Manchester not included. Gun crime also rose, but at a less dramatic rate than knife crime, with a two\u00a0percent increase to 6,492 offences while the number of robberies soared by 30 percent to 77,103 in the 12-month period.

Dave Dems, Left Wing Media Claim Russian Hacking an 'Act of War'[2] Remember when Democrats used to be the party of peace-lovers? Remember how outraged they were at George W. Bush's Iraq war which they initially voted for? America has always been reluctant to declare war Throughout the entire Cold War, we never declared war on Russia though they did far worse than anything alleged today And yet Democrats and their media allies are making claims that, if taken seriously, would result in a declaration of war  As usual, the Democrats don't really want a war with Russia  Their real goal is to put President Trump in a no win scenario If he declared war, they would call him reckless and start an effort to impeach him and if he refused to, they'd accuse him of collaborating with Putin and try to impeach him Democrats are willing to do real harm to the country if they think doing so will help them gain power Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 17 Jul 2018  President Donald Trump's refusal to rehash allegations of Kremlin-backed interference in the 2016 presidential election during a joint press conference with Russian President Vladimir Putin Monday incensed Democrat lawmakers and left wing media pundits. </p><p>Standing alongside Putin, President Trump steered clear of confrontation with the Russian, while questioning U.S. intelligence and last week's federal indictments of 12 Russians for hacking into Democratic email accounts to purportedly hurt Hillary Clinton in 2016.'I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today,' President Trump said following a two hour one-on-one meeting with his Russian counterpart.'He just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be.' President Trump's remarks prompted an onslaught of calls for the U.S. to respond to Russia's alleged meddling, described as an 'act of war.' Leading up to the high stakes meeting between President Trump and Putin, CNNNew Dayhost Chris Cuomo repeatedly accused[3] Russia of 'election hacking' to wage war against the U.S. 'The big, ugly white elephant in the room will be the U.S. election hacking,' Cuomo speculated. 'We've been calling it meddling, but I'm trying to stay away from the word because it's just way too mild. This is an act of war.' The CNN host described the Russian hacking allegations as 'the truth': 'How does [Donald Trump] raise the act of war of the hacking and different attacks during the U.S. election when Vladimir Putin knows damn well that President Trump doesn't really believe the truth and doesn't put a whole lot of stock in the event itself?' HuffPo's Mike Signorile published an opinion-editorial on Monday morning affirming Russia committed an 'act of war,' while accusing President Trump of refusing to discuss the allegations of meddling with the Russian President More[4] Time Cover Morphs Trump and Putin Together as President Accuses 'Fake News Media' of Wanting War With Russia[5] Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review July 19, 2018  Time magazine has merged the faces of President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin together on its latest cover. New @TIME[6] pic.twitter.com/otBLAvx92v[7] \u2014 Michael Calderone (@mlcalderone) July 19, 2018[8]; After the joint press conference at Helsinki, Trump received intense backlash over his comments that seemed to support[9] Putin's denials of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The Time cover is one more example of news coverage questioning the president's actions. However, Trump is not staying quiet. He took to Twitter to express[10] his views and claimed that the media is trying to incite hostility toward Russia: The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 19, 2018[11] More[12] Schiff Hijacks China Hearing, Tries to Subpoena Trump-Putin Meeting Interpreter[13] Kristina Wong Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  House Intelligence Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA) raised a motion to subpoena the interpreter who attended President Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Finland, during a hearing on Thursday. The hearing's topic was 'China's threat to American government and private sector research and innovation leadership.' But after Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) gave his opening remarks, he turned the floor over to Schiff for his opening statement. Schiff began by attacking the Helsinki meeting and said he was concerned that Trump met with Putin alone without even his own national security adviser. Schiff then raised a motion to subpoena the interpreter who attended the meeting. Nunes said he would not entertain the motion since Schiff only could bring a motion to adjourn, and reminded Schiff he had the remainder of three minutes to make his opening statement. Schiff challenged Nunes, who then called a recess to discuss the matter. The hearing witnesses \u2014 four China experts \u2014 talked with staff and among themselves. After the recess, Nunes moved to table \u2014 or postpone \u2014 the motion, which Republicans voted for by voice vote. Schiff then requested a recorded vote. The motion was then tabled along party lines, 11-6. 'Schiff has decided to turn this hearing into a Russia clown show,' a house staffer said More[14] John McCain Just Responded to Controversial Helsinski Summit and It's as Intense as You'd Imagine[15] 'No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant'??? McCain's memory must be failing him His statement does not reflect reality, or even a reasoned opinion It is hateful slander and it is dangerous for the country when people of Senator McCain's prestige stoop self-indulgent viciousness at the expense of a sitting president Dave Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review July 16, 2018  McCain must have forgotten about this Dave John McCain held nothing back in a statement made shortly after the Helsinski press conference The senator expressed his concerns with Trump aligning himself too closely with Putin, citing his many alleged crimes. Here's his full statement: 'Today's press conference in Helsinkiwas one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory. Thedamage inflicted by President Trump's naivete, egotism, false equivalence, and sympathy for autocrats is difficult to calculate.But it is clear that the summit in Helsinki was a tragic mistake. 'President Trump proved not only unable, but unwilling to stand up to Putin. He and Putin seemed to be speaking from the same script as the president made a conscious choice to defend a tyrant against the fair questions of a free press, and to grant Putin an uncontested platform to spew propaganda and lies to the world. 'It is tempting to describe the press conference as a pathetic rout \u2014 as an illustration of the perils of under-preparation and inexperience. Butthese were not the errant tweets of a novice politician. These were the deliberate choices of a president who seems determined to realize his delusions of a warm relationship with Putin's regime without any regard for the true nature of his rule, his violent disregard for the sovereignty of his neighbors, his complicity in the slaughter of the Syrian people, his violation of international treaties, and his assault on democratic institutions throughout the world. 'Coming close on the heels of President Trump's bombastic and erratic conducttowards our closest friends and allies in Brussels and Britain, today's press conferencemarks a recent low point in the history of the American presidency. Thatthe president was attended in Helsinki by a team of competent and patriotic advisers makes his blunders and capitulations all the more painful and inexplicable. 'No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant. Not only did President Trump fail to speak the truth about an adversary; but speaking for America to the world, our president failed to defend all that makes us who we are \u2014 a republic of free people dedicated to the cause of liberty at home and abroad. American presidents must be the champions of that cause if it is to succeed.Americans are waiting and hoping for President Trump to embrace that sacred responsibility. One can only hope they are not waiting totally in vain.' More[16] Tucker: Left doesn't believe in borders, citizenship[17]. It's surreal to watch Democratic politicians in California encourage foreign nationals to vote in our elections. Our offices won't be far behind, and the trend is growing. The Left rejects the notion that America is even a country. It's an idea, they often tell us. Pictures of Donald Trump Dominate Google Image Search for 'Idiot'[18] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  In contrast to Google, this is what DuckDuckGo produced for the word 'Idiot' No pictures of Trump here, but it has Obama, Rachel Maddow, ...bs Streisand Dave Searches for 'idiot' on Google Images return pictures of President Trump in the top five results, and heavily throughout the rest of the list. According to Business Insider[19], 'Anti-Trump activists are gaming Google's algorithm so that when people search for 'idiot,' almost all of the top results are pictures of Donald Trump.' President Trump was praising Google at the same time the search giant's results returned his picture when 'idiot' is searched for. I told you so!

When Breitbart News searched Google Images using the term, the results were predominantly pictures of President Trump. In May, Google was criticized[21] for listing 'Nazism' as an official ideology of the California Republican Party.

The Turkish government blocks more than 100,000 sites, including Wikipedia. In Saudi Arabia, a range of news sites linked to rivals Qatar and Iran are off limits. 'My first thought was, 'Welcome to China,'' said a banker in Cairo, recalling his attempt to access Mada Masr, Egypt's leading independent news organization, which has been blocked since June 2017. He asked to have his name withheld for fear of government reprisal. In recent weeks, Egypt's Parliament has moved to cement online censorship in law, including legislation passed on Monday[27] that gives the government the right to block social-media users and accounts that engage in any of a number of vaguely-defined violations such as 'incitement to break the law.' Authoritarian governments in the Middle East are increasingly adopting a version of China's approach to online censorship, walling their citizens off from swaths of the internet and denying access to popular websites, often with the aid of Western technology. China has banned Facebook[28] since 2009, two years before social media played an instrumental role in the uprisings of the Arab Spring. As a result, surfing the internet is often a more limited experience than people in the West are used to. Cairo, for example, has more than doubled the number of websites it blocks to an estimated 500 in the past year, according to watchdog groups. And the internet can differ considerably from place to place, depending on the priorities of people in power. 'We're starting to head toward a model where each country has its own version of the internet,' said Alp Toker, the director of NetBlocks, a London-based organization that tracks online censorship around the world. Governments that see potential threats from the internet have long sought to spy on their citizens online, and Middle Eastern regimes have often cut off or slowed down the internet in times of stress. Egypt briefly shut down all internet access during the 2011 revolution[29] that ousted former President Hosni Mubarak. Turkey has blocked and slowed social media repeatedly, including during the crackdown that followed the failed 2016 coup attempt. But as advanced technologies become more widely available on the open market, even countries without a large domestic tech industry are becoming increasingly sophisticated in targeting internet usage. Those technologies include deep packet inspection, which allows authorities to block, monitor, redirect and alter internet traffic, experts say. According to Citizen Lab, an internet research group at the University of Toronto, Egypt is blocking websites with the help of devices whose digital fingerprint matches those of products sold by Sandvine, a firm based in Fremont, Calif., and Waterloo, Ontario. The company is one of the world's largest providers of network management tools and a supplier to telecom giants such as Comcast[30] Corp  More[31] This is more than just another method for weeding out conservatives It is Orwellian a modernized version of the scene in 1984[32] where the interrogator asks Wilson'How many fingers am I holding up?'

Rep. Matt Gaetz: Peter Strzok's Text on Opening a 'Case' While McCabe Was FBI Director Related to Russia[36] Kristina Wong Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  FBI agent Peter Strzok's text to FBI lawyer Lisa Page hours after FBI Director James Comey was fired that said they needed to 'open the case we've been waiting on' now that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe was in charge was related to the Trump-Russia investigation, according to Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL). 'That text message was not unrelated to Russia,' Gaetz said in an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Tuesday. The evening right after Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, Strzok had texted Page, his then-paramour, at 8:14 p.m. with: 'We need to open the case we've been waiting on now while Andy is acting.' Page responded the next morning at 4:57 a.m., with: 'We need to lock in [redacted]. In a formal, chargeable way. Soon.' Strzok confirmed during his testimony on Thursday that 'Andy' meant McCabe, but refused to confirm what 'case' he was referring to, or who Page was talking about. But Page, who testified behind closed doors on Friday and Monday was much more forthcoming about those texts, Gaetz said 'Strzok refused to answer what it was related to. And Lisa Page gave a testimony that was in direct conflict with what I understood to be Rosenstein's explanation.' Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) told Strzok during his open-testimony last week that if he and Page talked about opening an investigation based on who was then-FBI director, it would violate due process. 'Decisions about when and whether to open investigations and when and whether to charge people with crimes aren't supposed to depend on who's sitting in the director's chair, or on political decisions, or on the political agendas of FBI agents and lawyers,' he said last week at a House Judiciary and Oversight ...vernment Reform Committees joint hearing. 'So if a Trump-hating FBI agent and a Trump-hating FBI lawyer who have talked about effing Trump, stopping Trump, impeaching Trump are, within hours of President Trump firing their boss, if they start talking about opening an investigation now that 'Andy is acting,' and that some person needs to be locked in in a 'formal, chargeable way, soon' \u2014 I know, as a former U.S. attorney whoever is the subject of that case that was opened now that Andy is acting \u2014 and whoever you and Ms. Page talked about needing to be locked in soon in a formal chargeable way \u2014 well, they would have had their civil liberties violated. They would have been deprived of due process.' At the time of those exchanges, Comey had just been fired, McCabe had become acting FBI director, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller had not yet been appointed Both Page and Strzok played key roles on both the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations. Page served as legal counsel to McCabe, and as his liaison to Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigation teams. She would then work on the special counsel team for two months before her assignment there ended. Strzok, led the Clinton email and Trump-Russia investigations, then served on the special counsel team until Mueller learned of the text messages Strzok and Page had sent. During those three phases, Strzok and Page exchanged at least 50,000 text messages to one another, many of which expressed animus towards Trump and a preference for Clinton. In one text, Strzok had told Page that they would 'stop' Trump's election More[37] Nunes: DOJ, FBI 'Banking' on Republicans to Lose in Midterms[38] Trent Baker Breitbart News 19 Jul 2018  Wednesday, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) appeared on Fox News Channel's 'Hannity' to discuss the Department of Justice and FBI 'obstructing' the investigation into the 2016election with the hope to get Democrats victories in the 2018 midterm elections. Nunes accused the DOJ and FBI of 'banking' on the Republicans to lose in the fall. 'It's the oldest trick in the book,' Nunes said. 'We are getting a very slow snail-pace cooperation that is clearly designed to wait until next week when Congress adjourns. Now, I have news for them. They are still going to have to come in and give depositions. They may think they are not going to, but they are going to be coming in and getting depositions throughout the summer.' He added, 'They would love to see Republicans lose. I hate to say that, but I have to believe that the Department of Justice and FBI, the people at leadership, they are banking on a loss by the Republicans in the fall.'

Mattis said at a meeting of the defeat-ISIS coalition atNATO[42] headquarters in Brussels today. Mattis attended a conference of the alliance's defense ministers this week. 'A little over 100 hours ago, our [Syrian] partner forces began the first of several offensives to diminish ISIS' physical caliphate,' the secretary said. 'As operations ultimately draw to a close, we must avoid leaving a vacuum in Syria that can be exploited by the [Syrian President Bashar Assad] regime or its supporters.' Despite the successes of the last year, the enduring defeat of ISIS is not over, Mattis said, noting that NATO approved a training mission yesterday and called it a step in the right direction. 'We look forward to working with the new government of Iraq on this as we assist a key partner in denying our common terrorist enemy any chance to recover,' he said. 'Every battlefield is also a humanitarian field, even after the fighting stops. To ensure a lasting defeat and prevent an ISIS 2.0 requires all elements of our collective national power,' the secretary said. 'Initiating and maintaining stabilization activities are essential, as citizens cannot return to normal life in communities cleared of explosives and debris, and those conditions that initially allowed ISIS to take root return.' While coalition members have contributed generously, short-term shortfalls remain, and continued support on an urgent basis will augment local security in liberated areas, Mattis said.  Foreign-Fighter Detainees  'Each of us also has an urgent responsibility to address the foreign-fighter detainee problem,' he added. 'We all must ensure captured terrorists remain off the battlefield and off our streets by taking custody of detainees from our countries or quickly coming up with suitable options.'  The United States faces the same problem and is working diligently to find a way to solve it, Mattis emphasized. 'Abrogating this responsibility is not an option, as it plants the seeds for the next round of violence against innocents,' he said. As the U.S.-led coalition has repeatedly demonstrated, its greatest weapon against the enemy and the coalition's greatest strength remains unity, he said. It is critical that the strong spirit of collaboration fostered by the 75-member coalition be preserved as the coalition transitions from combat to stabilization operations, so other locations do not suffer the consequences witnessed in Iraq, Syria, the Philippines and elsewhere, the secretary said More[43] U.S. Weighs Destinations for Islamic State Detainees in Syria[44] Some fighters have been returned to countries of origin, others could wind up at Guantanamo Bay The governments taking back their jihadists don't want their citizens to know about it They know it would be political suicide if the public understood how the dire effects of their blindness to Islam's threat are now coming home to roost literally Dave Gordon Lubold The Wall Street Journal July 18, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014The U.S. has returned about two dozen suspected Islamic State fighters detained in Syria to their home countries as it grapples with the fate of hundreds more, leaving the door open to sending some to the American prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, U.S. defense officials said. The Pentagon has been assisting the Kurdish and Arab forces it backed in Syria in holding about 600 Islamic State detainees in seven detention facilities there, U.S. defense officials said. The Defense Department has paid to upgrade the facilities and improve conditions, but has left the job of guarding and monitoring detainees to its primary ally in Syria, an amalgam of Kurdish and Arab fighters known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, they said. There are about 400 more Syrian fighters also held separately by the SDF and thousands more Syrians, including women and children, who are also being held but not in the same facilities, U.S. officials said. The issue of what to do with the suspected fighters has been a thorny one for U.S. policy makers, who have sought to keep Washington's distance from the detention or prosecution of fighters captured on the battlefield. President Donald Trump's vow this year to remove American forces from Syria has accelerated efforts to find a way to solve the problem. The best solution thus far has been an attempt to resettle detainees is by repatriating them to their home countries, the defense officials said. So far, about two dozen suspected fighters have been returned to their countries of origin, and another 100 or so are in the process of being sent back to their countries, said John Rood, the Pentagon's top policy official, in an interview, confirming details not previously reported. Mr. Rood declined to provide specifics about what foreign capitals had accepted the detainees, citing those countries' desire not to publicize the deals More[45] A Tale of Two Killings[46] Chicago erupts in violence over a police shooting, but no outrage attends the far more typical killing of a bystander by a murderous felon.

Yes, this is a real graphic, from ItsGoingDown.org[49]; . which operates in allegiance with[50] Black Lives Matter . Isn't it strange that they aren't being censored, but we are? Dave Last Sunday, a 59-year-old woman on the West Side of Chicago was killed by a would-be carjacker. The felon walked up to the driver's side of the car, which was being driven by a 71-year-old man, and pulled his gun. The senior citizen refused to surrender the vehicle and kept driving. The would-be carjacker opened fire at the car, striking the woman in the head and killing her. The night before, on the South Side, a Chicago officer killed a 37-year-old man whom the officer's patrol partners had observed behaving in a manner suggesting that he was carrying a gun. The officers tried to question Harith Augustus, and he appeared to pull something from his wallet, according to police body-camera footage, possibly his firearms owner-identification card. One officer tried to grab Augustus (the police report said that he became combative), but he pulled away and ran into the street, where he appeared to reach for the gun holstered on his right hip. One of the officers opened fire and killed him. Augustus's gun was recovered at the scene. True to script, the officer-involved shooting sparked violent street anarchy on Saturday night, instigated by Black Lives Matter, the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, and other anti-cop activist groups. Protesters threw rocks and bottles, some filled with urine, at officers. Four officers were injured. Chants included 'How do you spell racist? CPD [Chicago Police Department],' and 'Murderers.' Protests have continued, drawing intense local media and political attention. 'This department is racist . . . and we're tired of it,' said one of the organizers. There were no protests against the taking of the carjacking victim's life. Carjackings have nearly tripled in Chicago since 2015, averaging two per day in 2017 and close to that in 2018 In the first six months of 2018, more than 60 children under 15 have been shot in Chicago. In June alone, an 11-year-old boy was shot in the head; a 12-year-old girl was killed as she was carrying her baby cousin; and a 14-year-old boy was gunned down by a passing car.Black Lives Matter activists have nothing to say about this violence because it does not involve police officers More[51] As upstart Ocasio-Cortez hits campaign trail with Bernie Sanders, high profile spurs fears of Dem rift[52] Another example of the red-green alliance, and its take-over of the Democratic Party Dave Gregg Re Fox News July 19, 2018 Comments made by New York Democratic primary winner draw criticism from Democrats; former aide to Senator Schumer Chris Hahn and political strategist Mark Penn react on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

No Corporations open divisions in other countries, which mostly employ local people and the employees who do cross the border do so legally (or at least they should) In order to make his case, Ellison has to manufacture falsehood after falsehood And yet this man is the Deputy Chair of the DNC[57]. No wonder the DNC is radicalizing and becoming incoherent Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 18 Jul 2018  During an interview with the editor-in-chief of Tikkun Magazine, Rabbi Michael Lerner\u200f, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) said it was an 'injustice' that corporations are allowed to cross borders seeking low wage workers but workers are not allowed to cross the border seeking higher wages. Ellison said, 'An undocumented worker is an exploited worker. We just have to say the 12 million undocumented people in the United States are here because somebody wants them to be. They want them to do the work but they don't want them to have any rights, they don't want to pay them fairly, they don't want them to be able to bargain collectively, they don't want them to be able to get occupational safety and standards. And that is what is really going on. The trade agreements they allow capital to travel over borders and all capital is, is people who happen to own something we call a corporation which is a legal agreement that gives them special rights.' He continued, 'And labor, which is a regular person, cannot travel back and forth across the border. And so corporations, certain people who get certain rights, can go back and forth across the border seeking out the lowest wages, but people, regular people cannot go back and forth across the border seeking out the highest wages. So what it creates is an imbalance, it creates an injustice and it creates the need for something like a global Marshall Plan.' He added, 'Yes, we need to have fair trade rules. Yes we need to make sure we raise labor standards everywhere not reduce them, we need to raise environmental standards everywhere, not reduce them, but we also need to rebuild \u200ethe part of the world that so many of us rely on to get everything from cheap flowers, to cheap strawberries, to cheap this, to cheap that, we need to understand our interconnectedness globally.'

Judge tosses terror case convictions, orders prisoner freed[72] Associated Press July 19, 2018 ALEXANDRIA, Va. - A federal judge in Virginia called for the immediate release Thursday of a former Marine who was training with a Pakistani terrorist group shortly before the Sept. 11 attacks occurred. U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria ordered several counts of Seifullah Chapman's conviction vacated and ordered the release of Chapman, who was serving a 65-year sentence. Chapman traveled to Pakistan before the Sept. 11 attacks to train with a group called Lashkar-e-Taiba. After 9/11, Chapman ended his training and returned to the U.S. In April, the Supreme Court struck down a law allowing deportation of some immigrants who commit crimes. The high court ruled the law was unconstitutionally vague about what crimes would prompt deportation. Four terrorism defendants, including Chapman, argued they were convicted under a law that was similarly vague about describing a 'crime of violence.' In April, Brinkema demanded the government show cause for why she shouldn't vacate the convictions obtained more than a decade ago against what prosecutors called a 'Virginia jihad network,' which used paintball games in the woods near Fredericksburg as a means of training for holy war. Several group members traveled to Pakistan after Sept. 11 with the goal of joining the Taliban in Afghanistan. At trial, several said they were persuaded to go when the group's spiritual leader, Ali Al-Timimi, said after Sept. 11 that the world was on the verge of an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and nonbelievers. Chapman admitted attending the Lashkar camp in August 2001 but said he did so not to train for holy war but for a grueling physical challenge in the rugged Pakistani mountains. Al-Timimi, of Falls Church, was convicted of soliciting treason, among other counts, and sentenced to life in prison. Masoud Khan, on the other hand, traveled to Pakistan after Sept. 11 to join Lashkar, which group members believed was the best way to get necessary training to join the Taliban. Khan is serving a life sentence. The fourth defendant affected by Brinkema's order, Ismail Royer, is already out of prison after serving more than a decade. He struck a plea deal in which he admitted helping some group members make contact with Lashkar. Royer said by phone Thursday that the development in Chapman's case makes him hopeful for his own. More[73] Air Force surrenders to demand to replace Bible with generic 'book of faith' on POW/MIA table[74] Todd Starnes Fox News July 19, 2018 The commander of F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming has agreed to replace a Bible on a POW/MIA table with a generic 'book of faith,' the Military Religious Freedom Foundation[75] revealed this week. The MRFF is a militant organization that has fought against Nativity scenes, Bible studies and any outward expressions of the Christian faith on U.S. military installations. The head of the foundation, Mikey Weinstein, wrote in the HuffPost[76] that he is dedicated to fighting 'virulent religious oppression' carried out by 'incredibly well-funded gangs of fundamentalist Christian monsters who terrorize their fellow Americans by forcing their weaponized and twisted version of Christianity upon their helpless subordinates in our nation's armed forces.' The MRFF alleges that as many as 36 unnamed clients at the Air Force base in Wyoming have complained about the inclusion of the Bible on the table honoring prisoners of war and missing comrades. 'Our MRFF clients under Col. (Stacy) Huser's command remain resolute in their most fervent objection to this blatant display of fundamentalist Christian supremacy, domination and exceptionalism,' Weinstein wrote in a letter to the military. The Air Force base decided to temporarily rotate the Bible with books from other faiths until it could be permanently replaced with a 'book of faith,' the MRFF said on its website[77] Tuesday. Col. Huser confirmed the MRFF account. She said in a statement Thursday: 'One of our focus areas is increasing the sense of belonging for all our Airmen; a large part of that effort is ensuring the religious and non-religious feel included and cared for. This concern being brought to our attention only helps us work toward meeting the needs of all Airmen. The 90th Missile Wing is scheduled to replace the Bible on the POW/MIA table with a 'book of faith' containing spiritual writings and prayers from the five DoD (Department of Defense) Chaplain appointed faith groups and a sixth set of blank pages to represent those who find solace by other means.' The ceremonial remembrance table is a tradition that was started after the Vietnam War, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command Communication and Outreach Division. The table traditionally includes a Holy Bible to represent 'faith in a higher power and the pledge to our country, founded as one nation under God.' Weinstein's crusade to eradicate Bibles from POW/MIA tables is gaining traction.

Since President Donald Trump withdrew [80]the U.S. from the nuclear deal in May, Iran's manufacturers, Persian-rug exporters and shopkeepers have increasingly struggled to make transactions in dollars for imports of needed supplies. Foreign companies are winding down contracts and the threat of sanctions has scared away big foreign banks, many of which paid billions of dollars in fines to U.S. regulators for sanctions violations in the past five years.  Even when Iranian companies can finance an import deal, the weakness of Iran's currency[81], the rial\u2014down 50% this year compared with the dollar\u2014has made imports so expensive in the local currency that they are cutting production and canceling contracts.

'The primary issue for us is the security of Hungary and the Hungarian people, and this document is totally at odds with the country's security interests,' Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjrt\u00f3 said[84] in Budapest on Wednesday. 'According to the Government's position, the U.N. Global Compact for Migration is in conflict with common sense and also with the intent to restore European security.' The agreement, officially called the 'Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,' was finalized Friday and was an effort to find an agreement that covered migration 'in a holistic and comprehensive manner.' 'Migration raises profound issues: around state sovereignty and human rights; around what constitutes voluntary movement; the relationship between development and mobility; and how to support social cohesion.' U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said Friday. 'This compact demonstrates the potential of multilateralism: our ability to come together on issues that demand global collaboration \u2014 however complicated and contentious they may be,' she added. The agreement is expected to be adopted by members states at an intergovernmental migration conference in Morocco in December. The U.S. pulled out of talks in December, with then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arguing that it could undermine America's right to enforce its immigration laws and secure its borders.

Dave Reuters Sep 24, 2018  U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election, has verbally resigned in anticipation of being fired by President Donald Trump, Axios news site reported. Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, the report said, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter. A second source told Axios that Rosenstein is 'expecting to be fired' so he plans to step down. There was widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein after a New York Times report on Friday said in 2017 he had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment[2] to remove him from the office. </p><p>The Times said none of those proposals came to fruition. Rosenstein denied the report as 'inaccurate and factually incorrect.' MSBNC and CNN reported Rosenstein was summoned for a meeting at the White House on Monday. Rosenstein assumed the role in the Russia investigation after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself after his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public More[3] White House: Rod Rosenstein Not Fired, Will Meet with President Trump on Thursday[4] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The White House clarified that President Donald Trump did not fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday, despite reports that he had offered his resignation. 'Because the president is at the United Nations General Assembly and has a full schedule with leaders from around the world, they will meet on Thursday when the president returns to Washington, DC,' White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders wrote in astatement on Twitter.[5] Statement on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: pic.twitter.com/yBgAydv9oR[6] \u2014 Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) September 24, 2018[7] Several news outlets reported[8] that Rosenstein had verbally offered his resignation to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly after the New York Times[9] reported Friday he discussed wearing a wire to record the president as well as using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Sanders said that Rosenstein spoke with the president about the news stories, but it is likely that Trump will wait until Thursday to announce his decision. Rosenstein traveled to the White House on Monday,according[10] to reports,[11] but was there to attend a previously scheduled meeting More[12] Nikki Haley Quashes 'Absurd' Rumors that Cabinet Was Plotting To Impeach Trump[13] Here's the latest 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' questionbeing used to undermine President Trump's authority Dave Madison Dibble Sep 24, 2018  Many rumorshave been circulatingabout a potential plan to impeach President Donald Trump from inside his own cabinet, but Nikki Haley[14] is setting the record[15] straight. The latest prediction of Trump's demise includesreports[16]that some members of the cabinet were considering invoking the 25th Amendment[17] to remove the president from office. The 25th Amendment states: 'Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.' In other words, members of Trump's cabinet could join Vice President Mike Penceto pen a letter to leaders in the House and Senate that states that the president is incapable of doing his job. In response, the president can argue that the alleged incapability doesn't exist and Congress will decide with a two-thirds vote to reinstate the president. But if United Nations Ambassador Haley is telling the truth, the details of the 25th Amendment don't matter because no cabinet member is considering that extreme option. ABC News' George Stephanopolous asked the U.N. Ambassador if she has ever been a part of discussions about impeaching the president. Watch: .@GStephanopoulos[18]: 'Have you ever been part of any discussion on perusing the 25th Amendment as a member of the cabinet?' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley: 'I have never been part of it, I've never heard it that's absurd' <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/27WaWwocZV\">https://t.co/27WaWwocZV</url>[19] #ThisWeek[20] pic.twitter.com/TZEAO2QejE[21] \u2014 This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 23, 2018[22]; 'I've never been part of [impeachment talks]. I've never heard it. I don't think that's a reality at all among all the cabinet members. I've just never heard it. It's absurd,' said Ambassador Haley More[23] The Rebellion at Justice[24]: Don't fire Rosentein, but do release the 2016 FBI-Justice documents. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  Donald Trump keeps saying that the November election is a referendum on him, so a key part of the Democratic strategy is feeding the narrative of chaos in the White House: Trump-baiting so he'll overreact. That's probably the best way to look at the New York Times story on Friday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein contemplated wearing a wire at the White House and removing the President via the 25th Amendment.  Mr. Trump is so far avoiding the advice that he instantly fire Mr. Rosenstein, and rightly so. The alleged comments were made in spring 2017 and it isn't clear how much is true. The story is based on an account by Andrew McCabe about a meeting among Justice officials in May 2017. Mr. McCabe was part of the Jim Comey FBI tong that wants to elect a Democratic Congress and impeach Mr. Trump.  Mr. Rosenstein says he 'never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.' The idea of using the 25th Amendment to remove a President who isn't physically incapacitated is so dumb that only pundits looking for attention would propose it.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer immediately warned Mr. Trump not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, which in today's Washington means that he wants Mr. Trump to fire him. Then he'll have another media conflagration his candidates can ride to retake Congress. Mr. Rosenstein was no doubt feeling beleaguered in May 2017, and a day after the alleged meeting he appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But Mr. Trump was partly responsible for that mess.  Mr. Rosenstein had written an excellent memo explaining why Mr. Comey deserved to be fired as FBI director. But Mr. Trump, taking the anti-Trump media bait, told NBC that the real reason he fired Mr. Comey was because he refused to say publicly that he wasn't investigating Mr. Trump. Then the President tweeted falsely that there may be tapes of Mr. Comey's White House meetings. Mr. Comey leaked his own memos, and a political uproar left Mr. Rosenstein feeling used.  That was 16 months ago. Mr. Mueller has since brought many indictments against former Trump associates but he hasn't provided a sliver of evidence about the Russia-Trump collusion narrative that was supposed to justify the investigation. The immediate battle now is over the midterm election and whether Mr. Trump can stay in office as the impeachment assault begins from Nancy Pelosi's Democrats. Mr. Trump can make personnel changes after the midterms if Republicans still hold the Senate and he can get someone confirmed.  Meanwhile on Friday, President Trump walked back his earlier decision to declassify a host of documents related to the Justice Department and FBI investigations during the 2016 election campaign. This is an odd decision and looks like a mistake. 'I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies' called to ask not to release,' Mr. Trump tweeted Friday. But releasing documents to the public isn't a coverup. It's an act of transparency. Mr. Trump needs to declassify the documents because the FBI and Justice have consistently stonewalled Congress. Releasing documents at this stage can't hurt the Mueller probe. As for the allies, sometimes U.S. democratic accountability has to take precedence over the potential embarrassment of British intelligence.  Releasing the documents would let Americans see for themselves how the FBI and Justice Department justified their decision to start their counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign and seek a warrant to spy on Carter Page; and whether or how they vetted the notorious Steele dossier. The unredacted emails and texts of Jim Comey's FBI team might also reveal political motivation.  Mr. Trump has agreed to let the Justice Department Inspector General review the documents 'on an expedited basis,' but time is of the essence. If Democrats take the House, they will shut down any attempt to scrutinize the actions of the FBI and Justice in 2016 More[25] Schumer made good on his pledgeThere is no deed too dastardly for him and his lackeys Flashback: Chuck Schumer Pledged to 'Oppose Kavanaugh with Everything I Have'[26]. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promised he would launch an aggressive anti-Brett Kavanaugh campaign, saying he would oppose 'Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything' he has, which he stated the same day in July that President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh Defies 'Grotesque Character Assassination' from the Left[27] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh responded to the latest allegations of sexual misconduct on Monday by denouncing them as smears. 'These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse,' he wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination \u2014 if allowed to succeed \u2014 will dissuade competent and good people from service.' Kavanuagh's letter expressed frustration with his delayed confirmation vote despite repeating his willingness to testify about the accusations from Christine Ford and a second 'uncorroborated' report in the New Yorker. He also remained defiant against the recent attacks against his character and his family. 'I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,' he wrote. 'The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.' President Donald Trump stood by Kavanaugh on Monday, telling reporters[28] in New York City that he backed his nominee to the Supreme Court 'all the way.' 'In my opinion, it is totally political,' he said, calling the allegations 'one of the single-most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything.' Kavanaugh Claims Give Vulnerable Democrats in Senate Cover to Oppose Him[29] Aside from being a delay tacticthese ridiculous last-minute charges against Kavanaughserve another important purpose Democrats holding offices in districts that voted for Trumpcan now claim to vote against Kavanaugh because of the sexual allegationsrather than because of opposition to his conservative views Dave Reuters Sep 18, 2018  The sexual-misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may remove pressure that some Democratic senators faced to back his confirmation as a way of reassuring conservative voters in congressional elections just seven weeks away. Since Kavanaugh was nominated[30] to the high court by President Donald Trump, Democratic senators from states that Trump won in 2016 were locked in a dilemma. If they didn't vote in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation, they would have appeared to be out of step with voters at home and risked losing re-election. Vote for him, and they would hand the president a bipartisan victory. The allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted a woman[31] while in high school, however, now gives those endangered Democrats an escape hatch[32]. They can oppose the nominee without appearing to voters as if they are defying the president, strategists said. Kavanaugh has denied the assault allegation, calling it 'completely false.' 'For those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh. Period. End of story,' said Jim Manley, a former high-ranking Democratic Senate aide. 'They have all the cover they need.' More[33] Ronan Farrow's New Yorker Piece Debunks Ramirez Allegation Against Kavanaugh[34] At this point, the treacherous deeds of the Democratslook like acts of desperation Not only do Dems not have a positive messagethey feel that they have to invent lies and destroy conservativesjust to seem relevant Dave John Nolte Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer are under fire for publishing a second allegation of sexual misconduct[35] against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. When you look at how thin the story is, that criticism might be valid. But Farrow and Mayer deserve credit for writing the full story \u2014 a story that not only appears to debunk Deborah Ramirez's allegation but exposes how the institutional left aggressively works behind the scenes to destroy Kavanaugh with spurious accusations. After 35 years of not being sure it was him, Ramirez now alleges that during a drunken dorm party during her and Kavanaugh's freshman year at Yale in 1983, he exposed himself to her in such an aggressive way she ended up accidentally touching his genitals. Obviously, this is a sensational allegation, and the timing is more than a little suspicious. The story appeared on Sunday night just as Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh began to unravel. Just a few hours earlier, the last of Ford's three witnesses, including a lifelong friend, had not only said (under penalty of imprisonment) they do not recall any misconduct on Kavanaugh's part, they do not even recall attending the 1982 house party where[36] the misconduct supposedly occurred. If anything, though, Ramirez's story is even less credible. Like Ford, neither of Ramirez's witnesses recall the party or the alleged incident, nor does her best friend. What's more, until Ramirez spent six days with her Democrat lawyer, she was unable to identify Kavanaugh as the man who exposed himself. Because of Ramirez's memory problems (she was also quite drunk at the alleged party) and her supposed witnesses stating none of this ever happened, some argue the New Yorker was irresponsible to publish. In fact, the New York Times found the story so lacking in credibility, the paper chose not to publish. But were it not for the New Yorker, we would not have learned how Democrats are willing to manipulate events behind the scenes in their ongoing effort to destroy Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations from more than 30 years ago. The New Yorker informs us: 'In her initial conversations withThe New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaughhad exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.' In other words, a full 35 years after the incident occurred, Ramirez (who the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat) could not put the finger on Kavanaugh as the alleged flasher. Moreover, we learn 'Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening' and that at the party she 'became inebriated' and 'was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words.' Nevertheless, after all this time, over the past few days, she became sure it was Kavanaugh thanks to 'carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.' Thanks to the New Yorker's in-depth reporting, however, we know exactly who the attorney is who helped Ramirez recall her memory \u2014 'Stanley Garnett, a former Democratic district attorney' from Boulder,Colorado.

Cupp Calls out the 'Very Obvious Double Standard' When It Comes to Kavanaugh, Ellison Allegations[38] Carlin Becker Sep 23, 2018  CNN's S.E. Cupp hosted a panel on her 'Unfiltered' on Saturday to discuss the sexual assault allegations lobbed at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Rep.Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and pointed out the 'very obvious double standard' in the room.  She started right off by putting Democrats on blast for supporting[39] Ellison in the wake of the allegations while meanwhile declaring Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford must be believed[40]: 'Keith Ellison, Democratic Congressman from Minnesota, Deputy Chair of the DNC, running for Attorney General in Minnesota, has been accused by two women of domestic violence.Not only aren't Democrats insisting that they be believed and he step aside, he easily won his democratic primary, but at least one of his accusers has said her own party, the democratic party, has smeared and isolated her.' Next, Cupp played a clip fromFriday night's debate[41] among Minnesota attorney general candidates, during which Ellison questioned his accusers and said he couldn't predict what someone 'might cook up' about him in the future. 'How can democrats explain a very obvious double standard in outrage?' Cupp asked. 'The issue of looking into allegations of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment need to be done apolitically, and that's really a standard we can't ever veer off of.'

'Every senator that does not try to delay the confirmation hearing is an accomplice and is casting a vote of approval for the subjugation of women's bodies - our exploitation through rape,'warned one female protester while occupying Senator Ben Sasse's (R-NE) office. 'I know there are many women in this room, not just me, who have been drunk as teenagers and have been exploited and can't remember the details - because that's how life works If Sasse, if he does not try to stop this [he] is an accomplice and for the rest of his career will be held accountable by people like me who have many years of voting ahead of us.'

Avenatti rose to national prominence representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her quest to break free of a non-disclosure agreement with President Donald Trump; he now purports to represent a third individual accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. In an email to Mike Davis, Chief Counsel for Nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee, Avenatti called on the panel to ask Kavanaugh about the meaning of a caption reading 'FFFFFFFourth of July'\u2014 a code, the lawyer claims, means 'Find'em, French them, Feel them, Finger them, F*ck them, Forget'em.' 'We have reason to believe' that salacious interpretation, Avenatti wrote. 'We request that Mr. Kavanaugh provide an answer as why these entries were made and what they stand for.' Avenatti, whose antics have earned him the nickname 'Creepy Porn Lawyer,'[62] also demanded senators look into Kavanaugh's use of the term 'Devil's Triangle,' which he asserts is a reference to a threesome.

Professor Eun-Jeong Han of Salisbury University began her upper-level Communications course on Wednesday by displaying PowerPoint slides describing what it means to have white privilege. A student in the class took pictures to document portions of the presentation. The presentation slide reads: Being White means rarely or never having to think about it. Three major characteristics of Whites in the U.S.1) White privilege2) A standpoint from which White people view themselves, others, and society The professor's third point about 'being white' was not captured in the image. Another slide titled '50 White privileges' showed an image of a caucasian female with the words 'we're privileged, people see us, not a color' scrawled across her face. Professor Han told Breitbart News the PowerPoint slides were from the textbook assigned in the syllabus, and that the in-class assignment was meant to 'make students think about the privilege that they rarely think about.' More[67] Why the Left Is Consumed With Hate[68]: Lacking worthy menaces to fight, it is driven to find a replacement for racism. Failing this, what is left? Shelby Steele The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  Even before President Trump's election, hatred had begun to emerge on the American left\u2014counterintuitively, as an assertion of guilelessness and moral superiority. At the Women's March in Washington the weekend after Mr. Trump's inauguration, the pop star Madonna said, 'I have thought an awful lot of blowing up the White House.' Here hatred was a vanity, a braggadocio meant to signal her innocence of the sort of evil that, in her mind, the White House represented. (She later said the comment was 'taken wildly out of context.') For many on the left a hateful anti-Americanism has become a self-congratulatory lifestyle. 'America was never that great,' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently said. For radical groups like Black Lives Matter, hatred of America is a theme of identity, a display of racial pride.  For other leftists, hate is a license. Conservative speakers can be shouted down, even assaulted, on university campuses. Republican officials can be harassed in restaurants, in the street, in front of their homes. Certain leaders of the left\u2014Rep. Maxine Waters comes to mind\u2014are self-appointed practitioners of hate, urging their followers to think of hatred as power itself. How did the American left\u2014conceived to bring more compassion and justice to the world\u2014become so given to hate? It began in the 1960s, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings. That acceptance changed America forever. It imposed a new moral imperative: America would have to show itself redeemed of these immoralities in order to stand as a legitimate democracy.  The genius of the left in the '60s was simply to perceive the new moral imperative, and then to identify itself with it. Thus the labor of redeeming the nation from its immoral past would fall on the left. This is how the left put itself in charge of America's moral legitimacy. The left, not the right\u2014not conservatism\u2014would set the terms of this legitimacy and deliver America from shame to decency. This bestowed enormous political and cultural power on the American left, and led to the greatest array of government-sponsored social programs in history\u2014at an expense, by some estimates, of more than $22 trillion. But for the left to wield this power, there had to be a great menace to fight against\u2014a tenacious menace that kept America uncertain of its legitimacy, afraid for its good name. This amounted to a formula for power: The greater the menace to the nation's moral legitimacy, the more power redounded to the left. And the '60s handed the left a laundry list of menaces to be defeated. If racism was necessarily at the top of the list, it was quickly followed by a litany of bigotries ending in 'ism' and 'phobia.' Today's left lacks worthy menaces to fight. It is driven to find a replacement for racism, some sweeping historical wrongdoing that morally empowers those who oppose it. (Climate change?) Failing this, only hatred is left. Hatred is a transformative power. It can make the innocuous into the menacing. So it has become a weapon of choice. The left has used hate to transform President Trump into a symbol of the new racism, not a flawed president but a systemic evil. And he must be opposed as one opposes racism, with a scorched-earth absolutism More[69] DOJ Staffer Caught on Deep State Tape Sting 'No Longer Works for' Department[70] Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018 Washington, D.C. - Allison Hrabar, the career paralegal caught on a Project Veritas video sting on the 'Deep State' that was released last week, is no longer with the Department of Justice, a DOJ source confirmed to Breitbart News.

Hrabar was featured prominently in the second video Project Veritas' James O'Keefe released investigating the 'Deep State': 'After the release of the video, there was a near-immediate push by top conservatives including[71] Americans for Limited Government to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to remove Hrabar from the Department of Justice.' The Department of Justice announced[72] after the video came out that it was investigating Hrabar's behavior: DEVELOPING: Statement from DOJ on today's vid: 'These allegations are deeply concerning. Department policy prohibits misuse of government resources to advance personal interests. We are looking into this immediately and have referred this matter to the Inspector General as well.' pic.twitter.com/cb6x1g8tu6[73] \u2014 James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) September 19, 2018[74]; Now, she is-per Department officials-no longer with the DOJ. The circumstances of how her employment was terminated, and exactly what happened internally at the Dept. since late last week, are unclear. In addition to having been a paralegal at DOJ, Hrabar is a top official at the Democratic Socialists of America's Washington, D.C., chapter. Therein lies the rub as to what she was caught doing in the Project Veritas video: She was seen using official government resources for Democratic Socialists of America purposes. One particularly notable incident in which Hrabar was involved[75] as a socialist activist was protesting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen back in the mid-summer when she was eating a restaurant.

Google Publishes Article Instructing Congress on How to Regulate Them[78] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Google published a document recently that outlines how the tech titan wants Congress to regulate them ahead of a Senate hearing this week. The document[79], titled 'Framework for Responsible Data Protection Regulation,' outlines how tech companies such as Google should be regulated and has been published shortly before Google's upcoming Senate hearing on consumer data privacy set for this Wednesday. The intro to the Google document states: 'In our digital era, a growing array of organizations use personal data to provide a growing range of services. Responsible data use can unlock benefits for people, companies, and other organizations around the world. Regulation can protect individuals and communities from harm and misuse of data, and help maintain the trust that enables innovation and change. Building on our efforts to provide innovative services that rely on personal data, and on our experience with evolving international privacy laws, we have synthesized the following set of high-level principles. These principles are based on established privacy regimes and are meant to apply to organizations that make decisions regarding the collection and use of personal information. This framework helps Google evaluate legal proposals and advocate for smart, interoperable, and adaptable data protection regulations' Jason Kint, the CEO of trade association Digital Content Next, toldAdweek that he believes Google's sudden release of this document was an attempt to go on the offensive ahead of Wednesdays hearing. 'The industry needs to take a hard look at Google's data collection and usage practices, particularly those happening passively, out of context, when the user has no idea they are even interacting with Google,' Kint said. 'Google dominates nearly every dimension of digital media, recognizing most users in their daily activities, and I think you'll find this framework only accelerates its dominance.' Google may have reason to be worried about the issue of regulation and attempt to influence the sort of regulation that they receive, especially given recent reports of an executive order recently drafted[80] that would see companies like Google investigated for antitrust violations. The executive order is reportedly[81] just awaiting President Trump's signature before the investigation can take place. The order is still only a draft and has yet to be reviewed by other government agencies according to White House officials More[82] Progressives Urge Business to Block Trump's Merit-Immigration Reform[83] This is what truly deserves to be called 'corporate welfare'Entire industries have risen up around our Welfare systemand to companies in those industries that receive money from Welfare recipientsthe more people on Welfare, the better Dave Neil Munro Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Progressives and lobbyists are urging business groups to block President Donald Trump's 'public charge' merit-reform of the nation's immigration laws. The reform allocates green cards to foreigners who less likely to need taxpayers' aid because they are skilled, healthy, or young. The reform likely saves many billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on the welfare, healthcare,and retirement costs of unskilled, unhealthy or old migrants. That reform is a big economic gain[84] for ordinary Americans, but also a big economic loss for business because every dollar spent on needy legal (or illegal) immigrants is also a hidden subsidy for business, including landlords, hospitals, groceries, and Wall Street. 'Some of the harms ...nsequences of the radical 'public charge' rule proposed by DHS [are] 'reduced revenues for healthcare providers participating in Medicaid' 'reduced revenues for grocery retailers participating in SNAP [in effect, nearly all grocery stores],' said Tweets[85] from Shawn Fremstad, a pro-migration leader at two progressive advocacy groups. Fremstad is a 'senior associate' at the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a 'senior fellow' at the Center for American Progress. He his Tweeted claim by displaying quotes from the 477-page draft regulation[86] released Sept. 22. He argued that the reform would also ensure: 'increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for by an insurer or patient' 'reduced revenues for agricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for purchase using SNAP' 'reduced revenues for landlords participating in federally funded housing programs' 'new direct ...direct costs' on 'immigration lawyers, immigration advocacy groups, health care providers of all types, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and religious organizations' The Department of Homeland Security regulation says it will impact roughly 382,000 foreign people per year who want to become legal immigrants. The regulation sketches possible savings of perhaps $10 billion per year while spotlighting losses for business More[87] Sen. Gillibrand Continues to Advocate for ICE to Be Abolished: 'Get Rid' of Them[88] Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review Sep 24, 2018  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is continuing to call for the abolition of ICE. During a town hall meeting in New York, Gillibrand gave her opinion on ICE. 'I couldn't be more against what this administration is doing, and I think what we can do is just keep speaking out, keep demanding something different,' She has been very outspoken[89] about issues she has with the agency, claiming that it has become[90] a 'deportation' agency.

'The reason why we should get rid of ICE, reimagine it and build something that works, is because it doesn't work,' said Gillibrand. 'What they're doing right now is unconscionable, and I think they should be able to fund the anti-terrorism stuff. But the enforcement removal operations are doing a terrible job, and we should reimagine it, and actually have a real immigration system that works.' However, ICE has been focusing their efforts on arresting illegal immigrants[96] with criminal backgrounds and has deported hundreds of people who had prior convictions. Last year, ICE officials[97] stated that they made 127,000 arrests that had a positive impact on drug and child predator crime The video and more[98] Poll: Plurality of Latinos 'Less Likely to Vote' for Candidates Who Want to Abolish ICE[99] Liberals don't seem to realize that many Latinos in the U.Scame here to get away from the crime in their home countries The last thing they want is for criminal elements to cross freely into our country Dave Tony Lee Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  A plurality of Latino voters are 'less likely to vote' for a candidate in the 2018 midterm elections who supports abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll. The poll[100], released on Sunday, found that 36% of Hispanic voters said they are 'less likely to vote' for a candidate who 'favors abolishing ICE' while 33% said they are 'more likely to vote.' Another 26% said there is 'no difference' and 5% said they were 'not sure.' After Democratic-Socialist candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a primary against a longtime incumbent Democrat on a platform that included abolishing ICE, Democrats like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) jumped on board and called for ICE to be abolished. But an August Associated Press/NORC poll [101]revealed how unpopular 'abolishing ICE' is, as the poll found that just 25% of Democrats and 25% of Americans want ICE to be abolished More[102] At U.N., Trump Will Face an Iran Gap With European Allies[103]  This week will be the first General Assembly gathering since President Trump quit the Iran nuclear accord  Farnaz Fassihi and Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  President Trump and his European counterparts square off at the United Nations this week on key policy issues dividing old allies: the fate of the Iran nuclear agreement and how to constrain the Islamic Republic's regional ambitions. The week of marathon diplomacy in New York will be the first time that heads of states of the U.S., European nations and Iran gather at the General Assembly since Mr. Trump quit the 2015 Iran nuclear accord[104] in May and will put U.S.-European divisions on global display. Mr. Trump and top officials plan to use the U.N. forum\u2014including a speech by Mr. Trump on Tuesday to world leaders, a Security Council session he is chairing and a series of meetings\u2014to denounce Iran, and mobilize international support for isolating the country through crippling sanctions. A key component of their complaint[105] will be Iran's meddling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and its continued financial and military support of militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. But the Europeans plan to counter the U.S. position that the nuclear agreement has failed and that new sanctions must be imposed. European countries have tried to help Iran navigate the sanctions[106], including on banking transactions, by creating economic incentives so Iran stays committed to the deal, though their ability to maintain economic ties with Tehran is limited and the continent's companies are rapidly pulling out. Iran, for its part, will attempt to widen the gap between the U.S. and Europe by portraying itself as abiding by its commitments while the U.S. disregards international accords. British, French and German diplomats plan to meet Monday with counterparts from Iran and other parties to the accord\u2014Russia and China\u2014to try to persuade Tehran to stick with the agreement as U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports take hold in November and foreign companies continue to depart[107].  Most Western businesses appear to be heeding Washington's warnings it will punish those found violating its economywide sanctions campaign. The risk of losing access to the world's largest economy and most important financial markets isn't worth keeping ties to a country whose gross domestic product is dwarfed by the U.S. Companies such as Boeing[108] Co. and German industrial firm Wintershall have either pulled out completely or said they are planning an exit. Ahead of Nov. 4, when some of the strongest sanctions kick in, Iran crude imports have fallen over the last four months in many of Tehran's biggest customers, analysts say. The remaining parties to the 2015 accord are expected to issue a statement in support of the deal after the meeting. The sharply differing views will put Washington and Europe on opposing courses on the world stage. 'Talking about Iran, talking about their proxies and the other things they are doing to destabilize the Middle East will certainly be a topic,' U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Thursday in a preview of the administration's priorities More[109] Russia and Iran, Military Allies, Are Fast Becoming Economic Rivals[110] Nations' partnership in Syria is giving way to a competition that is exacerbating Tehran's economic troubles One of the great side benefits of President Trump's sanctions on Iranis that it aggravates the rivalries already existing between it and Russia Russia and Iran are long-time historical rivalsand Russia would gladly eat away at a weakened Iranparticularly regarding disputed oil rights in the Caspian Sea Dave Sune Engel Rasmussen and Benoit Faucon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  President Trump's sanctions on Iran are working brilliantlyThere is only one thing that could screw it up Dave A military alliance between Russia and Iran [111]to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is giving way to an economic rivalry as Syria's war winds down, a contest Moscow is leading. The friction is adding pressure on Tehran as U.S. sanctions [112]squeeze Iran's economy. Russia's ascendancy also illustrates the muscular role it is playing in the Middle East through oil diplomacy and strategic economic ties. Russia also has increased arms and commercial trade with Iran's regional arch rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and continues to tussle with Iran over rights to natural resources in the Caspian Sea. In Syria, Russia is outdoing Iran for lucrative opportunities to rebuild the shattered country, even as the two continue to cooperate on the battlefield.  Russian oil production has soared in recent months as Iran's exports have fallen, drawing criticism from Iranian officials that Moscow is taking advantage of Tehran's vulnerability. 'Iran is in an unenviable position,' said Mark N. Katz, professor at George Mason University and expert in Russian relations in the Middle East. 'And Moscow is taking advantage of the situation.' Iran's trouble rose in May when President Trump pulled the U.S. out of a multinational deal intended to curb Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits and later announced new economic sanctions. That shocked Iran's already fragile economy[113]. The strategy has crippled oil exports, prompting the currency to plummet and inflation and unemployment to soar. The dire economy prompted Parliament to force President Hassan Rouhani to dismiss cabinet members. A second round of U.S. sanctions is set to begin on Nov. 4. The fastest-emerging front in the Iranian-Russian rivalry is oil. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh withdrew plans to attend a meeting on Sunday of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of teaming up to push for higher oil output to push down prices and hurt Iran's economy.  Since the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal, Iranian exports of oil and a light petroleum called condensate have collapsed.Officials at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. expect crude shipments to drop to about 1.5 million barrels a day this month, down by a third from June, say people familiar with the country's ports loading program. Russia, meanwhile, has increased its oil output by 250,000 barrels to 11.6 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. In August, Russia's oil and gas revenue rose nearly 50% from the same period last year, to about $83 billion. Most of the additional Russian oil is going to buyers that have reduced purchases of Iran oil for fear of running afoul of U.S. sanctions, such as Greece, Italy and Turkey, according to official data, shipping trackers and company officials More[114] Iran Warns US, Israel of Revenge After Parade Attack[115] Reuters Sep 24, 2018  Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the attackers who killed 25 people at a military parade were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would 'severely punish' those behind the bloodshed. The deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israeli of involvement in the attack and he said they should expect a devastating response from Tehran. In the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of Saturday's assault, many chanting 'Death to Israel and America'. Twelve members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were among the 25 dead. The coffins, wrapped in the flag of the Islamic Republic, were carried by the mourners. Many held pictures of a four-year-old boy killed in the incident, one of the worst such attacks against Iran's the most powerful military force. Four assailants fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq. 'Based on reports, this cowardly act was done by people who the Americanscome to help when they are trapped in Syria and Iraq, and are paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,' Khamenei said on his official website. Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami, in a speech broadcast on state TV, said: 'You have seen our revenge before. You will see that our response will be crushing and devastating and you will regret what you have done.' Tasnim new agency also quoted Salami as saying that the 'horrific crime' exposed the dark side of an alliance that the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel had created to counter Iranian influence in the region. The secretary of Iran's National Security Council said Tehran needed to talk to its neighbors to avoid tensions. 'It's essential to be fully aware and increase our constructive dialogues to neutralize the plots of enemies who want to create suspicion and disagreement among regional countries,' Ali Shamkhani said. He also criticized the United States, saying U.S. sanctions against Iran were illegal and that President Donald Trump was using them as a tool for 'personal revenge'. ANTAGONIZE The United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia and Washington, rejected Iran's allegations alluding to its involvement in the violence. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked by a Fox News interviewer if the United States played any role in the attack, said: 'When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake.' The loss of innocent lives was tragic, Pompeo added. There has been no reaction yet from Saudi Arabia or Israel. Accusations against Gulf countries will almost certainly antagonize Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia. The oil super-powers are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon.

Regardless of this forecast's accuracythis it underscores how important it is to move the country to EVs and plug-ins These care are very reliable, and a slew of new models are becoming availableMake your next car and EV or plug-in Dave Christopher Alessi The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  ALGIERS\u2014U.S. shale oil production will peak by the late 2020s, triggering renewed demand for OPEC crude after an expected decline and stagnation, the oil cartel said Sunday. In its latest forecast on the global oil landscape, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it expects U.S. shale growth to 'slow significantly' after 2023, before peaking at 14.3 million barrels a day between 2027 and 2028. Output should then fall to an average of 12.1 million barrels a day by 2040, according to OPEC. The use of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. to drill for oil in shale rock\u2014known as fracking\u2014has dramatically reshaped[118] the face of the global oil industry over the past decade, rivaling OPEC for market share. Shale was largely behind a glut of American oil that flooded the market over four years ago, leading oil prices to fall to $30 a barrel from more than a $100 a barrel in late 2014. In 2018, U.S. shale production is growing faster than it did during the boom years of 2011 to 2014, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.[119] The IEA has forecast that U.S. shale oil production will plateau in the late 2020s, while total non-OPEC production should decline. OPEC projects that 'the strongest annual increases are seen in the near-term, in which total U.S. tight oil increases by an average of 1.4 million barrels a day' annually from this year to 2020. The world's appetite for OPEC crude, meanwhile, should fall to 31.6 million barrels a day in 2023, compared with 32.6 million barrels a day in 2017, before again rising to current levels when U.S. shale supply peaks, the cartel said. 'Thereafter, a gradual decline in non-OPEC liquids supply, coupled with moderate, but sustained global demand growth, leads to a steady increase in demand for OPEC crude, which rises to nearly 40 million barrels a day by 2040,' the OPEC report noted More[120] As Migrants Turn to Spain, a Welcome Mat Shows Signs of Wear[121]  Political winds shift in country sheltered from rise of anti-immigrant parties across Europe  Jeannette Neumann The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  MADRID\u2014One of Pedro Snchez's first acts when he became Spain's prime minister in June was to provide safe harbor to a ship carrying 600 migrants[122] rescued from the Mediterranean, after it was refused entry by Italy's anti-immigration government. Two months later, when 116 migrants breached the border fence at a Spanish enclave in Africa, Mr. Snchez returned them to Morocco the next day. Spain has become Europe's main entry point[123] for migrants this year, overtaking Greece and Italy, and raising the stakes for Mr. Snchez and other leaders who want to maintain the country's position as one of Europe's most immigration-friendly countries. More than 34,000 seaborne migrants have landed on Spain's shores so far this year, a threefold increase from last year. Italy and Greece have each received about 20,000 arrivals so far this year. Despite a sharp fall in migration to Italy, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has kept up anti-immigration statements[124]. Spain wants the world to know it isn't Italy. 'We defend a migration policy that's respectful of human rights,' Mr. Snchez said last week. Pro-immigration activists said the speedy repatriations in August from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta were illegal because the migrants had no time to register and process asylum claims. Mr. Snchez said a bilateral agreement allowed him to send them straight back to Morocco. The new leader's different responses to the rescue vessel and border breach show him trying to support Spaniards' generally pro-immigration views while avoiding a backlash from those concerned about maintaining a secure border. Spaniards are among the Europeans most likely to consider immigration an opportunity for their country rather than a problem, according to a European Union survey in April. Most Spaniards think their country's integration of immigrants has been successful, the survey found. At the same time, tensions are visible at the local level. In Barcelona, the far-left mayor faces pressure from locals to control irregular immigrant street vendors Fermn Villar, head of a Barcelona business association, said the vendors create unfair competition for local retailers because they don't pay rent or taxes. Immigrants 'can come, we have to help them, but [city officials] aren't demanding anything in return,' Mr. Villar said. 'Immigrants have all the same rights but also the same obligations.' Spanish conservatives, now in opposition, are less critical of immigration than many right-leaning politicians elsewhere in Europe. But supporters of Spain's current approach to immigration are growing concerned that the increase in migration could sow the seeds of something Spanish democracy has never seen: a far-right nativist movement Amid the influx, Spain's conservative Popular Party has sought to sharpen its conservative credentials[125] on immigration and other issues, in part to combat a new center-right rival, Ciudadanos. With its harder tone, the Popular Party is also seeking to steal the thunder of the anti-immigrant message of the country's only far-right party, the tiny Vox More[126] Pope Francis: Virgin Mary Stands by the 'Deported'[127] The Pope is just making stuff up when he says that'Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Old Catholics, Muslims, Jewslived together in peace until the arrival of totalitarian ideologies' Any true historian can easily verify that the Pope is dead wrongThe easiest places to expose his lie are in the historiesof the Byzantine[128] and Ottoman[129] empires  Is the Pope really this ignorant?Or is he spreading propaganda and hoping that we are the ignorant ones? Dave Thomas D. Williams, PhD. Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Pope Francis has continued pushing his pro-immigration message in his trip to the Baltic states, urging his hearers to 'receive' the stranger even when he threatens our security and well-being. The Virgin Mary 'stands near those who suffer, those from whom the world flees, including those who have been put on trial, condemned by all, deported,' the pope said[130] during his homily Monday at the Shrine of the Mother of God in Latvia. 'Nor is it that they are simply oppressed or exploited; they are completely 'outside the system', on the very fringes of society,' Francis said. 'The Mother also stands close by them, steadfast beneath their cross of incomprehension and suffering.' In this Latvia leg of his three-nation visit to the Baltic states, Pope Francis denounced isolationism just as several European nations have begun to insist more on national sovereignty and the right to secure borders. The pope condemned 'ways of thinking that would have us be suspicious of others,' even when statistics show that 'we would be better off, more prosperous and more secure just by ourselves.' At those times, he said, 'Mary and the disciples of these lands invite us to 'receive' our brothers and sisters, to care for them, in a spirit of universal fraternity.' Earlier in his trip, the pope praised[131] Lithuanians for their history of accepting and integrating immigrants, suggesting that they have an important lesson to impart to their European brothers and sisters. Throughout its history, 'Lithuania was able to shelter, receive and accept peoples of various ethnic groups and religions,' Francis said in an address to Lithuanian authorities Saturday. 'All found a place to live in this land - Lithuanians, Tartars, Poles, Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Germans.' 'Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Old Catholics, Muslims, Jews - lived together in peace until the arrival of totalitarian ideologies that, by sowing violence and lack of trust, undermined its ability to accept and harmonize differences,' he said More[132] Vatican Cardinal: Pope Francis Is 'Ice-Cold, Cunning Machiavellian'[133] Thomas D. Williams, PhD Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The German progressive weeklyDer Spiegel has ended its love affair with the pope, declaring that the Church's sex abuse crisis is 'increasingly about Pope Francis.' In a stunning cover article[134] titled 'The Silence of the Shepherds,' the magazine blasts the pope for his unwillingness to answer direct questions regarding what he knew about the serial homosexual abuse by U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and when he knew it. An August 25 report[135] from a high-ranking Vatican official declared that the pope was aware of McCarrick's misdeeds at least as early as 2013\u2014since the official personally informed him\u2014and yet lifted sanctions against McCarrick that Pope Benedict had imposed and employed him as a consultant in naming new American bishops. Yet when journalists asked[136] the pope whether these allegations were true, and when indeed he had learned the facts about McCarrick, the pope neither confirmed nor denied the report, preferring instead the strategy of 'no comment.' According to Der Spiegel, Francis, who started as a 'brilliant reformer,' now threatens to squander his legacy because 'he often speaks at inopportune moments, yet in important moments remains silent.' More[137] Chicago Catholic Priest Who Burned Rainbow Flag Removed from Parish[138] This priest was absolutely right in doing what he didHe exposed the sexual culture that the LGBT community fosters within the Church Dave Katherine Rodriguez Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  A Chicago Catholic priest who burned an LGBTQ rainbow flag in defiance of a cardinal's orders has been removed from his parish as of Friday Chicago Cardinal BlaseCupich allegedly sent two of his deputies to inform Rev. Paul Kalchik on Friday that the archdiocese would be removing him from his pastoral duties after Kalchik burned the rainbow flag adorned with a cross in a closed-door ceremony, the Chicago Sun-Times reported[139]. The Archdiocese of Chicago also released a letter saying Kalchik would take time off 'to receive pastoral support.' 'It has become clear to me that Fr. Kalchik must take time away from the parish to receive pastoral support so his needs can be assessed,' Cupich wrote in a letter released by the archdiocese. A spokesperson for the archdiocese claimed 'this decision has been in motion for some time and is not directly due to the flag-burning.' The Chicago cardinal warned Rev. Paul Kalchik\u2014a priest at Resurrection Parish in the Avondale section of Chicago\u2014not to burn the flag, but Kalchik said he ignored the cardinal's warning and performed[140] a closed-door 'exorcism ceremony' where he burned the flag with seven parishioners in a fire pit. The flag had been featured behind the church's altar in the past, but parishioners said it had not been displayed for years. The 56-year-old priest announced in a church bulletin released September 2 that he planned to torch the flag after discovering it in storage. News of the flag-burning spread, prompting[141] LGBTQ activists to stage protests outside the church on Wednesday, calling Kalchik's actions a 'hate crime.' The North Side priest said he performed the ceremony because he felt the Chicago archdiocese was not adequately handling the sex abuse scandals or addressing the issue of homosexuality in the church More[142] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: Rosenstein's Departure; Nikki Haley on Impeachment Rumors; More[143] appeared first on Western Free Press[144].

Dave Reuters Sep 24, 2018  U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 presidential election, has verbally resigned in anticipation of being fired by President Donald Trump, Axios news site reported. Rosenstein, the No. 2 Justice Department official, verbally resigned to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, the report said, citing an unidentified source with knowledge of the matter. A second source told Axios that Rosenstein is 'expecting to be fired' so he plans to step down. There was widespread speculation that Trump would fire Rosenstein after a New York Times report on Friday said in 2017 he had suggested secretly recording Trump and recruiting Cabinet members to invoke a constitutional amendment[2] to remove him from the office. </p><p>The Times said none of those proposals came to fruition. Rosenstein denied the report as 'inaccurate and factually incorrect.' MSBNC and CNN reported Rosenstein was summoned for a meeting at the White House on Monday. Rosenstein assumed the role in the Russia investigation after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself after his own contacts with Russia's ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser became public More[3] White House: Rod Rosenstein Not Fired, Will Meet with President Trump on Thursday[4] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The White House clarified that President Donald Trump did not fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Monday, despite reports that he had offered his resignation. 'Because the president is at the United Nations General Assembly and has a full schedule with leaders from around the world, they will meet on Thursday when the president returns to Washington, DC,' White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders wrote in a\u00a0statement on Twitter.[5] Statement on Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: pic.twitter.com/yBgAydv9oR[6]   Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) September 24, 2018[7] Several news outlets reported[8] that Rosenstein had verbally offered his resignation to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly after the New York Times[9] reported Friday he discussed wearing a wire to record the president as well as using the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Sanders said that Rosenstein spoke with the president about the news stories, but it is likely that Trump will wait until Thursday to announce his decision. Rosenstein traveled to the White House on Monday,\u00a0according[10] to reports,[11] but was there to attend a previously scheduled meeting More[12] Nikki Haley Quashes 'Absurd' Rumors that Cabinet Was Plotting To Impeach Trump[13] Here's the latest 'Have you stopped beating your wife?' questionbeing used to undermine President Trump's authority Dave Madison Dibble Sep 24, 2018  Many rumors\u00a0have been circulating\u00a0about a potential plan to impeach President Donald Trump from inside his own cabinet, but Nikki Haley[14] is setting the record[15] straight. The latest prediction of Trump's demise includes\u00a0reports[16]\u00a0that some members of the cabinet were considering invoking the 25th Amendment[17] to remove the president from office. The 25th Amendment states: 'Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.' In other words, members of Trump's cabinet could join Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0to pen a letter to leaders in the House and Senate that states that the president is incapable of doing his job. In response, the president can argue that the alleged incapability doesn't exist and Congress will decide with a two-thirds vote to reinstate the president. But if United Nations Ambassador Haley is telling the truth, the details of the 25th Amendment don't matter because no cabinet member is considering that extreme option. ABC News' George Stephanopolous asked the U.N. Ambassador if she has ever been a part of discussions about impeaching the president. Watch: .@GStephanopoulos[18]: 'Have you ever been part of any discussion on perusing the 25th Amendment as a member of the cabinet?' U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley: 'I have never been part of it, I've never heard it that's absurd' <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/27WaWwocZV\">https://t.co/27WaWwocZV</url>[19] #ThisWeek[20] pic.twitter.com/TZEAO2QejE[21]   This Week (@ThisWeekABC) September 23, 2018[22]; 'I've never been part of [impeachment talks]. I've never heard it. I don't think that's a reality at all among all the cabinet members. I've just never heard it. It's absurd,' said Ambassador Haley More[23] The Rebellion at Justice[24]: Don't fire Rosentein, but do release the 2016 FBI-Justice documents. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  Donald Trump keeps saying that the November election is a referendum on him, so a key part of the Democratic strategy is feeding the narrative of chaos in the White House: Trump-baiting so he'll overreact. That's probably the best way to look at the New York Times story on Friday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein contemplated wearing a wire at the White House and removing the President via the 25th Amendment.  Mr. Trump is so far avoiding the advice that he instantly fire Mr. Rosenstein, and rightly so. The alleged comments were made in spring 2017 and it isn't clear how much is true. The story is based on an account by Andrew McCabe about a meeting among Justice officials in May 2017. Mr. McCabe was part of the Jim Comey FBI tong that wants to elect a Democratic Congress and impeach Mr. Trump.  Mr. Rosenstein says he 'never pursued or authorized recording the President and any suggestion that I have ever advocated for the removal of the President is absolutely false.' The idea of using the 25th Amendment to remove a President who isn't physically incapacitated is so dumb that only pundits looking for attention would propose it.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer immediately warned Mr. Trump not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, which in today's Washington means that he wants Mr. Trump to fire him. Then he'll have another media conflagration his candidates can ride to retake Congress. Mr. Rosenstein was no doubt feeling beleaguered in May 2017, and a day after the alleged meeting he appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller. But Mr. Trump was partly responsible for that mess.  Mr. Rosenstein had written an excellent memo explaining why Mr. Comey deserved to be fired as FBI director. But Mr. Trump, taking the anti-Trump media bait, told NBC that the real reason he fired Mr. Comey was because he refused to say publicly that he wasn't investigating Mr. Trump. Then the President tweeted falsely that there may be tapes of Mr. Comey's White House meetings. Mr. Comey leaked his own memos, and a political uproar left Mr. Rosenstein feeling used.  That was 16 months ago. Mr. Mueller has since brought many indictments against former Trump associates but he hasn't provided a sliver of evidence about the Russia-Trump collusion narrative that was supposed to justify the investigation. The immediate battle now is over the midterm election and whether Mr. Trump can stay in office as the impeachment assault begins from Nancy Pelosi's Democrats. Mr. Trump can make personnel changes after the midterms if Republicans still hold the Senate and he can get someone confirmed.  Meanwhile on Friday, President Trump walked back his earlier decision to declassify a host of documents related to the Justice Department and FBI investigations during the 2016 election campaign. This is an odd decision and looks like a mistake. 'I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents. They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe. Also, key Allies' called to ask not to release,' Mr. Trump tweeted Friday. But releasing documents to the public isn't a coverup. It's an act of transparency. Mr. Trump needs to declassify the documents because the FBI and Justice have consistently stonewalled Congress. Releasing documents at this stage can't hurt the Mueller probe. As for the allies, sometimes U.S. democratic accountability has to take precedence over the potential embarrassment of British intelligence.  Releasing the documents would let Americans see for themselves how the FBI and Justice Department justified their decision to start their counterintelligence probe of the Trump campaign and seek a warrant to spy on Carter Page; and whether or how they vetted the notorious Steele dossier. The unredacted emails and texts of Jim Comey's FBI team might also reveal political motivation.  Mr. Trump has agreed to let the Justice Department Inspector General review the documents 'on an expedited basis,' but time is of the essence. If Democrats take the House, they will shut down any attempt to scrutinize the actions of the FBI and Justice in 2016 More[25] Schumer made good on his pledgeThere is no deed too dastardly for him and his lackeys Flashback: Chuck Schumer Pledged to 'Oppose Kavanaugh with Everything I Have'[26]. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promised he would launch an aggressive anti-Brett Kavanaugh campaign, saying he would oppose 'Judge Kavanaugh's nomination with everything' he has, which he stated the same day in July that President Donald Trump nominated Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Brett Kavanaugh Defies 'Grotesque Character Assassination' from the Left[27] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Supreme Court Nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh responded to the latest allegations of sexual misconduct on Monday by denouncing them as smears. 'These are smears, pure and simple. And they debase our public discourse,' he wrote in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'But they are also a threat to any man or woman who wishes to serve our country. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination   if allowed to succeed   will dissuade competent and good people from service.' Kavanuagh's letter expressed frustration with his delayed confirmation vote despite repeating his willingness to testify about the accusations from Christine Ford and a second 'uncorroborated' report in the New Yorker. He also remained defiant against the recent attacks against his character and his family. 'I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process,' he wrote. 'The coordinated effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. The last-minute character assassination will not succeed.' President Donald Trump stood by Kavanaugh on Monday, telling reporters[28] in New York City that he backed his nominee to the Supreme Court 'all the way.' 'In my opinion, it is totally political,' he said, calling the allegations 'one of the single-most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything.' Kavanaugh Claims Give Vulnerable Democrats in Senate Cover to Oppose Him[29] Aside from being a delay tacticthese ridiculous last-minute charges against Kavanaughserve another important purpose Democrats holding offices in districts that voted for Trumpcan now claim to vote against Kavanaugh because of the sexual allegationsrather than because of opposition to his conservative views Dave Reuters Sep 18, 2018  The sexual-misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh may remove pressure that some Democratic senators faced to back his confirmation as a way of reassuring conservative voters in congressional elections just seven weeks away. Since Kavanaugh was nominated[30] to the high court by President Donald Trump, Democratic senators from states that Trump won in 2016 were locked in a dilemma. If they didn't vote in favor of Kavanaugh's confirmation, they would have appeared to be out of step with voters at home and risked losing re-election. Vote for him, and they would hand the president a bipartisan victory. The allegation that Kavanaugh assaulted a woman[31] while in high school, however, now gives those endangered Democrats an escape hatch[32]. They can oppose the nominee without appearing to voters as if they are defying the president, strategists said. Kavanaugh has denied the assault allegation, calling it 'completely false.' 'For those Democrats up for re-election from states that Trump carried, they now have absolutely no reason to vote for Kavanaugh. Period. End of story,' said Jim Manley, a former high-ranking Democratic Senate aide. 'They have all the cover they need.' More[33] Ronan Farrow's New Yorker Piece Debunks Ramirez Allegation Against Kavanaugh[34] At this point, the treacherous deeds of the Democratslook like acts of desperation Not only do Dems not have a positive messagethey feel that they have to invent lies and destroy conservativesjust to seem relevant Dave John Nolte Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The New Yorker's Ronan Farrow and his co-author Jane Mayer are under fire for publishing a second allegation of sexual misconduct[35] against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. When you look at how thin the story is, that criticism might be valid. But Farrow and Mayer deserve credit for writing the full story   a story that not only appears to debunk Deborah Ramirez's allegation but exposes how the institutional left aggressively works behind the scenes to destroy Kavanaugh with spurious accusations. After 35 years of not being sure it was him, Ramirez now alleges that during a drunken dorm party during her and Kavanaugh's freshman year at Yale in 1983, he exposed himself to her in such an aggressive way she ended up accidentally touching his genitals. Obviously, this is a sensational allegation, and the timing is more than a little suspicious. The story appeared on Sunday night just as Christine Blasey Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh began to unravel. Just a few hours earlier, the last of Ford's three witnesses, including a lifelong friend, had not only said (under penalty of imprisonment) they do not recall any misconduct on Kavanaugh's part, they do not even recall attending the 1982 house party where[36] the misconduct supposedly occurred. If anything, though, Ramirez's story is even less credible. Like Ford, neither of Ramirez's witnesses recall the party or the alleged incident, nor does her best friend. What's more, until Ramirez spent six days with her Democrat lawyer, she was unable to identify Kavanaugh as the man who exposed himself. Because of Ramirez's memory problems (she was also quite drunk at the alleged party) and her supposed witnesses stating none of this ever happened, some argue the New Yorker was irresponsible to publish. In fact, the New York Times found the story so lacking in credibility, the paper chose not to publish. But were it not for the New Yorker, we would not have learned how Democrats are willing to manipulate events behind the scenes in their ongoing effort to destroy Kavanaugh with unsubstantiated allegations from more than 30 years ago. The New Yorker informs us: 'In her initial conversations with\u00a0The New Yorker, she was reluctant to characterize Kavanaugh's role in the alleged incident with certainty. After six days of carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney, Ramirez said that she felt confident enough of her recollections to say that she remembers Kavanaugh\u00a0had exposed himself at a drunken dormitory party, thrust his penis in her face, and caused her to touch it without her consent as she pushed him away.' In other words, a full 35 years after the incident occurred, Ramirez (who the New Yorker describes as an activist Democrat) could not put the finger on Kavanaugh as the alleged flasher. Moreover, we learn 'Ramirez acknowledged that there are significant gaps in her memories of the evening' and that at the party she 'became inebriated' and 'was on the floor, foggy and slurring her words.' Nevertheless, after all this time, over the past few days, she became sure it was Kavanaugh thanks to 'carefully assessing her memories and consulting with her attorney.' Thanks to the New Yorker's in-depth reporting, however, we know exactly who the attorney is who helped Ramirez recall her memory   'Stanley Garnett, a former Democratic district attorney' from Boulder,\u00a0Colorado.

Cupp hosted a panel on her 'Unfiltered' on Saturday to discuss the sexual assault allegations lobbed at Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Rep.\u00a0Keith Ellison (D-Minn.) and pointed out the 'very obvious double standard' in the room.  She started right off by putting Democrats on blast for supporting[39] Ellison in the wake of the allegations while meanwhile declaring Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford must be believed[40]: 'Keith Ellison, Democratic Congressman from Minnesota, Deputy Chair of the DNC, running for Attorney General in Minnesota, has been accused by two women of domestic violence.\u00a0Not only aren't Democrats insisting that they be believed and he step aside, he easily won his democratic primary, but at least one of his accusers has said her own party, the democratic party, has smeared and isolated her.' Next, Cupp played a clip from\u00a0Friday night's debate[41] among Minnesota attorney general candidates, during which Ellison questioned his accusers and said he couldn't predict what someone 'might cook up' about him in the future. 'How can democrats explain a very obvious double standard in outrage?' Cupp asked. 'The issue of looking into allegations of rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment need to be done apolitically, and that's really a standard we can't ever veer off of.'

'Every senator that does not try to delay the confirmation hearing is an accomplice and is casting a vote of approval for the subjugation of women's bodies - our exploitation through rape,'\u00a0warned one female protester while occupying Senator Ben Sasse's (R-NE) office.

He should resign,' Mia Farrow wrote It's not apparent that Farrow's tweet was part of a longer thread but it did come hours before her son, Ronan Farrow, published a New Yorker article which included allegations[59] of inappropriate drunken behavior by Judge Kavanaugh by Deborah Ramirez.

Avenatti rose to national prominence representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her quest to break free of a non-disclosure agreement with President Donald Trump; he now purports to represent a third individual accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct. In an email to Mike Davis, Chief Counsel for Nominations for the Senate Judiciary Committee, Avenatti called on the panel to ask Kavanaugh about the meaning of a caption reading 'FFFFFFFourth of July'\u00a0  a code, the lawyer claims, means 'Find'em, French them, Feel them, Finger them, F*ck them, Forget'em.' 'We have reason to believe' that salacious interpretation, Avenatti wrote. 'We request that Mr. Kavanaugh provide an answer as why these entries were made and what they stand for.' Avenatti, whose antics have earned him the nickname 'Creepy Porn Lawyer,'[62] also demanded senators look into Kavanaugh's use of the term 'Devil's Triangle,' which he asserts is a reference to a threesome.

Professor Eun-Jeong Han of Salisbury University began her upper-level Communications course on Wednesday by displaying PowerPoint slides describing what it means to have white privilege. A student in the class took pictures to document portions of the presentation. The presentation slide reads: Being White means rarely or never having to think about it. Three major characteristics of Whites in the U.S.1) White privilege2) A standpoint from which White people view themselves, others, and society The professor's third point about 'being white' was not captured in the image. Another slide titled '50 White privileges' showed an image of a caucasian female with the words 'we're privileged, people see us, not a color' scrawled across her face. Professor Han told Breitbart News the PowerPoint slides were from the textbook assigned in the syllabus, and that the in-class assignment was meant to 'make students think about the privilege that they rarely think about.' More[67] Why the Left Is Consumed With Hate[68]: Lacking worthy menaces to fight, it is driven to find a replacement for racism. Failing this, what is left? Shelby Steele The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  Even before President Trump's election, hatred had begun to emerge on the American left counterintuitively, as an assertion of guilelessness and moral superiority. At the Women's March in Washington the weekend after Mr. Trump's inauguration, the pop star Madonna said, 'I have thought an awful lot of blowing up the White House.' Here hatred was a vanity, a braggadocio meant to signal her innocence of the sort of evil that, in her mind, the White House represented. (She later said the comment was 'taken wildly out of context.') For many on the left a hateful anti-Americanism has become a self-congratulatory lifestyle. 'America was never that great,' New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently said. For radical groups like Black Lives Matter, hatred of America is a theme of identity, a display of racial pride.  For other leftists, hate is a license. Conservative speakers can be shouted down, even assaulted, on university campuses. Republican officials can be harassed in restaurants, in the street, in front of their homes. Certain leaders of the left Rep. Maxine Waters comes to mind are self-appointed practitioners of hate, urging their followers to think of hatred as power itself. How did the American left conceived to bring more compassion and justice to the world become so given to hate? It began in the 1960s, when America finally accepted that slavery and segregation were profound moral failings. That acceptance changed America forever. It imposed a new moral imperative: America would have to show itself redeemed of these immoralities in order to stand as a legitimate democracy.  The genius of the left in the '60s was simply to perceive the new moral imperative, and then to identify itself with it. Thus the labor of redeeming the nation from its immoral past would fall on the left. This is how the left put itself in charge of America's moral legitimacy. The left, not the right not conservatism would set the terms of this legitimacy and deliver America from shame to decency. This bestowed enormous political and cultural power on the American left, and led to the greatest array of government-sponsored social programs in history at an expense, by some estimates, of more than $22 trillion. But for the left to wield this power, there had to be a great menace to fight against a tenacious menace that kept America uncertain of its legitimacy, afraid for its good name. This amounted to a formula for power: The greater the menace to the nation's moral legitimacy, the more power redounded to the left. And the '60s handed the left a laundry list of menaces to be defeated. If racism was necessarily at the top of the list, it was quickly followed by a litany of bigotries ending in 'ism' and 'phobia.' Today's left lacks worthy menaces to fight. It is driven to find a replacement for racism, some sweeping historical wrongdoing that morally empowers those who oppose it. (Climate change?) Failing this, only hatred is left. Hatred is a transformative power. It can make the innocuous into the menacing. So it has become a weapon of choice. The left has used hate to transform President Trump into a symbol of the new racism, not a flawed president but a systemic evil. And he must be opposed as one opposes racism, with a scorched-earth absolutism More[69] DOJ Staffer Caught on Deep State Tape Sting 'No Longer Works for' Department[70] Matthew Boyle Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018 Washington, D.C. - Allison Hrabar, the career paralegal caught on a Project Veritas video sting on the 'Deep State' that was released last week, is no longer with the Department of Justice, a DOJ source confirmed to Breitbart News. 'Allison Hrabar, the Justice Department paralegal who was the subject of the James O'Keefe report, no longer works for the Department effective midnight last night,' a DOJ source told Breitbart News on Monday morning. Hrabar was featured prominently in the second video Project Veritas' James O'Keefe released investigating the 'Deep State': 'After the release of the video, there was a near-immediate push by top conservatives including[71] Americans for Limited Government to get Attorney General Jeff Sessions to remove Hrabar from the Department of Justice.' The Department of Justice announced[72] after the video came out that it was investigating Hrabar's behavior: DEVELOPING: Statement from DOJ on today's vid: 'These allegations are deeply concerning. Department policy prohibits misuse of government resources to advance personal interests. We are looking into this immediately and have referred this matter to the Inspector General as well.' pic.twitter.com/cb6x1g8tu6[73]   James O'Keefe (@JamesOKeefeIII) September 19, 2018[74]; Now, she is-per Department officials-no longer with the DOJ. The circumstances of how her employment was terminated, and exactly what happened internally at the Dept. since late last week, are unclear. In addition to having been a paralegal at DOJ, Hrabar is a top official at the Democratic Socialists of America's Washington, D.C., chapter. Therein lies the rub as to what she was caught doing in the Project Veritas video: She was seen using official government resources for Democratic Socialists of America purposes. One particularly notable incident in which Hrabar was involved[75] as a socialist activist was protesting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen back in the mid-summer when she was eating a restaurant.

Google Publishes Article Instructing Congress on How to Regulate Them[78] Lucas Nolan Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Google published a document recently that outlines how the tech titan wants Congress to regulate them ahead of a Senate hearing this week. The document[79], titled 'Framework for Responsible Data Protection Regulation,' outlines how tech companies such as Google should be regulated and has been published shortly before Google's upcoming Senate hearing on consumer data privacy set for this Wednesday. The intro to the Google document states: 'In our digital era, a growing array of organizations use personal data to provide a growing range of services. Responsible data use can unlock benefits for people, companies, and other organizations around the world. Regulation can protect individuals and communities from harm and misuse of data, and help maintain the trust that enables innovation and change. Building on our efforts to provide innovative services that rely on personal data, and on our experience with evolving international privacy laws, we have synthesized the following set of high-level principles. These principles are based on established privacy regimes and are meant to apply to organizations that make decisions regarding the collection and use of personal information. This framework helps Google evaluate legal proposals and advocate for smart, interoperable, and adaptable data protection regulations' Jason Kint, the CEO of trade association Digital Content Next, told\u00a0Adweek that he believes Google's sudden release of this document was an attempt to go on the offensive ahead of Wednesdays hearing. 'The industry needs to take a hard look at Google's data collection and usage practices, particularly those happening passively, out of context, when the user has no idea they are even interacting with Google,' Kint said. 'Google dominates nearly every dimension of digital media, recognizing most users in their daily activities, and I think you'll find this framework only accelerates its dominance.' Google may have reason to be worried about the issue of regulation and attempt to influence the sort of regulation that they receive, especially given recent reports of an executive order recently drafted[80] that would see companies like Google investigated for antitrust violations. The executive order is reportedly[81] just awaiting President Trump's signature before the investigation can take place. The order is still only a draft and has yet to be reviewed by other government agencies according to White House officials More[82] Progressives Urge Business to Block Trump's Merit-Immigration Reform[83] This is what truly deserves to be called 'corporate welfare'Entire industries have risen up around our Welfare systemand to companies in those industries that receive money from Welfare recipientsthe more people on Welfare, the better Dave Neil Munro Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Progressives and lobbyists are urging business groups to block President Donald Trump's 'public charge' merit-reform of the nation's immigration laws. The reform allocates green cards to foreigners who less likely to need taxpayers' aid because they are skilled, healthy, or young. The reform likely saves many billions of dollars that would be otherwise spent on the welfare, healthcare,\u00a0and retirement costs of unskilled, unhealthy or old migrants. That reform is a big economic gain[84] for ordinary Americans, but also a big economic loss for business because every dollar spent on needy legal (or illegal) immigrants is also a hidden subsidy for business, including landlords, hospitals, groceries, and Wall Street. 'Some of the harms consequences of the radical 'public charge' rule proposed by DHS [are] 'reduced revenues for healthcare providers participating in Medicaid' 'reduced revenues for grocery retailers participating in SNAP [in effect, nearly all grocery stores],' said Tweets[85] from Shawn Fremstad, a pro-migration leader at two progressive advocacy groups. Fremstad is a 'senior associate' at the Center for Economic and Policy Research and a 'senior fellow' at the Center for American Progress. He his Tweeted claim by displaying quotes from the 477-page draft regulation[86] released Sept. 22. He argued that the reform would also ensure: 'increases in uncompensated care in which a treatment or service is not paid for by an insurer or patient' 'reduced revenues for agricultural producers who grow foods that are eligible for purchase using SNAP' 'reduced revenues for landlords participating in federally funded housing programs' 'new direct indirect costs' on 'immigration lawyers, immigration advocacy groups, health care providers of all types, non-profit organizations, non-governmental organizations, and religious organizations' The Department of Homeland Security regulation says it will impact roughly 382,000 foreign people per year who want to become legal immigrants. The regulation sketches possible savings of perhaps $10 billion per year while spotlighting losses for business More[87] Sen. Gillibrand Continues to Advocate for ICE to Be Abolished: 'Get Rid' of Them[88] Sydney Monduy Independent Journal Review Sep 24, 2018  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) is continuing to call for the abolition of ICE. During a town hall meeting in New York, Gillibrand gave her opinion on ICE. 'I couldn't be more against what this administration is doing, and I think what we can do is just keep speaking out, keep demanding something different,' She has been very outspoken[89] about issues she has with the agency, claiming that it has become[90] a 'deportation' agency.

'The reason why we should get rid of ICE, reimagine it and build something that works, is because it doesn't work,' said Gillibrand. 'What they're doing right now is unconscionable, and I think they should be able to fund the anti-terrorism stuff. But the enforcement removal operations are doing a terrible job, and we should reimagine it, and actually have a real immigration system that works.' However, ICE has been focusing their efforts on arresting illegal immigrants[96] with criminal backgrounds and has deported hundreds of people who had prior convictions. Last year, ICE officials[97] stated that they made 127,000 arrests that had a positive impact on drug and child predator crime The video and more[98] Poll: Plurality of Latinos 'Less Likely to Vote' for Candidates Who Want to Abolish ICE[99] Liberals don't seem to realize that many Latinos in the U.Scame here to get away from the crime in their home countries The last thing they want is for criminal elements to cross freely into our country Dave Tony Lee Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  A plurality of Latino voters are 'less likely to vote' for a candidate in the 2018 midterm elections who supports abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), according to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Telemundo poll. The poll[100], released on Sunday, found that 36% of Hispanic voters said they are 'less likely to vote' for a candidate who 'favors abolishing ICE' while 33% said they are 'more likely to vote.' Another 26% said there is 'no difference' and 5% said they were 'not sure.' After Democratic-Socialist candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won a primary against a longtime incumbent Democrat on a platform that included abolishing ICE, Democrats like Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) jumped on board and called for ICE to be abolished. But an August Associated Press/NORC poll [101]revealed how unpopular 'abolishing ICE' is, as the poll found that just 25% of Democrats and 25% of Americans want ICE to be abolished More[102] At U.N., Trump Will Face an Iran Gap With European Allies[103]  This week will be the first General Assembly gathering since President Trump quit the Iran nuclear accord  Farnaz Fassihi and Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  President Trump and his European counterparts square off at the United Nations this week on key policy issues dividing old allies: the fate of the Iran nuclear agreement and how to constrain the Islamic Republic's regional ambitions. The week of marathon diplomacy in New York will be the first time that heads of states of the U.S., European nations and Iran gather at the General Assembly since Mr. Trump quit the 2015 Iran nuclear accord[104] in May and will put U.S.-European divisions on global display. Mr. Trump and top officials plan to use the U.N. forum including a speech by Mr. Trump on Tuesday to world leaders, a Security Council session he is chairing and a series of meetings to denounce Iran, and mobilize international support for isolating the country through crippling sanctions. A key component of their complaint[105] will be Iran's meddling in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen and its continued financial and military support of militant groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. But the Europeans plan to counter the U.S. position that the nuclear agreement has failed and that new sanctions must be imposed. European countries have tried to help Iran navigate the sanctions[106], including on banking transactions, by creating economic incentives so Iran stays committed to the deal, though their ability to maintain economic ties with Tehran is limited and the continent's companies are rapidly pulling out. Iran, for its part, will attempt to widen the gap between the U.S. and Europe by portraying itself as abiding by its commitments while the U.S. disregards international accords. British, French and German diplomats plan to meet Monday with counterparts from Iran and other parties to the accord Russia and China to try to persuade Tehran to stick with the agreement as U.S. sanctions on Iran's oil exports take hold in November and foreign companies continue to depart[107].  Most Western businesses appear to be heeding Washington's warnings it will punish those found violating its economywide sanctions campaign. The risk of losing access to the world's largest economy and most important financial markets isn't worth keeping ties to a country whose gross domestic product is dwarfed by the U.S. Companies such as Boeing[108] Co. and German industrial firm Wintershall have either pulled out completely or said they are planning an exit. Ahead of Nov. 4, when some of the strongest sanctions kick in, Iran crude imports have fallen over the last four months in many of Tehran's biggest customers, analysts say. The remaining parties to the 2015 accord are expected to issue a statement in support of the deal after the meeting. The sharply differing views will put Washington and Europe on opposing courses on the world stage. 'Talking about Iran, talking about their proxies and the other things they are doing to destabilize the Middle East will certainly be a topic,' U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley said Thursday in a preview of the administration's priorities More[109] Russia and Iran, Military Allies, Are Fast Becoming Economic Rivals[110] Nations' partnership in Syria is giving way to a competition that is exacerbating Tehran's economic troubles One of the great side benefits of President Trump's sanctions on Iranis that it aggravates the rivalries already existing between it and Russia Russia and Iran are long-time historical rivalsand Russia would gladly eat away at a weakened Iranparticularly regarding disputed oil rights in the Caspian Sea Dave Sune Engel Rasmussen and Benoit Faucon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  President Trump's sanctions on Iran are working brilliantlyThere is only one thing that could screw it up Dave A military alliance between Russia and Iran [111]to back Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is giving way to an economic rivalry as Syria's war winds down, a contest Moscow is leading. The friction is adding pressure on Tehran as U.S. sanctions [112]squeeze Iran's economy. Russia's ascendancy also illustrates the muscular role it is playing in the Middle East through oil diplomacy and strategic economic ties. Russia also has increased arms and commercial trade with Iran's regional arch rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel, and continues to tussle with Iran over rights to natural resources in the Caspian Sea. In Syria, Russia is outdoing Iran for lucrative opportunities to rebuild the shattered country, even as the two continue to cooperate on the battlefield.  Russian oil production has soared in recent months as Iran's exports have fallen, drawing criticism from Iranian officials that Moscow is taking advantage of Tehran's vulnerability. 'Iran is in an unenviable position,' said Mark N. Katz, professor at George Mason University and expert in Russian relations in the Middle East. 'And Moscow is taking advantage of the situation.' Iran's trouble rose in May when President Trump pulled the U.S. out of a multinational deal intended to curb Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for economic benefits and later announced new economic sanctions. That shocked Iran's already fragile economy[113]. The strategy has crippled oil exports, prompting the currency to plummet and inflation and unemployment to soar. The dire economy prompted Parliament to force President Hassan Rouhani to dismiss cabinet members. A second round of U.S. sanctions is set to begin on Nov. 4. The fastest-emerging front in the Iranian-Russian rivalry is oil. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh withdrew plans to attend a meeting on Sunday of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in Algeria. Iran has accused Saudi Arabia and Russia of teaming up to push for higher oil output to push down prices and hurt Iran's economy.  Since the U.S. exit from the nuclear deal, Iranian exports of oil and a light petroleum called condensate have collapsed.\u00a0Officials at the state-run National Iranian Oil Co. expect crude shipments to drop to about 1.5 million barrels a day this month, down by a third from June, say people familiar with the country's ports loading program. Russia, meanwhile, has increased its oil output by 250,000 barrels to 11.6 million barrels a day, according to the International Energy Agency. In August, Russia's oil and gas revenue rose nearly 50% from the same period last year, to about $83 billion. Most of the additional Russian oil is going to buyers that have reduced purchases of Iran oil for fear of running afoul of U.S. sanctions, such as Greece, Italy and Turkey, according to official data, shipping trackers and company officials More[114] Iran Warns US, Israel of Revenge After Parade Attack[115] Reuters Sep 24, 2018  Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Monday that the attackers who killed 25 people at a military parade were paid by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and that Iran would 'severely punish' those behind the bloodshed. The deputy head of Iran's Revolutionary Guards also accused the United States and Israeli of involvement in the attack and he said they should expect a devastating response from Tehran. In the southwestern Iranian city of Ahvaz, thousands packed the streets to mourn the victims of Saturday's assault, many chanting 'Death to Israel and America'. Twelve members of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were among the 25 dead. The coffins, wrapped in the flag of the Islamic Republic, were carried by the mourners. Many held pictures of a four-year-old boy killed in the incident, one of the worst such attacks against Iran's the most powerful military force. Four assailants fired on a viewing stand in Ahvaz where Iranian officials had gathered to watch an annual parade marking the start of Iran's 1980-88 war with Iraq. 'Based on reports, this cowardly act was done by people who the Americans\u00a0come to help when they are trapped in Syria and Iraq, and are paid by Saudi Arabia and the UAE,' Khamenei said on his official website. Guards Brigadier General Hossein Salami, in a speech broadcast on state TV, said: 'You have seen our revenge before. You will see that our response will be crushing and devastating and you will regret what you have done.' Tasnim new agency also quoted Salami as saying that the 'horrific crime' exposed the dark side of an alliance that the United States, Saudi Arabia and Israel had created to counter Iranian influence in the region. The secretary of Iran's National Security Council said Tehran needed to talk to its neighbors to avoid tensions. 'It's essential to be fully aware and increase our constructive dialogues to neutralize the plots of enemies who want to create suspicion and disagreement among regional countries,' Ali Shamkhani said. He also criticized the United States, saying U.S. sanctions against Iran were illegal and that President Donald Trump was using them as a tool for 'personal revenge'. ANTAGONIZE The United Arab Emirates, a close ally of Saudi Arabia and Washington, rejected Iran's allegations alluding to its involvement in the violence. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, asked by a Fox News interviewer if the United States played any role in the attack, said: 'When you have a security incident at home, blaming others is an enormous mistake.' The loss of innocent lives was tragic, Pompeo added. There has been no reaction yet from Saudi Arabia or Israel. Accusations against Gulf countries will almost certainly antagonize Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia. The oil super-powers are waging a war for influence across the Middle East, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. It is, however, highly unlikely the Guards will strike any of its foes directly and risk sparking a regional conflict More[116] OPEC Sees Competition With U.S. Shale Oil Subsiding After 2023[117]  U.S. shale could slow significantly in less than five years, OPEC report predicts  This forecast sounds like wishful thinking. OPEC is not a disinterested forecaster Ten years ago, no one would have predicted the resurgence of U.S. energy productionthat fracking has broughtso who's to say there won't be new discoveries to expand America's potential? Regardless of this forecast's accuracythis it underscores how important it is to move the country to EVs and plug-ins These care are very reliable, and a slew of new models are becoming availableMake your next car and EV or plug-in Dave Christopher Alessi The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  ALGIERS U.S. shale oil production will peak by the late 2020s, triggering renewed demand for OPEC crude after an expected decline and stagnation, the oil cartel said Sunday. In its latest forecast on the global oil landscape, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said it expects U.S. shale growth to 'slow significantly' after 2023, before peaking at 14.3 million barrels a day between 2027 and 2028. Output should then fall to an average of 12.1 million barrels a day by 2040, according to OPEC. The use of hydraulic fracturing in the U.S. to drill for oil in shale rock known as fracking has dramatically reshaped[118] the face of the global oil industry over the past decade, rivaling OPEC for market share. Shale was largely behind a glut of American oil that flooded the market over four years ago, leading oil prices to fall to $30 a barrel from more than a $100 a barrel in late 2014. In 2018, U.S. shale production is growing faster than it did during the boom years of 2011 to 2014, the International Energy Agency said earlier this year.[119] The IEA has forecast that U.S. shale oil production will plateau in the late 2020s, while total non-OPEC production should decline. OPEC projects that 'the strongest annual increases are seen in the near-term, in which total U.S. tight oil increases by an average of 1.4 million barrels a day' annually from this year to 2020. The world's appetite for OPEC crude, meanwhile, should fall to 31.6 million barrels a day in 2023, compared with 32.6 million barrels a day in 2017, before again rising to current levels when U.S. shale supply peaks, the cartel said. 'Thereafter, a gradual decline in non-OPEC liquids supply, coupled with moderate, but sustained global demand growth, leads to a steady increase in demand for OPEC crude, which rises to nearly 40 million barrels a day by 2040,' the OPEC report noted More[120] As Migrants Turn to Spain, a Welcome Mat Shows Signs of Wear[121]  Political winds shift in country sheltered from rise of anti-immigrant parties across Europe  Jeannette Neumann The Wall Street Journal Sept. 23, 2018  MADRID One of Pedro S\u00e1nchez's first acts when he became Spain's prime minister in June was to provide safe harbor to a ship carrying 600 migrants[122] rescued from the Mediterranean, after it was refused entry by Italy's anti-immigration government. Two months later, when 116 migrants breached the border fence at a Spanish enclave in Africa, Mr. S\u00e1nchez returned them to Morocco the next day. Spain has become Europe's main entry point[123] for migrants this year, overtaking Greece and Italy, and raising the stakes for Mr. S\u00e1nchez and other leaders who want to maintain the country's position as one of Europe's most immigration-friendly countries. More than 34,000 seaborne migrants have landed on Spain's shores so far this year, a threefold increase from last year. Italy and Greece have each received about 20,000 arrivals so far this year. Despite a sharp fall in migration to Italy, Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has kept up anti-immigration statements[124]. Spain wants the world to know it isn't Italy. 'We defend a migration policy that's respectful of human rights,' Mr. S\u00e1nchez said last week. Pro-immigration activists said the speedy repatriations in August from the Spanish enclave of Ceuta were illegal because the migrants had no time to register and process asylum claims. Mr. S\u00e1nchez said a bilateral agreement allowed him to send them straight back to Morocco. The new leader's different responses to the rescue vessel and border breach show him trying to support Spaniards' generally pro-immigration views while avoiding a backlash from those concerned about maintaining a secure border. Spaniards are among the Europeans most likely to consider immigration an opportunity for their country rather than a problem, according to a European Union survey in April. Most Spaniards think their country's integration of immigrants has been successful, the survey found. At the same time, tensions are visible at the local level. In Barcelona, the far-left mayor faces pressure from locals to control irregular immigrant street vendors Ferm\u00edn Villar, head of a Barcelona business association, said the vendors create unfair competition for local retailers because they don't pay rent or taxes. Immigrants 'can come, we have to help them, but [city officials] aren't demanding anything in return,' Mr. Villar said. 'Immigrants have all the same rights but also the same obligations.' Spanish conservatives, now in opposition, are less critical of immigration than many right-leaning politicians elsewhere in Europe. But supporters of Spain's current approach to immigration are growing concerned that the increase in migration could sow the seeds of something Spanish democracy has never seen: a far-right nativist movement Amid the influx, Spain's conservative Popular Party has sought to sharpen its conservative credentials[125] on immigration and other issues, in part to combat a new center-right rival, Ciudadanos. With its harder tone, the Popular Party is also seeking to steal the thunder of the anti-immigrant message of the country's only far-right party, the tiny Vox More[126] Pope Francis: Virgin Mary Stands by the 'Deported'[127] The Pope is just making stuff up when he says that'Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Old Catholics, Muslims, Jewslived together in peace until the arrival of totalitarian ideologies' Any true historian can easily verify that the Pope is dead wrongThe easiest places to expose his lie are in the historiesof the Byzantine[128] and Ottoman[129] empires  Is the Pope really this ignorant?Or is he spreading propaganda and hoping that we are the ignorant ones? Dave Thomas D. Williams, PhD. Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  Pope Francis has continued pushing his pro-immigration message in his trip to the Baltic states, urging his hearers to 'receive' the stranger even when he threatens our security and well-being. The Virgin Mary 'stands near those who suffer, those from whom the world flees, including those who have been put on trial, condemned by all, deported,' the pope said[130] during his homily Monday at the Shrine of the Mother of God in Latvia. 'Nor is it that they are simply oppressed or exploited; they are completely 'outside the system', on the very fringes of society,' Francis said. 'The Mother also stands close by them, steadfast beneath their cross of incomprehension and suffering.' In this Latvia leg of his three-nation visit to the Baltic states, Pope Francis denounced isolationism just as several European nations have begun to insist more on national sovereignty and the right to secure borders. The pope condemned 'ways of thinking that would have us be suspicious of others,' even when statistics show that 'we would be better off, more prosperous and more secure just by ourselves.' At those times, he said, 'Mary and the disciples of these lands invite us to 'receive' our brothers and sisters, to care for them, in a spirit of universal fraternity.' Earlier in his trip, the pope praised[131] Lithuanians for their history of accepting and integrating immigrants, suggesting that they have an important lesson to impart to their European brothers and sisters. Throughout its history, 'Lithuania was able to shelter, receive and accept peoples of various ethnic groups and religions,' Francis said in an address to Lithuanian authorities Saturday. 'All found a place to live in this land - Lithuanians, Tartars, Poles, Russians, Belarusians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Germans.' 'Catholics, Orthodox, Protestants, Old Catholics, Muslims, Jews - lived together in peace until the arrival of totalitarian ideologies that, by sowing violence and lack of trust, undermined its ability to accept and harmonize differences,' he said More[132] Vatican Cardinal: Pope Francis Is 'Ice-Cold, Cunning Machiavellian'[133] Thomas D. Williams, PhD Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  The German progressive weekly\u00a0Der Spiegel has ended its love affair with the pope, declaring that the Church's sex abuse crisis is 'increasingly about Pope Francis.' In a stunning cover article[134] titled 'The Silence of the Shepherds,' the magazine blasts the pope for his unwillingness to answer direct questions regarding what he knew about the serial homosexual abuse by U.S. Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and when he knew it. An August 25 report[135] from a high-ranking Vatican official declared that the pope was aware of McCarrick's misdeeds at least as early as 2013 since the official personally informed him and yet lifted sanctions against McCarrick that Pope Benedict had imposed and employed him as a consultant in naming new American bishops. Yet when journalists asked[136] the pope whether these allegations were true, and when indeed he had learned the facts about McCarrick, the pope neither confirmed nor denied the report, preferring instead the strategy of 'no comment.' According to Der Spiegel, Francis, who started as a 'brilliant reformer,' now threatens to squander his legacy because 'he often speaks at inopportune moments, yet in important moments remains silent.' More[137] Chicago Catholic Priest Who Burned Rainbow Flag Removed from Parish[138] This priest was absolutely right in doing what he didHe exposed the sexual culture that the LGBT community fosters within the Church Dave Katherine Rodriguez Breitbart News 24 Sep 2018  A Chicago Catholic priest who burned an LGBTQ rainbow flag in defiance of a cardinal's orders has been removed from his parish as of Friday Chicago Cardinal Blase\u00a0Cupich allegedly sent two of his deputies to inform Rev. Paul Kalchik on Friday that the archdiocese would be removing him from his pastoral duties after Kalchik burned the rainbow flag adorned with a cross in a closed-door ceremony, the Chicago Sun-Times reported[139]. The Archdiocese of Chicago also released a letter saying Kalchik would take time off 'to receive pastoral support.' 'It has become clear to me that Fr. Kalchik must take time away from the parish to receive pastoral support so his needs can be assessed,' Cupich wrote in a letter released by the archdiocese. A spokesperson for the archdiocese claimed 'this decision has been in motion for some time and is not directly due to the flag-burning.' The Chicago cardinal warned Rev. Paul Kalchik a priest at Resurrection Parish in the Avondale section of Chicago not to burn the flag, but Kalchik said he ignored the cardinal's warning and performed[140] a closed-door 'exorcism ceremony' where he burned the flag with seven parishioners in a fire pit. The flag had been featured behind the church's altar in the past, but parishioners said it had not been displayed for years. The 56-year-old priest announced in a church bulletin released September 2 that he planned to torch the flag after discovering it in storage. News of the flag-burning spread, prompting[141] LGBTQ activists to stage protests outside the church on Wednesday, calling Kalchik's actions a 'hate crime.' The North Side priest said he performed the ceremony because he felt the Chicago archdiocese was not adequately handling the sex abuse scandals or addressing the issue of homosexuality in the church More[142] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: Rosenstein's Departure; Nikki Haley on Impeachment Rumors; More[143] appeared first on Western Free Press[144].

According to court documents filed by prosecutors, Wahhaj was training the children to carry out school shootings. Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Wahhaj without bond for felony child abuse. He is also the subject of an extradition warrant from Georgia on charges of kidnapping his own son from the state in December. </p><p>His son was not among the starving children rescued from the compound. There are fears the remains[2] of an as-yet unidentified child found at the compound could be Wahhaj's son. Prosecutors said[3] on Wednesday that Wahhaj and four accomplices possessed an AR-15 rifle and four pistols with ample ammunition and were training the children to commit school shootings.  Wahhaj's father, who was born under the name Jeffrey Kearse but now also uses the name 'Siraj Wahhaj,' is an imam in New York who was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He served as a character witness in the trial of mastermind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, also known as the 'Blind Sheikh.' The New York Post reported[4] on Monday that the elder Wahhaj is currently the head of the Majid at-Taqwa mosque in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The other defendants in the compound case are the younger Siraj Wahhaj's wife, his two sisters, and his brother-in-law. The Post quoted a January Facebook post from the elder Wahhaj that implied his son, the other co-conspirators, and a total of 12 of his grandchildren had gone missing and were 'traveling together.'  The 11 living children rescued from the compound, plus the child's remains that were recovered, would add up to 12 kids. The missing boy, named Abdul-Ghani, was 3 years old at the time his mother said her husband Siraj Wahhaj abducted him from Georgia; Monday marked his fourth birthday.  The warrant filed in Georgia stated[5] that Wahhaj planned to perform an 'exorcism' on the boy, who suffered from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, had chronic seizures, and was unable to walk on his own More[6] Democrat Darling Linda Sarsour Praises Imam Siraj Wahhaj   Radical Islamist Linked to World Trade Center Bombing and Father of NM Terrorist[7] Jim Hoft Gateway Pundit August 8, 2018  Muslim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was arrested last week at a compound in New Mexico. Wahhaj was training children to commit mass shootings at US schools. Siraj ibn Wahhaj is the son of a Brooklyn imam[8] who was named as a possible co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Liberal leader Linda Sarsour is a huge fan of Imam Wahhaj despite his terrorist past.

Notice that de Blasio didn't accuse Fox News of purveying fake news He accused FNC of providing a different narrative from the Democrat-controlled Mainstream Media's De Blasio would obviously prefer a state-controlled media, and a Democrat-controlled state Dave Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, told interviewers that the United States of America would be a 'more unified country' without Fox News.\u00a0 De Blasio told The Guardian's[14] Ben Jacobs that Fox News founder, Rupert Murdoch, is entirely responsible for President Donald Trump taking office.\u00a0 The mayor directly pointed to Murdoch's company, News Corp, the parent company[15] to many media outlets including the Wall Street Journal and Fox.\u00a0 'If you could remove News Corp from the last 25 years of American history, we would be in an entirely different place,' said de Blasio. De Blasio specifically condemned Murdoch's companies for adding to the conversation and causing division between Americans.\u00a0 '[Without News Corp] we would be a more unified country. We would not be suffering a lot of the negativity and divisiveness we're going through right now,' said de Blasio. 'I can't ignore that.' Some conservatives found this statement to be bold, especially coming from a man who strikes division so often. De Blasio has unnecessarily\u00a0added to division many times.  For example, in 2016, de Blasio picked a war[16] against Chick-Fil-A because their owner is a Christian who believes in traditional marriage\u00a0 More[17] WaPo Uses Soros-Funded Group to Attack GAI Voter Fraud Expos\u00e9 on Day of Book Launch[18] De Blasio would much rather have all news media behave like the Washington Post Dave Eric Eggers Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  What passes for 'journalism' today? Washington Post reporter Eli Rosenberg contacted my organization, the Government Accountability Institute, at midnight to comment on an incendiary piece[19] challenging our groundbreaking work on voter fraud. For some strange reason, we were unavailable at that time. He then promptly published the story at 5:45 a.m., noting that 'GAI declined to comment on Tuesday morning.' His actions eliminate even the most charitable interpretations of anything resembling journalistic fairness. His article is a hit piece posing as a news article. He's clearly doing the bidding of left-wing activists who are concerned by our data-driven research that demonstrates real evidence of the threat of voter fraud Rosenberg cites these activists as 'experts' to say voter fraud is not a problem. Who are these 'disinterested' experts? The Post cites Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap as an authority. Dunlap served on President Trump's Advisory Commission on Election Integrity and last week released documents he claimed showed no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Case closed? Hardly. First, the story fails to identify Dunlap as a progressive Democrat. It doesn't mention that Dunlap was accused by other commission members of leaking internal documents to friendly press associates who then favorably reported leaked emails, sometimes within the hour. The article further fails to mention that. Fellow commission member J. Christian Adams, a former Department of Justice Civil Rights attorney and president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, said Dunlap[20] was actively sabotaging the commission More[21] The Facebook Distraction[22] A study shows that it was a tussle between new and old media that shaped the race. Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  A study[23] last year of the 2016 election by six scholars affiliated with Harvard's Berkman Klein Center got virtually zero play, and it's not hard to understand why. It found that social media 'engagement' that shaped the election outcome overwhelmingly was sparked by the traditional profit-seeking, left-tilting national media, plus new-style, right-wing outlets like Breitbart and not by fake news sites or Russian bots. 'The 'fake news' framing of what happened in the 2016 campaign .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a distraction,' says the study. The real difference maker in 2016 was the rise of highly propagandistic, dissenting, right-wing media, but the authors are far from certain that its arrival should be considered an 'attack on democracy, rather than its expression.' What little press coverage the study got focused on its account of Breitbart's success in 'shopping' the Clinton Foundation story to the mainstream media. 'If Donald Trump's support had been limited to readers of Breitbart, he would never have won the electoral college,' the authors say. But isn't this virtually the ideal in a test tube? Dissenting new media force mainstream outlets to notice a story, but also to vet it? By now you may be thinking of Facebook[24] 's Rob Goldman, who was pilloried for a tweet that criticized press accounts of Russia's Facebook activities that 'align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.' You may be thinking of Mark Zuckerberg's statement, before he was forced to recant, that it was 'silly' to imagine Facebook affecting the election outcome. The Harvard study amounts to a comprehensive debunking of a hysterical BuzzFeed report that unfortunately remains influential. The news site claimed that, during the last three months of the campaign, the top 20 election stories from 'hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs' outperformed the top 20 stories from legitimate sites in terms of Facebook engagement. The problem here should be apparent. Dozens of news sites would have covered the same legitimate stories, but their 'engagement' wasn't measured, as it should have been to compare the traction gained by specific real vs. specific fake stories.  As a separate study[25] in the Columbia Journalism Review also notes, 'engagement' with fake news often has more to do with its 'entertainment value' than its believability. Dartmouth College's Brendan Nyhan, another debunker of the fake-news hysteria, points out[26] what anybody in charge of spending ad dollars already knows: People just aren't that influenceable. Even if fake news were as effective as TV advertising, concludes[27] yet another careful study, 'the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point.'

In the U.K., Infowars is at number four on the App Store's free news chart, beating Sky News, Mail Online, the Sun, the Guardian, BuzzFeed, and the Telegraph. In Canada, Infowars is at number three under the same chart, just behind Twitter and Reddit. On Tuesday, Infowars was the fourth most popular free app on the App Store, overtaking CNN, which prompted[49] CNN to lobby for the app's removal More[50] Alex Jones Claims 5.6 Million New Infowars Subscribers Since Big Tech Blacklisting[51] Facebook's Problem With Veterans[52] Its algorithm treats our nonpolitical site as 'political content.' David Gale The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  How about if we ALL leave the island? Dave After 18 years as an executive at MTV, I decided to start a media brand for an underserved audience: American military veterans and their families.  We Are the Mighty[53], which launched in 2014, has intentionally stayed away from hard news, politics or anything that tries to polarize veterans. Because our entire purpose is to engage this audience, we rely heavily on social media, especially our Facebook page[54]. At first we found, as many publishers have, that there was no better partner than Facebook[55] , the company whose mission statement is 'to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together .\u00a0.\u00a0. and express what matters to them.' Despite Facebook's frequent and inscrutable changes, our business continued to thrive. We were rewarded with likes, shares and comments for our authentic posts, positive message and high engagement. Thanks to Facebook's enormous scale, we could reach a monthly audience of millions. If we stayed true to our values and remained assiduously nonpolitical, positive and honest, we assumed we could withstand the inevitable tweaks to the algorithm. Then in June, Facebook said it had changed its policies 'in response to criticism over how its ad network was able to be manipulated during elections.' These policies require publishers to label anything considered 'political' or 'issue-based advertising.' Evidently, if anything in our posts uses the word 'military,' we are classified as a 'political' advertiser as seen on Facebook's Advertiser Help Center[56] in its list of 'National Issues of Public Importance' and must be labeled as such. Publishers like We Are the Mighty must register as creators of 'political advertising' to target audiences with such content. Casting such a wide net has a profound effect on a company whose objective is to provide vets with a space free of politics. These men and women joined the military to defend the Constitution and America, not a political party or agenda. Facebook's position that all content relating to our community be labeled 'political advertising' is antithetical to the very nature of their solemn oath to this country More[57] Ann Coulter: Sarah Jeong Better Drive Carefully![58] Ann Coulter Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  If you're worried about the social media monopolies censoring speech, just be happy they can't put you in prison. Federal prosecutors are celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Charlottesville, Virginia, 'Unite the Right' rally   isn't this the 'paper' anniversary?   by indicting James Fields for 'hate.' Fields has already been charged with murder in state court. (I would think that 'hate' would be subsumed by a murder charge.) But the federal 'hate crimes' statute allows the feds to skirt the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy   at least for certain kinds of 'hate.'   The stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum by assailants yelling 'Get the Jew!': NOT a federal hate crime.   The brutal kidnapping and murder of a young white couple in Knoxville, Tennessee, by black youths: NOT a federal hate crime.   The torture of a mentally disabled kid in Chicago, by assailants saying 'F  white people!' and 'F  Trump!': NOT a federal hate crime. (Curiously, none of the attackers was Sarah Jeong.)   A white man killing a white woman by driving into a crowd of left-wing protesters: THAT'S a federal hate crime. To make their case, prosecutors did a deep dive into Fields' social media postings to prove that, yes, while he might have killed a white woman in this particular case, he's still a racist. The second paragraph of the indictment states: 'Prior to August 12, 2017, Defendant JAMES ALEX FIELDS JR. obtained multiple social media accounts, which he used to express his beliefs regarding race, national origin, religion and other topics. On these accounts, FIELDS expressed and promoted his belief that white people are superior to other races and peoples; expressed support of the social and racial policies of Adolf Hitler and Nazi-era Germany, including the Holocaust; and espoused violence against African Americans, Jewish people and members of other racial, ethnic and religious groups he perceived to be non-white. FIELDS also expressed these views directly in interactions with individuals known to him.' GUILTY! Wait   what? Again, Fields is a white man charged with murdering a white woman. This is a prosecution of Fields for Bad Thought, utterly oblivious to not only the Constitution's double jeopardy clause, but the free speech clause and also simple common sense. It's like a parody of what serious people feared about criminalizing 'hate.' Contrary to common belief on college campuses, there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment. Pimply teenaged boys writing snotty remarks about blacks and Jews is every bit as constitutionally protected as an Asian girl on The New York Times' editorial board writing snotty things about white men, although the latter pays better More[59] Is Liberal Racism a Horse of a Different Color?[60] Bigotry is bigotry, whether systemic, as at Harvard, or idiosyncratic, like Sarah Jeong's Twitter feed.  Jason L. Riley The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  Be honest. Are you really surprised that the New York Times has stood by its decision to hire Sarah Jeong as an editorial board member even after it was revealed she spent years on social media making openly racist and sexist remarks about white men? You may be outraged, sure. But surprised? To paraphrase a well-known political figure, Ms. Jeong could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot a white person without losing the support of liberals. It's a safe bet she was tapped by the Times because of these racial prejudices, not despite them. Editorial board members are hired to help formulate and express the official position of a newspaper. Ms. Jeong is being hired to speak for the Times, and they like where she's coming from. The Grey Lady attacks President Trump as a racist and sexist on a near-daily basis, and columnists like Charles Blow write about little else. So is it hypocritical for the paper to hire and defend a new editorial board member who has made no secret of her own biases? Of course it is, but that's considered beside the point by people who share Ms. Jeong's worldview. The liberals who control most major media outlets specialize in applying different standards to different groups. Like the Times, Twitter[61] had no problem with Ms. Jeong's repugnant observations. Scores of tweets that included offensive phrases '#cancelwhitepeople'; 'are White people genetically disposed to burn faster in the sun?'; 'White people have stopped breeding. you'll all go extinct soon. that was my plan all along' didn't faze Jack Dorsey's content monitors. But when conservative activist Candace Owens decided last weekend to reproduce Ms. Jeong's posts and replace 'white' with 'black' or 'Jewish,' Twitter temporarily suspended her account. Following a backlash, Twitter restored the account and claimed that 'we made an error.' Of course, the Times can hire whomever it pleases. But if it's going to give the likes of Ms. Jeong a pass while lecturing us about growing intolerance on the political right, how seriously should readers take the paper's nonstop Trump-is-a-bigot coverage? The president's attacks on the media are often misguided and overstated his daughter Ivanka is right; we're not the enemy of the people but major news outlets are doing plenty to erode public confidence in the news without any help from Mr. Trump. Welcome to another example of the left's inconsistency on race. If the goal is a postracial America, why does racial identity continue to be liberalism's overriding obsession? Why is racism viewed as something to redirect rather than end outright? If you're situated on the progressive left, racist views are OK to harbor so long as they're targeted at the right groups for the proper reasons? More[62] Witness: Trump Tower Meeting Was 'Boring' Policy Presentation[63] Aaron Klein Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  NEW YORK   A Russian businessman who was present at the infamous, brief meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016 has provided the most extensive publicly documented description yet about what allegedly transpired inside the room in which Russian nationals met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials. Irakly 'Ike' Kaveladze is senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development firm run by Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov, whose associate and son were both reportedly involved in setting up the Trump Tower meeting. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that was recently made public, Kaveladze related that no one at the meeting presented themselves there as representing the Russian government, no one discussed hacked emails and no conversation took place that could possibly be characterized as 'collusion' between Russia and the Trump campaign. In the testimony, reviewed in full by Breitbart News, Kaveladze asserted that the meeting was an informational presentation that focused largely the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials accused of involvement in the death of a Russian tax accountant. In his testimony, he further related how he called the meeting 'boring' when describing it afterwards. Kaveladze said that the senior Trump campaign officials present at the meeting   Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner   didn't seem interested in any of the information discussed. He described Kushner as being 'very frustrated' that he was wasting his time at the meeting and Manafort as busy on his phone and not even paying attention during the presentation. 'And at some point of time, Mr. Kushner asked a question,' recalled Kaveladze, who does not seem to speak fluent English. 'I can't give you word by word, but I think the idea was: 'Why are we here and why are we listening to that Magnitsky Act story?'' Kaveladze also described Trump Jr. as politely ending the meeting by telling participants that 'we're in the middle of electoral campaign' and 'we're extremely busy right now.'

Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said special counsel Robert Mueller would 'love' it if his investigation into Russian election meddling during the 2016 presidential election goes past September and affects the 2018 midterm elections. Gohmert said, 'When I hear that Giuliani is saying, 'Oh, if it goes past\u00a0September 1, Mueller will be blamed for you know, playing politics and affecting the election,' Mueller could care less, he would love to affect the election.' He continued, 'This is a guy who sat down, looked Trump in the face and said, basically begging him to appoint him again as director of the FBI. And when he doesn't get it, he becomes special counsel of an area he is totally disqualified from because he was FBI director in part of the investigation into Russia trying to buy uranium that enabled Hillary to get CFIUS to approve the sale so they could make $145 million. Mueller should be investigated, but instead, he is the special counsel. This is a guy that doesn't care. He is hoping he will affect the election and screw over the president.' He added, 'Looking at it from Mueller's standpoint, okay, he times this 90 days before the election and says we want to ask questions knowing that they will probably come back with conditions he can't accept. He will have to do a subpoena. And even if the president does agree to testify, then he gets him in a perjury trap which will help him indict.'

The separation of 1700 votes, or less than one percent, highlights the recent attempt by Democratic activists to fight efforts to prevent voter fraud from occurring. For the past four years, George Soros has spent millions of dollars trying to weaken Ohio's election security by funding efforts to both block its implementation of Voter ID and prevent the state from removing inaccurate registrations. Soros pledged $5 million[75] to fund Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias's efforts to fight voter ID laws in Ohio and two other states ahead of the 2016 election. Elias would file that suit in Ohio on behalf of several groups, including the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, that would have an employee sentenced to prison[76] for voter fraud. In 2016, liberal activist groups Demos and the ACLU filed suit against the state of Ohio in an attempt to stop its efforts to remove inaccurate voter registrations from its rolls. Soros gave 1.25 million to Demos in 2016, on top of the more than $3 million he had given in previous years. And Soros has been even more generous with the ACLU, giving over $35 million[77] for Trump related lawsuits. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ohio's efforts in a 5-4 decision earlier this year. But even with voter ID and cleansed voter rolls, there are still problems with Ohio elections. Consider that 170 registered voters listed as being over 116 years[78] old still existed on the rolls of Ohio's 12th Congressional when GAI accessed the data last August. That's 10 percent of Balderson's current margin of victory, pending provisional ballots. And 72 voters over the age of 116 who 'live' in Balderson's district cast ballots in the 2016 election More[79] Exclusive-Eric Eggers: November Midterms 'Poised for a Tsunami of Voter Fraud'[80] Robert Kraychik Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  The Government Accountability Institute's (GAI) Eric Eggers, author of Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election[81], warned of a potential 'tsunami of voter fraud' within November's forthcoming midterm elections during a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. Eggers pointed to narrow electoral margins of victory in Tuesday's elections[82]\u00a0as evidence of vulnerability to the threat of voter fraud. Eggers noted how voter fraud had been documented[83] in numbers large enough to swing presidential elections. He pointed to the volume of 'double-votes' GAI identified among Florida residents via a study of voter rolls from 2016's presidential election. Eggers said,\u00a0'[The GAI] performed a nationwide first-of-its-kind study to look at actual votes that were cast in the 106 election. We combined all the publicly available voter rolls that we could get, and we hired a data consultant and contracted with a commercial database and what we found was stunning. We found that in the state of Florida, in 2016, there were 2,100 double-votes that were cast. That means 2,100 times, somebody that lives in Florida cast a ballot, and then cast a second ballot in a different state. That's nearly four times what the margin of victory was in the presidential election in 2000.' Eggers added, 'These are the kinds of stakes that can absolutely swing an election.' Eggers explained how left-wing organizations funded by George Soros agitate against efforts to implement voter-ID laws and prevent double-voting by persons registered to vote in multiple states. Eggers stated, 'Organizations that are funded by George Soros both fight to keep those vulnerabilities in place, as in Ohio, by trying to prevent efforts to pass voter-ID laws or to make the voter rolls more secure; but then they also   and this is really the insidious part   they fund organizations that go out and round up voters, regardless of legality of their status, and force them through the vulnerabilities in the system.' Eggers continued, 'There are 248 counties in this country that have more registered voters than actual citizens of legal voting age. It's a problem because it creates opportunity for organizations like the formerly known ACORN and La Raza   they're all funded by Soros   to go and figure out where the vulnerabilities are and force the voters   whether they're legal or not   through the gaps.'

Rashida Tlaib won the Democratic Party nomination in the state's 13th Congressional District, setting her up to become the first Muslim congresswoman in U.S. history. Tlaib defeated five other candidates in the Democratic Party, but since no Republicans or third-party candidates ran for the seat vacated by former Democratic Rep. John Conyers, she will run unopposed, starting her term after the November election. Not surprisingly, Tlaib has been a vocal critic of President Trump, and was forcibly removed from a Detroit luncheon two years ago for heckling then-candidate Trump:\u00a0 Security officers and police removed 14 protesters, including former State Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, after they began shouting at Trump as he laid out his economic plan to the typically buttoned-down business crowd. All but one of the protesters was a member of the Michigan Peoples Campaign, a statewide activist group that advocates for economic and racial justice. [] Tlaib, who was the first Muslim woman in to serve in the Michigan Legislature, told the Free Press that\u00a0as a mother and a Muslim, she felt obligated to demand that Trump be a better example for children.

Step 1: Trump attacks on\u00a0Twitter. The president's relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un started out rocky, to say the least. Trump's Twitter outbursts left many worried that he could cause an international incident Step 2: Trump announces strict economic sanctions.\u00a0As Trump bashed Kim's leadership, he also worked to suffocate them financially by targeting China, which is one of North Korea's only economic partners Step 3: The meeting. Many critics of the president did not think the meeting between Trump and Kim would ever occur, but on June 12, the two met Step 4: Concessions.\u00a0Prior to the June 12 meeting, the president managed to negotiate the release[90] of U.S. prisoners.

Pelosi is set to become Speaker of the House if Democrats win next year, after losing the position when Republicans won the House in 2010. In her remarks, Pelosi opted against distinguishing between lawful and unlawful immigrants describing amnesty for illegal aliens as 'inevitable for America.' Partial transcript, PELOSI: if you ask people about their attitudes toward immigration and newcomers to the country, they might have one view But if they know one family, if they know one immigrant family, if they go to school with any immigrant children, or if their children go to school with any immigrant children, if they go to church with immigrants, they have a completely positive view. It changes everything But everything is about time, and we want to shorten the distance as your question indicated between what we think is inevitable for America. They think it is inconceivable, but we believe that we can get this done. We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican leadership in Congress. We believe that we will have leverage when we win in November. And why is that important? Because it gives leverage to every family, to every mom who courageously brought her child across the desert to escape   to escape death, rape, gang violence, and the rest. Because it gives hope, because of the leverage it gives to families who may have followed dad home for a family funeral and now can't come back into the country. As all of those injustices have to be corrected, there's a path and that path is greatly brightened by the knowledge that is in this community who sees firsthand simple solutions which make a big difference in people's lives. And so we're getting ready for this and it is only to come back to a place that honors our values, recognizes the importance of immigration to the success of America In February, Pelosi delivered a speech that lasted\u00a0more than eight hours[94] on the U.S.House floor, demanding a vote for amnesty for illegal aliens brought to the country as minors, who have been helped by the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program since 2012. (The program was canceled by the Trump administration last year, but remains active thanks to the courts.) In her address, Pelosi\u00a0described[95] illegal aliens as 'more American than Americans': 'Illegal immigrants are a blessing, they are doing what the Founding Fathers would wish,\u00a0they are the best of the best, more American than Americans, reinvigorating, they are fabulous, beautiful, and patriotic, yes, very patriotic,' The video and more[96] Man Claimed to Cross Border With His 'Daughter'   Now He's Facing Felony Charges for Raping Her[97] Sam Dorman Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Tuesday that a man is facing several felony charges after raping a girl he claimed was his daughter while attempting to enter from the southern border. Ramon Pedro, according to DHS, entered the United States in April with the girl, and stayed for several months until a hospital discovered that he wasn't really her father.\u00a0The girl's mother, as revealed after a July hospital visit for tuberculosis screening, sought to use her daughter to obtain a job and sent her to the United States with Pedro for that purpose. Police arrested Pedro on July 27, just one day after the hospital visit. He faces charges[98] for forcible sexual penetration, oral copulation, rape, and endangering/causing injury to a child.

Feinstein 'Alarmed' That Kavanaugh Documents Are Being Withheld From Democrats[100] Bailey Vogt Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a letter Wednesday that she is 'alarmed' that documents regarding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are being withheld from Democrats by the National Archives. CNN obtained a letter[101]\u00a0to archivist David Ferriero in which Feinstein, who is also the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, put the Archives on blast for denying Democrats 'materials necessary to fulfill their constitutional duty' of inputting on Kavanaugh's nomination, Trump's choice to replace[102] Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. 'Under your overly restrictive reading of the Presidential Records Act, minority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee now have no greater right to Mr. Kavanaugh's records than members of the press and the public,' Feinstein wrote in her letter. 'I ask that you reconsider the position set forth in your August 2 letter. These records are crucially important to the Senate's understanding of Mr. Kavanaugh's full record, and withholding them prevents the minority from satisfying its constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on his nomination.' This controversy was sparked when\u00a0looking to learn more about Brett Kavanaugh's three years[103] as staff secretary in the George W. Bush administration. The National Archives responded to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's (D-N.Y.) request for the documents with a denial, saying that the documents were not allowed to be accessed unless Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), submitted\u00a0the request. The odds of Grassley doing that is slim, as many Republicans have said Democrats are using this documents request to delay a nomination they would not vote for anyway More[104] Ocasio-Cortez Fails to Say How She'll Pay for Socialism   Alludes to Math as 'Conservative Talking Point'[105] Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  Democratic socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), continues to struggle to describe her plan on how to pay for all of her socialist policies.\u00a0Ocasio-Cortez has many noble pursuits\u00a0listed on her platform[106], including tuition-free higher education, free housing, and Medicare\u00a0for all.

The State Department Press Briefing was posted by the Department of Defense videos. The pertinent exchange is from 5:59 to 10:54. Link to Defense Department video[129] A reporter asked this loaded question: '..given the amount of public opposition to this and the amount of concern on Capitol Hill that's been raised, is the Secretary planning to do anything to stop these downloads from becoming available, as they would at 12:01?' From Acting Under Secretary of State and Spokesperson, Heather Nauert[130]: I think we need to put some things in perspective. This is obviously a heated situation; a lot of people have interest in this story. A lot of people have been ignoring this fact for quite some time since this story began: At least since the year 2013, these CAD files, these computer - assisted design files, have been available online, they've been legal for U.S. citizens to actually download these CAD designs for quite some time now. They've been able to get these designs and print out these 3D guns in the United States.\u00a0 The reason that the State Department got involved, our only equity in this, is because of our role in controlling foreign access to U.S. defense technology. In simpler words, the State Department wants to prevent the wrong people from acquiring weapons overseas. That is the State Department's equity in this.  This has obviously gone through a legal process. The Department of Justice was advising the State Department on this entire legal matter. The Department of Justice suggested that the State Department and the U.S. Government settle this case, and so that is what was done.\u00a0We were informed that we would've lost this case in court, or would have likely lost this case in court based on First Amendment grounds.\u00a0We took the advice of the Department of Justice, and here we are right now These facts are not in dispute. Yet we have a judge in federal court issuing restraining orders to prevent the publication of these files on the grounds that they must do so to prevent the potential for 'irreparable harm'.  From seattletimes.com[131]: 'During the Tuesday hearing in Seattle, Eric Soskin, a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department, said they reached the settlement to allow Defense Distributed to post the material online because the regulations were designed to restrict weapons that could be used in war, and the online guns were no different from the weapons that could be bought in a store. Since the weapons 'did not create a military advantage,' he told Lasnik, 'how could the government justify regulating the data?' But the judge countered, 'There is a possibility of irreparable harm because of the way these guns can be made.'' Remember, these files have been available, and legal to print, for five years.

Canada -Fahad Hussain, the Danforth killer's brother, has a long criminal history involving both drugs and guns. By court order, he lived with his family friend Maisum Ansari, his bail surety. Fahad and Ansari had 42 kilograms of Carfentanil and 33 guns in the basement of Ansari's home. Thirty of those guns were a single model of Glock pistol, still in their boxes. Despite media reports, these are not small-time drug dealers. Indeed, Fahad Hussain dealt drugs, but he and Ansari seemingly had much bigger plans. Plans the government doesn't want to talk about. We're only safe because Ansari's upstairs tenant called the fire department to complain about a carbon monoxide alarm. When firefighters arrived, they discovered a huge cache of drugs and guns in the basement and called police. Carfentanil: Before being discovered by drug dealers, Carfentanil was viewed (and used) as a chemical weapon. A dose of just 20 micro-grams, smaller than a poppy seed, is fatal to humans. With 1 billion micro-grams per kilogram (yes, Billion) it translates into 50 million fatal doses per kilogram. Police seized 42 kilograms of Carfentanil, or 2.1 BILLION fatal doses, from the basement of Ansari's home, the same home Fahad Hussain was removed from when he overdosed on a combination of cocaine, heroin and an unnamed substance. What drug dealer can sell 2.1 billion doses of any drug, let alone one as lethal as Carfentanil? What drug dealer ties up that kind of cash - approximately $100,000,000.00 (One hundred million dollars) - when they can order smaller amounts with far less financial risk?

And the government does not want to talk about this terrorist plot. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is on record saying the Danforth killer was not known to his ministry. That's possible, but very unlikely. With a brother in possession of enough poison to kill the entire country dozens of times over, the odds of the Danforth killer NOT being on federal radar are pretty small. When contacted about the Carfentanil seizure and its potential lethality, the Ministry of Public Safety chose not to comment More[138] Australia strips citizenship from Islamic State supporters[139] Excellent idea Dave Rod McGuirk Associated Press August 8, 2018 CANBERRA, Australia - Five former dual nationals have been stripped of their Australian citizenship due to their involvement with the Islamic State group overseas, a government minister said Thursday. A total of six people have now lost their Australian citizenship since the law was changed in 2015 to enable dual nationals to lose their citizenship rights for actions contrary to their allegiance to Australia, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said.

According to court documents filed by prosecutors, Wahhaj was training the children to carry out school shootings. Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Wahhaj without bond for felony child abuse. He is also the subject of an extradition warrant from Georgia on charges of kidnapping his own son from the state in December. </p><p>His son was not among the starving children rescued from the compound. There are fears the remains[2] of an as-yet unidentified child found at the compound could be Wahhaj's son. Prosecutors said[3] on Wednesday that Wahhaj and four accomplices possessed an AR-15 rifle and four pistols with ample ammunition and were training the children to commit school shootings.  Wahhaj's father, who was born under the name Jeffrey Kearse but now also uses the name 'Siraj Wahhaj,' is an imam in New York who was an unindicted co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He served as a character witness in the trial of mastermind Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, also known as the 'Blind Sheikh.' The New York Post reported[4] on Monday that the elder Wahhaj is currently the head of the Majid at-Taqwa mosque in Bedford-Stuyvesant. The other defendants in the compound case are the younger Siraj Wahhaj's wife, his two sisters, and his brother-in-law. The Post quoted a January Facebook post from the elder Wahhaj that implied his son, the other co-conspirators, and a total of 12 of his grandchildren had gone missing and were 'traveling together.'  The 11 living children rescued from the compound, plus the child's remains that were recovered, would add up to 12 kids. The missing boy, named Abdul-Ghani, was 3 years old at the time his mother said her husband Siraj Wahhaj abducted him from Georgia; Monday marked his fourth birthday.  The warrant filed in Georgia stated[5] that Wahhaj planned to perform an 'exorcism' on the boy, who suffered from hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, had chronic seizures, and was unable to walk on his own More[6] Democrat Darling Linda Sarsour Praises Imam Siraj Wahhaj \u2014 Radical Islamist Linked to World Trade Center Bombing and Father of NM Terrorist[7] Jim Hoft Gateway Pundit August 8, 2018  Muslim Siraj Ibn Wahhaj was arrested last week at a compound in New Mexico. Wahhaj was training children to commit mass shootings at US schools. Siraj ibn Wahhaj is the son of a Brooklyn imam[8] who was named as a possible co-conspirator in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Liberal leader Linda Sarsour is a huge fan of Imam Wahhaj despite his terrorist past.

Notice that de Blasio didn't accuse Fox News of purveying fake news He accused FNC of providing a different narrative from the Democrat-controlled Mainstream Media's De Blasio would obviously prefer a state-controlled media, and a Democrat-controlled state Dave Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, told interviewers that the United States of America would be a 'more unified country' without Fox News. De Blasio told The Guardian's[14] Ben Jacobs that Fox News founder, Rupert Murdoch, is entirely responsible for President Donald Trump taking office. The mayor directly pointed to Murdoch's company, News Corp, the parent company[15] to many media outlets including the Wall Street Journal and Fox. 'If you could remove News Corp from the last 25 years of American history, we would be in an entirely different place,' said de Blasio. De Blasio specifically condemned Murdoch's companies for adding to the conversation and causing division between Americans. '[Without News Corp] we would be a more unified country. We would not be suffering a lot of the negativity and divisiveness we're going through right now,' said de Blasio. 'I can't ignore that.' Some conservatives found this statement to be bold, especially coming from a man who strikes division so often. De Blasio has unnecessarilyadded to division many times.  For example, in 2016, de Blasio picked a war[16] against Chick-Fil-A because their owner is a Christian who believes in traditional marriage More[17] WaPo Uses Soros-Funded Group to Attack GAI Voter Fraud Expos on Day of Book Launch[18] De Blasio would much rather have all news media behave like the Washington Post Dave Eric Eggers Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  What passes for 'journalism' today? Washington Post reporter Eli Rosenberg contacted my organization, the Government Accountability Institute, at midnight to comment on an incendiary piece[19] challenging our groundbreaking work on voter fraud. For some strange reason, we were unavailable at that time. He then promptly published the story at 5:45 a.m., noting that 'GAI declined to comment on Tuesday morning.' His actions eliminate even the most charitable interpretations of anything resembling journalistic fairness. His article is a hit piece posing as a news article. He's clearly doing the bidding of left-wing activists who are concerned by our data-driven research that demonstrates real evidence of the threat of voter fraud Rosenberg cites these activists as 'experts' to say voter fraud is not a problem. Who are these 'disinterested' experts? The Post cites Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap as an authority. Dunlap served on President Trump's Advisory Commission on Election Integrity and last week released documents he claimed showed no evidence of widespread voter fraud. Case closed? Hardly. First, the story fails to identify Dunlap as a progressive Democrat. It doesn't mention that Dunlap was accused by other commission members of leaking internal documents to friendly press associates who then favorably reported leaked emails, sometimes within the hour. The article further fails to mention that. Fellow commission member J. Christian Adams, a former Department of Justice Civil Rights attorney and president of the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation, said Dunlap[20] was actively sabotaging the commission More[21] The Facebook Distraction[22] A study shows that it was a tussle between new and old media that shaped the race. Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  A study[23] last year of the 2016 election by six scholars affiliated with Harvard's Berkman Klein Center got virtually zero play, and it's not hard to understand why. It found that social media 'engagement' that shaped the election outcome overwhelmingly was sparked by the traditional profit-seeking, left-tilting national media, plus new-style, right-wing outlets like Breitbart\u2014and not by fake news sites or Russian bots. 'The 'fake news' framing of what happened in the 2016 campaign ... is a distraction,' says the study. The real difference maker in 2016 was the rise of highly propagandistic, dissenting, right-wing media, but the authors are far from certain that its arrival should be considered an 'attack on democracy, rather than its expression.' What little press coverage the study got focused on its account of Breitbart's success in 'shopping' the Clinton Foundation story to the mainstream media. 'If Donald Trump's support had been limited to readers of Breitbart, he would never have won the electoral college,' the authors say. But isn't this virtually the ideal in a test tube? Dissenting new media force mainstream outlets to notice a story, but also to vet it? By now you may be thinking of Facebook[24] 's Rob Goldman, who was pilloried for a tweet that criticized press accounts of Russia's Facebook activities that 'align with the main media narrative of Tump [sic] and the election.' You may be thinking of Mark Zuckerberg's statement, before he was forced to recant, that it was 'silly' to imagine Facebook affecting the election outcome. The Harvard study amounts to a comprehensive debunking of a hysterical BuzzFeed report that unfortunately remains influential. The news site claimed that, during the last three months of the campaign, the top 20 election stories from 'hoax sites and hyperpartisan blogs' outperformed the top 20 stories from legitimate sites in terms of Facebook engagement. The problem here should be apparent. Dozens of news sites would have covered the same legitimate stories, but their 'engagement' wasn't measured, as it should have been to compare the traction gained by specific real vs. specific fake stories.  As a separate study[25] in the Columbia Journalism Review also notes, 'engagement' with fake news often has more to do with its 'entertainment value' than its believability. Dartmouth College's Brendan Nyhan, another debunker of the fake-news hysteria, points out[26] what anybody in charge of spending ad dollars already knows: People just aren't that influenceable. Even if fake news were as effective as TV advertising, concludes[27] yet another careful study, 'the fake news in our database would have changed vote shares by an amount on the order of hundredths of a percentage point.'

David Gale The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  How about if we ALL leave the island? Dave After 18 years as an executive at MTV, I decided to start a media brand for an underserved audience: American military veterans and their families.  We Are the Mighty[53], which launched in 2014, has intentionally stayed away from hard news, politics or anything that tries to polarize veterans. Because our entire purpose is to engage this audience, we rely heavily on social media, especially our Facebook page[54]. At first we found, as many publishers have, that there was no better partner than Facebook[55] , the company whose mission statement is 'to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together ... and express what matters to them.' Despite Facebook's frequent and inscrutable changes, our business continued to thrive. We were rewarded\u2014with likes, shares and comments\u2014for our authentic posts, positive message and high engagement. Thanks to Facebook's enormous scale, we could reach a monthly audience of millions. If we stayed true to our values and remained assiduously nonpolitical, positive and honest, we assumed we could withstand the inevitable tweaks to the algorithm. Then in June, Facebook said it had changed its policies 'in response to criticism over how its ad network was able to be manipulated during elections.' These policies require publishers to label anything considered 'political' or 'issue-based advertising.' Evidently, if anything in our posts uses the word 'military,' we are classified as a 'political' advertiser\u2014as seen on Facebook's Advertiser Help Center[56] in its list of 'National Issues of Public Importance'\u2014and must be labeled as such. Publishers like We Are the Mighty must register as creators of 'political advertising' to target audiences with such content. Casting such a wide net has a profound effect on a company whose objective is to provide vets with a space free of politics. These men and women joined the military to defend the Constitution and America, not a political party or agenda. Facebook's position that all content relating to our community be labeled 'political advertising' is antithetical to the very nature of their solemn oath to this country More[57] Ann Coulter: Sarah Jeong Better Drive Carefully![58] Ann Coulter Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  If you're worried about the social media monopolies censoring speech, just be happy they can't put you in prison. Federal prosecutors are celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Charlottesville, Virginia, 'Unite the Right' rally \u2014 isn't this the 'paper' anniversary? \u2014 by indicting James Fields for 'hate.' Fields has already been charged with murder in state court. (I would think that 'hate' would be subsumed by a murder charge.) But the federal 'hate crimes' statute allows the feds to skirt the Constitution's ban on double jeopardy \u2014 at least for certain kinds of 'hate.' \u2014 The stabbing of Yankel Rosenbaum by assailants yelling 'Get the Jew!': NOT a federal hate crime. \u2014 The brutal kidnapping and murder of a young white couple in Knoxville, Tennessee, by black youths: NOT a federal hate crime. \u2014 The torture of a mentally disabled kid in Chicago, by assailants saying 'F\u2014 white people!' and 'F\u2014 Trump!': NOT a federal hate crime. (Curiously, none of the attackers was Sarah Jeong.) \u2014 A white man killing a white woman by driving into a crowd of left-wing protesters: THAT'S a federal hate crime. To make their case, prosecutors did a deep dive into Fields' social media postings to prove that, yes, while he might have killed a white woman in this particular case, he's still a racist. The second paragraph of the indictment states: 'Prior to August 12, 2017, Defendant JAMES ALEX FIELDS JR. obtained multiple social media accounts, which he used to express his beliefs regarding race, national origin, religion and other topics. On these accounts, FIELDS expressed and promoted his belief that white people are superior to other races and peoples; expressed support of the social and racial policies of Adolf Hitler and Nazi-era Germany, including the Holocaust; and espoused violence against African Americans, Jewish people and members of other racial, ethnic and religious groups he perceived to be non-white. FIELDS also expressed these views directly in interactions with individuals known to him.' GUILTY! Wait \u2014 what? Again, Fields is a white man charged with murdering a white woman. This is a prosecution of Fields for Bad Thought, utterly oblivious to not only the Constitution's double jeopardy clause, but the free speech clause and also simple common sense. It's like a parody of what serious people feared about criminalizing 'hate.' Contrary to common belief on college campuses, there is no 'hate speech' exception to the First Amendment. Pimply teenaged boys writing snotty remarks about blacks and Jews is every bit as constitutionally protected as an Asian girl on The New York Times' editorial board writing snotty things about white men, although the latter pays better More[59] Is Liberal Racism a Horse of a Different Color?[60] Bigotry is bigotry, whether systemic, as at Harvard, or idiosyncratic, like Sarah Jeong's Twitter feed.  Jason L. Riley The Wall Street Journal Aug. 7, 2018  Be honest. Are you really surprised that the New York Times has stood by its decision to hire Sarah Jeong as an editorial board member even after it was revealed she spent years on social media making openly racist and sexist remarks about white men? You may be outraged, sure. But surprised? To paraphrase a well-known political figure, Ms. Jeong could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot a white person without losing the support of liberals. It's a safe bet she was tapped by the Times because of these racial prejudices, not despite them. Editorial board members are hired to help formulate and express the official position of a newspaper. Ms. Jeong is being hired to speak for the Times, and they like where she's coming from. The Grey Lady attacks President Trump as a racist and sexist on a near-daily basis, and columnists like Charles Blow write about little else. So is it hypocritical for the paper to hire and defend a new editorial board member who has made no secret of her own biases? Of course it is, but that's considered beside the point by people who share Ms. Jeong's worldview. The liberals who control most major media outlets specialize in applying different standards to different groups. Like the Times, Twitter[61] had no problem with Ms. Jeong's repugnant observations. Scores of tweets that included offensive phrases\u2014'#cancelwhitepeople'; 'are White people genetically disposed to burn faster in the sun?'; 'White people have stopped breeding. you'll all go extinct soon. that was my plan all along'\u2014didn't faze Jack Dorsey's content monitors. But when conservative activist Candace Owens decided last weekend to reproduce Ms. Jeong's posts and replace 'white' with 'black' or 'Jewish,' Twitter temporarily suspended her account. Following a backlash, Twitter restored the account and claimed that 'we made an error.' Of course, the Times can hire whomever it pleases. But if it's going to give the likes of Ms. Jeong a pass while lecturing us about growing intolerance on the political right, how seriously should readers take the paper's nonstop Trump-is-a-bigot coverage? The president's attacks on the media are often misguided and overstated\u2014his daughter Ivanka is right; we're not the enemy of the people\u2014but major news outlets are doing plenty to erode public confidence in the news without any help from Mr. Trump. Welcome to another example of the left's inconsistency on race. If the goal is a postracial America, why does racial identity continue to be liberalism's overriding obsession? Why is racism viewed as something to redirect rather than end outright? If you're situated on the progressive left, racist views are OK to harbor so long as they're targeted at the right groups for the proper reasons? More[62] Witness: Trump Tower Meeting Was 'Boring' Policy Presentation[63] Aaron Klein Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  NEW YORK \u2014 A Russian businessman who was present at the infamous, brief meeting at Trump Tower on June 9, 2016 has provided the most extensive publicly documented description yet about what allegedly transpired inside the room in which Russian nationals met with Donald Trump Jr. and other campaign officials. Irakly 'Ike' Kaveladze is senior vice president at Crocus Group, the real estate development firm run by Russian oligarch Aras Agalarov, whose associate and son were both reportedly involved in setting up the Trump Tower meeting. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee that was recently made public, Kaveladze related that no one at the meeting presented themselves there as representing the Russian government, no one discussed hacked emails and no conversation took place that could possibly be characterized as 'collusion' between Russia and the Trump campaign. In the testimony, reviewed in full by Breitbart News, Kaveladze asserted that the meeting was an informational presentation that focused largely the Magnitsky Act, which sanctions Russian officials accused of involvement in the death of a Russian tax accountant. In his testimony, he further related how he called the meeting 'boring' when describing it afterwards. Kaveladze said that the senior Trump campaign officials present at the meeting \u2014 Paul Manafort, Donald Trump Jr. and Jared Kushner \u2014 didn't seem interested in any of the information discussed. He described Kushner as being 'very frustrated' that he was wasting his time at the meeting and Manafort as busy on his phone and not even paying attention during the presentation. 'And at some point of time, Mr. Kushner asked a question,' recalled Kaveladze, who does not seem to speak fluent English. 'I can't give you word by word, but I think the idea was: 'Why are we here and why are we listening to that Magnitsky Act story?'' Kaveladze also described Trump Jr. as politely ending the meeting by telling participants that 'we're in the middle of electoral campaign' and 'we're extremely busy right now.'

Louie Gohmert (R-TX) said special counsel Robert Mueller would 'love' it if his investigation into Russian election meddling during the 2016 presidential election goes past September and affects the 2018 midterm elections. Gohmert said, 'When I hear that Giuliani is saying, 'Oh, if it goes pastSeptember 1, Mueller will be blamed for you know, playing politics and affecting the election,' Mueller could care less, he would love to affect the election.' He continued, 'This is a guy who sat down, looked Trump in the face and said, basically begging him to appoint him again as director of the FBI. And when he doesn't get it, he becomes special counsel of an area he is totally disqualified from because he was FBI director in part of the investigation into Russia trying to buy uranium that enabled Hillary to get CFIUS to approve the sale so they could make $145 million. Mueller should be investigated, but instead, he is the special counsel. This is a guy that doesn't care. He is hoping he will affect the election and screw over the president.' He added, 'Looking at it from Mueller's standpoint, okay, he times this 90 days before the election and says we want to ask questions knowing that they will probably come back with conditions he can't accept. He will have to do a subpoena. And even if the president does agree to testify, then he gets him in a perjury trap which will help him indict.'

They say only 21 percent will vote . A holes really. \u2014 Deborah White (@GroovyTimes777) August 3, 2018[69] In a now-deleted response, Fonda suggested that parents take matters into their own hands: 'If you have a millennial in your family, take their early ballots, fill them out and mail them in, or take the ballot to the voting place and give it to the officials no more worrying!'

The separation of 1700 votes, or less than one percent, highlights the recent attempt by Democratic activists to fight efforts to prevent voter fraud from occurring. For the past four years, George Soros has spent millions of dollars trying to weaken Ohio's election security by funding efforts to both block its implementation of Voter ID and prevent the state from removing inaccurate registrations. Soros pledged $5 million[75] to fund Clinton campaign attorney Marc Elias's efforts to fight voter ID laws in Ohio and two other states ahead of the 2016 election. Elias would file that suit in Ohio on behalf of several groups, including the Ohio Organizing Collaborative, that would have an employee sentenced to prison[76] for voter fraud. In 2016, liberal activist groups Demos and the ACLU filed suit against the state of Ohio in an attempt to stop its efforts to remove inaccurate voter registrations from its rolls. Soros gave 1.25 million to Demos in 2016, on top of the more than $3 million he had given in previous years. And Soros has been even more generous with the ACLU, giving over $35 million[77] for Trump related lawsuits. Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Ohio's efforts in a 5-4 decision earlier this year. But even with voter ID and cleansed voter rolls, there are still problems with Ohio elections. Consider that 170 registered voters listed as being over 116 years[78] old still existed on the rolls of Ohio's 12th Congressional when GAI accessed the data last August. That's 10 percent of Balderson's current margin of victory, pending provisional ballots. And 72 voters over the age of 116 who 'live' in Balderson's district cast ballots in the 2016 election More[79] Exclusive-Eric Eggers: November Midterms 'Poised for a Tsunami of Voter Fraud'[80] Robert Kraychik Breitbart News 8 Aug 2018  The Government Accountability Institute's (GAI) Eric Eggers, author of Fraud: How the Left Plans to Steal the Next Election[81], warned of a potential 'tsunami of voter fraud' within November's forthcoming midterm elections during a Tuesday interview on SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight with Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Rebecca Mansour. Eggers pointed to narrow electoral margins of victory in Tuesday's elections[82]as evidence of vulnerability to the threat of voter fraud. Eggers noted how voter fraud had been documented[83] in numbers large enough to swing presidential elections. He pointed to the volume of 'double-votes' GAI identified among Florida residents via a study of voter rolls from 2016's presidential election. Eggers said,'[The GAI] performed a nationwide first-of-its-kind study to look at actual votes that were cast in the 106 election. We combined all the publicly available voter rolls that we could get, and we hired a data consultant and contracted with a commercial database and what we found was stunning. We found that in the state of Florida, in 2016, there were 2,100 double-votes that were cast. That means 2,100 times, somebody that lives in Florida cast a ballot, and then cast a second ballot in a different state. That's nearly four times what the margin of victory was in the presidential election in 2000.' Eggers added, 'These are the kinds of stakes that can absolutely swing an election.' Eggers explained how left-wing organizations funded by George Soros agitate against efforts to implement voter-ID laws and prevent double-voting by persons registered to vote in multiple states. Eggers stated, 'Organizations that are funded by George Soros both fight to keep those vulnerabilities in place, as in Ohio, by trying to prevent efforts to pass voter-ID laws or to make the voter rolls more secure; but then they also \u2014 and this is really the insidious part \u2014 they fund organizations that go out and round up voters, regardless of legality of their status, and force them through the vulnerabilities in the system.' Eggers continued, 'There are 248 counties in this country that have more registered voters than actual citizens of legal voting age. It's a problem because it creates opportunity for organizations like the formerly known ACORN and La Raza \u2014 they're all funded by Soros \u2014 to go and figure out where the vulnerabilities are and force the voters \u2014 whether they're legal or not \u2014 through the gaps.'

Rashida Tlaib won the Democratic Party nomination in the state's 13th Congressional District, setting her up to become the first Muslim congresswoman in U.S. history. Tlaib defeated five other candidates in the Democratic Party, but since no Republicans or third-party candidates ran for the seat vacated by former Democratic Rep. John Conyers, she will run unopposed, starting her term after the November election. Not surprisingly, Tlaib has been a vocal critic of President Trump, and was forcibly removed from a Detroit luncheon two years ago for heckling then-candidate Trump: Security officers and police removed 14 protesters, including former State Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Detroit, after they began shouting at Trump as he laid out his economic plan to the typically buttoned-down business crowd. All but one of the protesters was a member of the Michigan Peoples Campaign, a statewide activist group that advocates for economic and racial justice. [] Tlaib, who was the first Muslim woman in to serve in the Michigan Legislature, told the Free Press thatas a mother and a Muslim, she felt obligated to demand that Trump be a better example for children. 'We need to be heard you cannot stay silent,' Tlaib said Monday.'He doesn't love Detroit.He doesn't love no one who isn't Donald Trump.'

North Korean Repeat? Trump Blasted Iranian President \u2015 Now Rouhani Wants to Talk[89] Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Aug 6, 2018  President Donald Trump seems to have a playbook for dealing with hostile internationalleaders\u2014 and it looks like he is about to use the same strategy with Iran as he did with North Korea. Step 1: Trump attacks onTwitter. The president's relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un started out rocky, to say the least. Trump's Twitter outbursts left many worried that he could cause an international incident Step 2: Trump announces strict economic sanctions.As Trump bashed Kim's leadership, he also worked to suffocate them financially by targeting China, which is one of North Korea's only economic partners Step 3: The meeting. Many critics of the president did not think the meeting between Trump and Kim would ever occur, but on June 12, the two met Step 4: Concessions.Prior to the June 12 meeting, the president managed to negotiate the release[90] of U.S. prisoners. During the meeting, Trump also negotiated the return of the remains[91] of U.S. soldiersand a reduction in North Korea's nuclear activity.

Pelosi is set to become Speaker of the House if Democrats win next year, after losing the position when Republicans won the House in 2010. In her remarks, Pelosi opted against distinguishing between lawful and unlawful immigrants describing amnesty for illegal aliens as 'inevitable for America.' Partial transcript, PELOSI: if you ask people about their attitudes toward immigration and newcomers to the country, they might have one view But if they know one family, if they know one immigrant family, if they go to school with any immigrant children, or if their children go to school with any immigrant children, if they go to church with immigrants, they have a completely positive view. It changes everything But everything is about time, and we want to shorten the distance as your question indicated between what we think is inevitable for America. They think it is inconceivable, but we believe that we can get this done. We are not going to be able to get it done under the Republican leadership in Congress. We believe that we will have leverage when we win in November. And why is that important? Because it gives leverage to every family, to every mom who courageously brought her child across the desert to escape \u2014 to escape death, rape, gang violence, and the rest. Because it gives hope, because of the leverage it gives to families who may have followed dad home for a family funeral and now can't come back into the country. As all of those injustices have to be corrected, there's a path and that path is greatly brightened by the knowledge that is in this community who sees firsthand simple solutions which make a big difference in people's lives. And so we're getting ready for this and it is only to come back to a place that honors our values, recognizes the importance of immigration to the success of America In February, Pelosi delivered a speech that lastedmore than eight hours[94] on the U.S. House floor, demanding a vote for amnesty for illegal aliens brought to the country as minors, who have been helped by the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program since 2012. (The program was canceled by the Trump administration last year, but remains active thanks to the courts.) In her address, Pelosidescribed[95] illegal aliens as 'more American than Americans': 'Illegal immigrants are a blessing, they are doing what the Founding Fathers would wish,they are the best of the best, more American than Americans, reinvigorating, they are fabulous, beautiful, and patriotic, yes, very patriotic,' The video and more[96] Man Claimed to Cross Border With His 'Daughter' \u2014 Now He's Facing Felony Charges for Raping Her[97] Sam Dorman Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Tuesday that a man is facing several felony charges after raping a girl he claimed was his daughter while attempting to enter from the southern border. Ramon Pedro, according to DHS, entered the United States in April with the girl, and stayed for several months until a hospital discovered that he wasn't really her father.The girl's mother, as revealed after a July hospital visit for tuberculosis screening, sought to use her daughter to obtain a job and sent her to the United States with Pedro for that purpose. Police arrested Pedro on July 27, just one day after the hospital visit. He faces charges[98] for forcible sexual penetration, oral copulation, rape, and endangering/causing injury to a child. The news came as President Donald Trump's administration faced continual scrutiny for separating immigrant families at the southern border More[99] Sen. Feinstein 'Alarmed' That Kavanaugh Documents Are Being Withheld From Democrats[100] Bailey Vogt Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said in a letter Wednesday that she is 'alarmed' that documents regarding Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are being withheld from Democrats by the National Archives. CNN obtained a letter[101]to archivist David Ferriero in which Feinstein, who is also the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, put the Archives on blast for denying Democrats 'materials necessary to fulfill their constitutional duty' of inputting on Kavanaugh's nomination, Trump's choice to replace[102] Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court. 'Under your overly restrictive reading of the Presidential Records Act, minority members of the Senate Judiciary Committee now have no greater right to Mr. Kavanaugh's records than members of the press and the public,' Feinstein wrote in her letter. 'I ask that you reconsider the position set forth in your August 2 letter. These records are crucially important to the Senate's understanding of Mr. Kavanaugh's full record, and withholding them prevents the minority from satisfying its constitutional obligation to provide advice and consent on his nomination.' This controversy was sparked whenlooking to learn more about Brett Kavanaugh's three years[103] as staff secretary in the George W. Bush administration. The National Archives responded to Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer's (D-N.Y.) request for the documents with a denial, saying that the documents were not allowed to be accessed unless Judiciary Committee chairman, Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), submittedthe request. The odds of Grassley doing that is slim, as many Republicans have said Democrats are using this documents request to delay a nomination they would not vote for anyway More[104] Ocasio-Cortez Fails to Say How She'll Pay for Socialism \u2014 Alludes to Math as 'Conservative Talking Point'[105] Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  Democratic socialist, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), continues to struggle to describe her plan on how to pay for all of her socialist policies.Ocasio-Cortez has many noble pursuitslisted on her platform[106], including tuition-free higher education, free housing, and Medicarefor all. Her only problem is that Medicare for all, alone, costs $32 trillion[107]. Unfortunately, Ocasio-Cortez[108] and her supporters[109] fail to answer the basic question: How will you pay for that?  Previously, she told Comedy Central's, Trevor Noah, that she could raise trillions by just getting rich people to 'pay their fair share.' Ocasio-Cortez stated that she sat down with a Nobel Prize-winning economist and he said a higher tax rate could bring in $2 trillion over 10 years. 'The Daily Show' host @Trevornoah[110] asked Socialist congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@Ocasio2018[111]) how she plans to pay for her agenda. It really is hard to watch. pic.twitter.com/OGiPAArlce[112] \u2014 The Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) July 27, 2018[113]; Ocasio-Cortez also proposed a carbon tax and cutting the $700 billion militarybudget[114], neither of which would cover the costsof Medicare for all. The New York congressional candidate was offered a second attempt at explaining how she would pay for her policies during an interview with Pod Save America. This time, she just dodged the question altogether. 'But how are you going to pay for it?'@Ocasio2018[115] responds: pic.twitter.com/tRvqkXYfIN[116] \u2014 Pod Save America (@PodSaveAmerica) August 7, 2018[117]; They say 'how are you going to pay for it' as though they haven't used these same ways to pay for unlimited wars, to pay for trillion dollar tax cuts and tax cut extensions. They use these mechanisms all the time. They only want to know it just seems like their pockets are only empty when we're talking about human capitalin the United States: education, healthcare, housing and investing in the middle class. All of the sudden, you know, there's nothing left. All the sudden, the wealthiest nation in the world, we're just totally scarce. Her response, which states that Americans only pay for tax cuts and wars, is misleading[118]. Over half of the country's mandatory and discretionaryspending goes toward Social Security and Health and Human Services. Ocasio-Cortez went on to blame Democrats for not getting on board with the policies of DemocraticSocialism.'I legitimatelythink they start to buy into conservative talking points. They get dragged into their courts all the time,' said Ocasio-Cortez.By right-wing talking points, she means math The video and more[119] Students Singled out and Lectured over Their NRA Shirts \u2014 Then Kicked out of Class[120] Madison Summers Independent Journal Review Aug 8, 2018  Two high schools students were targeted, lectured, and kicked out of class by their teacher for wearing National Rifle Association (NRA) shirts to school. The sophomores atLodi High School in California were lectured about why guns are bad, CBS Sacramento[121] reported. One of the students was sent to the principal's office for refusing to remove the NRA[122] shirt. Charlene Craig said her 15-year-old daughter, who was one of the students lectured, was 'attacked' in class and was told she would have to write an essay if she disagreed with the teacher. 'I think he's there to teach,' Craig said of the teacher. 'I don't think he's there to discuss his personal beliefs.'

Fox 29 reports[125] that at least on suspect walked up the car and began shooting.Camden County Police Chief J. Scott Thomson described the suspect as a 'male' who shot 'between 10 and 25 roundsat the officers.' One of the officers was able to return fire, but Thomson said it is unclear whether the suspect was hit.Both officers were wounded in the ambush attack but are expected to live. Ironically, the ambush occurred onNational Night Out, which is held to increase the bond between police officers and the communities they serve. New Jersey has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. NRA Carry Guard reports[126] that a 'permit to purchase' is required before a handgun can acquired for home defense and a concealed carry license can only be acquired by those who convince the state they have 'justifiable need' to carry a gun.

She answered questions about the settlement of the First Amendment lawsuit with the Second Amendment Foundation and Defense Distributed. The State Department Press Briefing was posted by the Department of Defense videos. The pertinent exchange is from 5:59 to 10:54. Link to Defense Department video[129] A reporter asked this loaded question: '..given the amount of public opposition to this and the amount of concern on Capitol Hill that's been raised, is the Secretary planning to do anything to stop these downloads from becoming available, as they would at 12:01?' From Acting Under Secretary of State and Spokesperson, Heather Nauert[130]: I think we need to put some things in perspective. This is obviously a heated situation; a lot of people have interest in this story. A lot of people have been ignoring this fact for quite some time since this story began: At least since the year 2013, these CAD files, these computer - assisted design files, have been available online, they've been legal for U.S. citizens to actually download these CAD designs for quite some time now. They've been able to get these designs and print out these 3D guns in the United States. The reason that the State Department got involved, our only equity in this, is because of our role in controlling foreign access to U.S. defense technology. In simpler words, the State Department wants to prevent the wrong people from acquiring weapons overseas. That is the State Department's equity in this.  This has obviously gone through a legal process. The Department of Justice was advising the State Department on this entire legal matter. The Department of Justice suggested that the State Department and the U.S. Government settle this case, and so that is what was done.We were informed that we would've lost this case in court, or would have likely lost this case in court based on First Amendment grounds.We took the advice of the Department of Justice, and here we are right now These facts are not in dispute. Yet we have a judge in federal court issuing restraining orders to prevent the publication of these files on the grounds that they must do so to prevent the potential for 'irreparable harm'.  From seattletimes.com[131]: 'During the Tuesday hearing in Seattle, Eric Soskin, a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department, said they reached the settlement to allow Defense Distributed to post the material online because the regulations were designed to restrict weapons that could be used in war, and the online guns were no different from the weapons that could be bought in a store. Since the weapons 'did not create a military advantage,' he told Lasnik, 'how could the government justify regulating the data?' But the judge countered, 'There is a possibility of irreparable harm because of the way these guns can be made.'' Remember, these files have been available, and legal to print, for five years.

Armed school staff are now a well-worn reality.The FASTER program[135]teaches school staff to stop a threat and to treat the injured. That program has been in place for the last five years and has trained over a thousand teachers. These first responders have many days of instruction.

Canada -Fahad Hussain, the Danforth killer's brother, has a long criminal history involving both drugs and guns. By court order, he lived with his family friend Maisum Ansari, his bail surety. Fahad and Ansari had 42 kilograms of Carfentanil and 33 guns in the basement of Ansari's home. Thirty of those guns were a single model of Glock pistol, still in their boxes. Despite media reports, these are not small-time drug dealers. Indeed, Fahad Hussain dealt drugs, but he and Ansari seemingly had much bigger plans. Plans the government doesn't want to talk about. We're only safe because Ansari's upstairs tenant called the fire department to complain about a carbon monoxide alarm. When firefighters arrived, they discovered a huge cache of drugs and guns in the basement and called police. Carfentanil: Before being discovered by drug dealers, Carfentanil was viewed (and used) as a chemical weapon. A dose of just 20 micro-grams, smaller than a poppy seed, is fatal to humans. With 1 billion micro-grams per kilogram (yes, Billion) it translates into 50 million fatal doses per kilogram. Police seized 42 kilograms of Carfentanil, or 2.1 BILLION fatal doses, from the basement of Ansari's home, the same home Fahad Hussain was removed from when he overdosed on a combination of cocaine, heroin and an unnamed substance. What drug dealer can sell 2.1 billion doses of any drug, let alone one as lethal as Carfentanil? What drug dealer ties up that kind of cash - approximately $100,000,000.00 (One hundred million dollars) - when they can order smaller amounts with far less financial risk? They don't There is another story at play here - the elephant in the room - a story the government does not want to talk about. A story with a nightmare ending were it not for a drug overdose and a carbon monoxide alarm. Hussain and Ansari possessed enough poison to kill the entire Greater Toronto Area (GTA) 328 times over, or enough to kill the entire population of Canada 58 times. And the government does not want to talk about this terrorist plot. Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale is on record saying the Danforth killer was not known to his ministry. That's possible, but very unlikely. With a brother in possession of enough poison to kill the entire country dozens of times over, the odds of the Danforth killer NOT being on federal radar are pretty small. When contacted about the Carfentanil seizure and its potential lethality, the Ministry of Public Safety chose not to comment More[138] Australia strips citizenship from Islamic State supporters[139] Excellent idea Dave Rod McGuirk Associated Press August 8, 2018 CANBERRA, Australia - Five former dual nationals have been stripped of their Australian citizenship due to their involvement with the Islamic State group overseas, a government minister said Thursday.

Bush and Donald Trump He did not mention that 9/11 had been 5 years in the planning[2]which meant that it started during the Clinton years Nor did he say anything about the 1993 bombing of the Twin Towers[3]which again took place during the Clinton years Nor did he mention the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salam[4], Tanzaniathe 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi[5], Kenyanor the 2000 USS Cole bombing[6], the Khobar Towers attackall of which took place during the Clinton years Hmmmm Could it be because Clinton didn't strike back in a meaningful way? Dave Laura Widener American Military News September 12, 2018  Seventeen years after Al Qaeda carried out the deadliest terror attack in history, the group is urging for more attacks on the U.S. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiriappeared in a video on the anniversary of 9/11 on Tuesday to urge Muslim followers across the globe to wage more terror attacks against the United States, Newsweek reported[7] Tuesday. 'Seventeen years have passed since Bush launched his Crusader war against Muslims, a war linkedwith the historical enmity directed towards Islam from its dawn to this very day,' the terror leader said. </p><p>On anniversary of #September11th[8], #alQaeda[9] releases speech by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri entitled, 'How to Confront America,' taking a big-picture focus of the global jihadist movement, stressing the 'duty of jihad,' ...entifying America as 'the number one enemy of Muslims.' pic.twitter.com/mYgqwvfcab[10] \u2014 Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) September 11, 2018[11] Al-Zawahiri,an Egyptian doctor, took over leadership of Al Qaeda after the 2011 death of Osama bin Laden. In the 30-minute video, titled 'How Do We Face America?' al-Zawahiri referred to the U.S. as a religious enemy of Islam, citing President Trump's Dec. 2017 decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the close U.S.-Israel relationship as proof. He also criticized the U.S. for fighting against Islam throughout the Middle East, and some parts of Asia and Africa. 'Behind all the conflicts involving Muslims,one finds either the direct hand of the secular crusader West in the leadership of America, or its silent approval, connivance, collusion, or intrigues.

AP Interview: Adviser says Iran failed detained US resident[15] Jon Gambrell Associated Press September 14, 2018 TEHRAN, Iran - A top adviser to Iran's president on human rights said that the government 'failed' to help a U.S. permanent resident imprisoned over spying allegations that she herself invited to the country for a summit. In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Shahindokht Molaverdi acknowledged the limits a civilian government faces when challenging the actions of the judiciary in the Islamic Republic, especially when dealing with cases involving the imprisonment of foreigners and activists. She cited the case of Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese-born internet freedom advocate living in the U.S., who she invited to a conference in September 2015. The hard-line Revolutionary Guard later arrested Zakka on his way to the airport, and he was later sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges in a closed-door trial before a Revolutionary Court. 'This is in no way approved by the government,' Molaverdi said. 'We did all we could to stop this from happening, but we are seeing that we have failed to make a significant impact.' Molaverdi is an outspoken official within the government of elected President Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate cleric within Iran's Shiite theocracy. In Rouhani's first term, she served as his vice president for women and family affairs, and in his second term become his special assistant on citizenship rights. Political analysts within Iran saw Molaverdi's reassignment as Rouhani responding to hard-liners' criticism of her comments on women's rights and other issues. She's condemned police overreach in dealing with women loosely wearing their mandatory headscarves and demanded access for women to sporting events. She gave an interview in 2016 in which she said all the men in a single, unnamed village in Iran's eastern Sistan and Baluchistan province had been executed for drug offenses. More[16] Iran nuclear chief threatens Israel with 'consequences'[17] AP and World Israel News Staff September 12, 2018 Iran's nuclear chief said Tuesday he hopes Tehran's atomic deal with world powers will survive President Donald Trump withdrawing the US from it. He also threatened that the Islamic Republic's program stands ready to build advanced centrifuges and further enrich uranium. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Ali Akbar Salehi stressed that Iran would be guided by 'prudence and wisdom' when weighing whether to abandon the deal if European nations fail to protect it from Trump. The US withdrawal from the deal already has badly shaken Iran's anemic economy[18], crashing its currency, the rial. That likely will be compounded by US sanctions coming in November that threaten Iran's oil exports, a major source of government funding. Salehi dismissed out of hand the idea of caving to American demands to renegotiate the accord[19]. 'Yes, we have our problems. Yes, the sanctions have caused some problems for us. But if a nation decides to enjoy political independence, it will have to pay the price,' Salehi said. 'If Iran decided today to go back to what it was before, the lackey of the United States,' the situation would be different. A string of bombings, blamed on Israel, targeted a number of scientists beginning in 2010 at the height of Western concerns over Iran's program. Israel never claimed responsibility for the attacks, though Israeli officials have boasted in the past about the reach of the country's intelligence services. 'I hope that they will not commit a similar mistake again because the consequences would be, I think, harsh,' Salehi warned More[20] Iran's Shaky Foundations[21] Shoshana Bryen American Thinker September 13, 2018 Current U.S. 5th Fleet exercises[22] designed to ensure freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea are a welcome sight. The Islamic Republic of Iran has spent years extending its claims across the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. It hassponsoredwars and militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen plus terror organizations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, along withfarther-flung activities in Africa and South America. That, plus its huffing and puffing, have made the mullahs look ten feet tall. Iran claims to have designed and built a new jet fighter plane[23]. It claims security control of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz[24] and threatens to block oil exports from other countries if Iran is constrained by sanctions. Iran has ordered the U.S. Navy out of the Gulf. It announced a military pact[25] with Syria that it claims will give it access to all of Syrian territory. But the regime is on shaky ground. The 'jet fighter plane' in the Iranian video is a 1950s-era American F-5F. The United States Navy is in, and will remain in, the Gulf, and, in fact, the last Iranian harassment[26] of U.S. Navy ships was in mid-2017, after the Navy received orders to respond to unsafe Iranian activity around American ships. The military pact appears mainly a way for Iran to try to recoup its multibillion-dollar losses in Syria by claiming contracts for reconstruction when the war ends. It isn't clear who the Iranians think will actually pay for reconstruction. And, pact or no pact, Israel is maintaining red lines preventing an Iranian military buildup. Israel has acknowledged some 200 raids[27] into Syria. Internally, the country faces social and religious rebellion, drought and water mismanagement, and economic instability. This is partially related to the government's exorbitant expenditures on revolution and terror abroad; it is also related to the increased ability of the Iranian people to know what is outside their borders. All of this makes the Islamic Republic more, not less, dangerous. The Iranian government understood it would receive a windfall from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the 'Iran deal'). It received billions in cash, plus Western investment as sanctions were lifted. But more money simply meant more for weapons and a Shiite mercenary army in Syria; more for Hezb'allah and Hamas; more for the Shiite militias in Iraq[28]; more agents plotting terror[29] in Europe and the U.S.[30] Now the cash is gone, and the promise of Western investment is going. Facing the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S. administration, Total, Maersk, Peugeot, GE, Honeywell, Boeing, Lukoil, Reliance, Dover, and Siemens \u2014 among others \u2014 have left[31] or announced they will leave. The expenses, however, remain. Syria costs $15-20 billion annually[32], more than Iran's budget deficit of $9.3 billion last year. Prof. Steve Hanke[33] of Johns Hopkins University measured Iran's annual inflation rate in late August at 191 percent and rising. Iran is, in fact, a poor and angry country. And a dry one. Iran faces a terrible combination of drought and water mismanagement. An Atlantic Council report[34] noted that over 90% of Iran's water is used in agriculture but 'the sector's efficiency rate was 35%' while the global efficiency rate is 75%. The problem is exacerbated by irrigating during the day[35] and the failure of the government to repair water infrastructure. There are reports of cities without water or taps that run brown. Iranian authorities admitted that at least 13 people were injured[36] in water protests in Khorramshahr. Technology could help, but Iran can't/won't use the best water technology out there \u2014 Israel's.

As the U.N. envoy for Yemen tried to get negotiations back on track, Yemeni forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday said they had cut off the main road between the capital San'a and Hodeidah, the Red Sea port that serves as the main gateway for humanitarian aid entering the country. Officials said they took the step because the Iran-backed Houthi rebels failed to turn up last week in Geneva for what was supposed to be the first U.N.-brokered negotiations on Yemen in two years. 'This escalation comes in response to their rejection of participation in the Geneva peace talks,' said Mamoon al-Mahgami, a spokesman for the Yemeni force, the Giant Brigades. The renewed push to seize the Red Sea port city came as the Trump administration rebuffed congressional attempts to curtail American support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In a special report required by Congress, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two Gulf nations were doing enough to address widespread concerns about coalition airstrikes in Yemen that the U.N. says have been responsible for most of the civilian deaths and injuries over the past three years. Mr. Pompeo said Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. were making moves to reduce civilian casualties, push the peace process forward and ensure humanitarian aid gets into the country. The decision allows the U.S. to continue providing the coalition with limited intelligence and to carry out aerial refueling of warplanes launching airstrikes in Yemen. In the unclassified report, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pompeo conceded that 'civilian casualties have occurred at rates that are far too high in the Saudi-led coalition's campaign in Yemen.' 'Recent civilian casualty incidents indicate insufficient implementation of reforms and targeting practices,' the report stated. 'Investigations have not yielded accountability measures.'

Ambassador Haley has made it clear that the United States will not be a doormat for the U.N. Under her leadership, the United States pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council[43], defended Israel[44] and the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem,[45] and cut funding[46] to nations that disrespect America or its values. Despite her personal successes within the U.N., Haley gave the credit to Trump and his entire administration during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier [President Trump] has actually done a lot in foreignpolicy, but in different ways. If you look at what he's done with North Korea, I mean it's really led the international community to isolate North Korea to where they decide, you know, they have a decision to make. He led on the fact that he pulled out of the Iran deal. It's forcing the entire world to admit the fact that Iran was not behaving properly. He's led in Syria to make sure that chemical weapons aren't being used and he's warned against them being used again. I think if you look at the western hemisphere, whichwe've spent the last two weeks focused on, whether it is Venezuela or Nicaragua, the messages are being sent that we're not going to support dictators. Haley explained that a lot of Trump's foreign policy successes stem from his ability to follow through with his demands if expectations are not met. 'We are no longer going to give money to people who are against the U.S. or say 'death to America,' or do anything that would be anti-U.S.,' Haley stated, adding, 'We are now going to strategically start to work with our friends and we are no longer going to be handouts for those that go against us.'

Malkin's analysis came in response to Wednesday's leaked video[49] of a Google 'all-hands meeting' days after 2016's presidential election.During the meeting, Google's co-founder Sergey Brin suggested that President Donald Trump's supporters voted for him out of 'boredom', which he further credited as a historical driver of both fascism and communism. Malkin said, 'One last angle I want to get in here and it's something that Breitbart's education reporters have covered is Google's role in infiltrating the public schools. When they talk about boredom[50], what do they think is the cure? Well, stuffing our kids' minds and larding up their computers, which are donated by Google and all of these big tech companies into the classrooms with GAFE[51], which is Google Applications for Education Why? Not because they care about boredom or not, but they're tracking our kids. Who cares about tracking hijackers and jihadists? They're spending more money and building more infrastructure to track our kids from the time they get onto the bus until they graduate from college. That's what they're focused on.' Malkin spoke of Google's relationship with Democrats and the Obama administration: 'Google had free reign under the Obama White House, that's how the FERPA[52] \u2014 Family Education Rights and Privacy Act \u2014 was completely weakened to allow the third-party sale of our kids' data, and more needs to be done on that front. I'd like to see the Trump Education Department be doing more to combat that As part of the supposed repeal of Common Core, of course, it is the infiltration and the tentacles of the likes of Google and Microsoft and all of these Silicon Valley firms into the public schools which has gone unabated.' Google intends to leverage its knowledge and infrastructure to condition children into compliance with its vision, warned Malkin. 'It's not just searches,' said Malkin. 'It's not just curricula.

Malkin's comments came against the backdrop of Wednesday's publishing of a leaked video[56] from 2016 depicting Google's leadership lamenting the election of President Donald Trump and pledging global political opposition to both nationalism and populism. 'These companies cannot be treated as just any run-of-the-mill small business,' said Malkin. 'Not only because of their market cap, but because of their complete domination of the spaces by which most people in America in the 21st century are able to exercise their political free speech. That's how so much of my own social media and new media entrepreneur career has been possible I want to ensure that for the next generation that they still have platforms left if Google and Facebook and Twitter are left untouched. I'm not just talking about the Democrats, but I'm also talking about a lot of big business Republicans that are more interested in getting donations from these corporations than holding the line and holding them accountable.' Mansour remarked, 'They will shut us all down. They're going through us one by one.' Malkin responded, 'I've been shadowbanned for about a year and a half, and that is confirmed.

This is Orwellian. It's alarming.'

So did Russian trolls. '8 years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Millions of Americans have gained access to health care. Thank you, Mr. President!' said a tweet linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company engaged in an online influence campaign that typically seeks to pit one side against the other on controversial issues. A newly identified group of nearly 10,000 tweets shows that while Russian trolls often focus on such hot-button issues as Hillary Clinton's email or athletes kneeling during the national anthem, they also target substantive and divisive policy areas like health care. How Russian Trolls Collected Americans' Personal Information: Nearly 600 IRA-linked accounts posted to Twitter[60] about the ACA and health policy from 2014 through this past May, with the most prolific ones tweeting hundreds of times, the new data show. One account, called TEN_GOP, rocketed from fewer than 1,000 followers to more than 138,000 in two years, sending 60 tweets that potentially reached followers more than four million times. Researchers at Clemson University provided The Wall Street Journal with the set of about 9,800 tweets involving health policy and the ACA that the IRA posted over that period. An analysis by the Journal found that 80% of the tweets had conservative-leaning political messages, often disparaging the health law. The accounts have been shut down by Twitter as congressional investigators unearthed their origin, but intelligence experts say the assault is continuing through similar accounts and channels.

Gordon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 12, 2018  Twitter[65] Inc. shut down the account of a prominent Iraqi militia leader after he was accused by the U.S. government of inciting violence against American diplomats in Basra, where the U.S. consulate came under a rocket attack. The episode illustrates the importance that social media has come to play in mobilizing political support in Iraq\u2014and, potentially, in encouraging militia attacks. It comes as Iraqi politicians are struggling to form a new government and the U.S. and Iran are vying for influence. A U.S. official said Twitter's decision Tuesday to block the account of Abu Mehdi al-Mohandis, the head of a Shiite militia group that has long been backed by Iran, was made after U.S. authorities raised concerns. Saturday's rocket attack missed the U.S. consulate in Basra and nobody was hurt. 'We brought it to their attention,' said State Dept. spokeswoman Heather Nauert. 'They understood the threat and took action.' Mr. Mohandis's supporters have complained about Twitter's action, saying it came with the encouragement of foreign interests. A spokesman for Twitter said the social-media company doesn't comment on actions concerning individual accounts for privacy and security reasons. Analysis cited by the company indicates that more than 90% of terrorist accounts are removed by Twitter based on its own monitoring efforts. Mr. Mohandis has long been a considered a notorious figure by Washington, although he has led some of the Shiite militia forces that have fought militants from Islamic State in recent years.The U.S. has designated him as a terrorist[66] and has accused him of participating in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in the 1980s. During the Iraq war, Mr. Mohandis was involved in Tehran's effort to arm and train Iraqi Shiite militias that attacked U.S. and other allied troops, U.S. officials say. Mr. Mohandis's cooperation with Iran emerged in recently declassified interrogation reports[67] of another Shiite leader, Qais al-Khazali, who was captured by the U.S.-led coalition a decade ago and accused of organizing a botched kidnapping of five U.S. soldiers in 2007 that led to their deaths.Mr. Khazali told interrogators that Mr. Mohandis was so close to the Iranians at the time that he probably didn't even own a house in Iraq. It was Mr. Mohandis's Saturday statements blaming the U.S. for the turmoil in Basra that prompted the Americans to approach Twitter about his messages. Still, the move won't preclude him from making comments through other media, such as television More[68] Iraq: Car bomb explosion kills at least 6 north of Baghdad[69].

Ironically, under two years later, it was revealed that Google has been working on a censored search engine for China in cooperation with the Chinese government. According to reports[72], the search engine, which has been in development since Spring 2017, 'will blacklist access to certain websites and restrict search terms related to human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest.' Employees working on the project were also ordered[73] by Google to 'keep quiet about it,' and 'deflect questions.' Following the revelation, over a dozen human rights groups condemned[74] Google for the project and urged the company to reconsider, while Google employees themselves started to fear[75] human rights violations as a result of the censored search engine. Despite a willingness to work with the Chinese government, with Google also working[76] on an artificial intelligence research center in the country, Google announced[77]in June that they would no longer work with the U.S. government. In July, Rep.Lamar Smith (R-TX), who serves as chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, described[78] Google's willingness to work with China but not the United States as 'awfully close to being un-American.' 'For the management of Google to be rolled so easily by their employees and not stand up for principle, not say we need to help everybody, and not defend helping the military who after all defends us every day of the year, was again an example of bias that we don't need,' he declared The video and more[79] Revolving Door: Dozens of Clinton Staffers Hired by Google \u2014 and Vice-Versa[80] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 13 Sep 2018  Dozens of people who used to work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and a number of Clinton initiatives went on to work at Google, and vice-versa.

Brent Bozell III Fox News September 13, 2018 Google, owned by the same parent company as YouTube, is arguably the most influential social media company in the world, with a power to affect the public dialogue across the globe in ways unimaginable just a handful of years ago. The question is now being asked: Is Google flexing its muscles to do just that? Conservatives have pointed to mounting evidence that Google is waging war on them. They'll cite everything from YouTube banishing conservatives for espousing their beliefs, to Google partnering with left-wing organizations to disparage conservative thought itself. All along, Google has issued bizarre, barely understandable statements denying these charges. Now Google executives have been caught again - twice in the past two weeks. Actually, they have indicted themselves with explosive leaks of their own material. And it goes to the very top of the corporate food chain. Breitbart has released an explosive video of an hour-long post-election Google meeting featuring staff and top executives discussing their despair over the election of President Trump in 2016. There's a reason the video has a 'Confidential - Internal Use Only' label on top. It's about the last thing that company wanted the public to see. The video features Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening the meeting by declaring: 'I think it's a very stressful time. It conflicts with many of our values voting is not a rational act.' In one fell swoop he both endorsed Hillary Clinton and disparaged the Trump voters who Clinton referred to as 'deplorables.' The video features Google Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker dismissing the election results as 'a hiccup' interrupting the march of the left. Walker says: 'What are the next steps for us before the world comes into this environment of tribalism that's self-destructive (in) the long term?

According to Avlon, if the United States continues to ignore climate science, 'the cost of lives and dollars will escalate.' 'On the same day Trump was discussing [Hurricane] Florence, his EPA proposed rolling back restrictions on emissions of methane. That's just the latest environmental policy targeted by the Trump administration,' Avlon stated. He went on to note how two Harvard scientists claimed[97] Trump's policies and getting the country out of the Paris Climate Agreement could lead to 80,000 deaths every decade. 'It is so bad according to two Harvard scientists said it could lead to 80,000 unnecessary deaths every decade,' said Avlon. 'Warmer water means more intense storms. When President Trump called Hurricane Florence tremendously wet, he was actually on to something.' He later concluded, 'This isn't rocket science, folks, it's climate science.And as long as we continue to aggressively ignore it, the cost in lives and dollars will escalate.

Al Green is all rhetoricHe presents no facts about Trump when making his case for impeachment Dave Tony Lee Breitbart News 13 Sep 2018  Rep. Al Green (D-TX) explained on Thursday that he owes it to 'unborn generations' to impeach President Donald Trump. Green, who has insisted that Trump does not have to commit a crime to get impeached, told the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference that 'bigotry in this country is the number one problem facing a good many Americans, many of whom are of African ancestry.' He said bigotry must be combated 'with an agenda.' 'I will bring Articles of Impeachment once we have a new Congress,' Green said. 'If no one else does, I will do it because I owe it to unborn generations to do what I can to take on this challenge.' Green said it is his responsibility 'to make sure that everyone goes on record because history is going to judge us all this is a moment in time when the world is watching and we ought not let bigotry of this magnitude go unchecked.' In response to people who ask him why he does not wait to push impeachment, Green said, 'Dr. King didn't wait.' The Texas Democrat said Martin Luther King went back to the Edmund Pettus Bridge after Bloody Sunday even though he knew 'invidious discrimination' would not end that day.

Host Stephen Colbert asked,'Chuck Schumer was willing to trade President Trump the wall for the DREAM Act. Would you take that deal?' O'Rourke responded, 'No, I wouldn't.' O'Rourke then pointed to border security legislation he worked on with Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX). He added, 'We don't need walls. We can have smart security solutions, and we can free DREAMers from the fear of deportation by making them US citizens today, so they can contribute to their maximum capacity, to their full potential.'

In an interview with SiriusXM's Breitbart News Tonight, Coulter asked, 'What's it going to take?' for the U.S. to temporarilyhalt immigration to the country. 'I mean, what's it going to take? Even 17 years of celebrating diversity day and we're admitting, as I know from Breitbart, admitting more Muslims from the countries where the 9/11 hijackers came from, than we were before 9/11,' Coulter said. 'What kind of country does this?' Coulter said Trumpshould stick to his 'America First' plan on immigration, as that was the central issue of the 2016 presidential election and continues to be the key focus of GOP midterm voters. 'So build the wall, [implement a] nice little immigration moratorium and I think things will be fine,' Coulter said As Breitbart News[113] reported, in the past 17 years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more than 195,000 foreign nationals have been imported to the U.S. from countries whence the terrorist hijackers arrived The audio and more[114] Court: Ex-terror defendant facing deportation is US citizen[115] The solution is easy: Take away Khalid's citizenship This should be an obvious penalty for any naturalized citizenwho is caught engaging in terrorist activity Dave Larry Neumeister Associated Press September 13, 2018 NEW YORK - A one-time Maryland high school honors student who admitted aiding Muslim extremists overseas and helped the U.S. pursue terrorists after his 2011 arrest is a U.S. citizen, a federal appeals panel said Thursday as it erased a pending deportation order. The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan means 24-year-old Mohammad Hassan Khalid can continue his studies at a Maryland college. His Philadelphia lawyer, Wayne Sachs, called the decision a 'very satisfying victory for a well-deserving young man with a bright future.' He said the three-judge appeals panel, unlike four earlier courts, 'properly focused on the law rather than the petitioner's 'notoriety.'' The U.S. government did not immediately say if it planned to appeal. Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote that he cannot congratulate Khalid, given that he 'plotted sneaking violence against Americans.' 'He cooperated with the authorities only when, having been caught, he found himself needing another kind of refuge,' Jacobs said More[116] FEMA Targets Fake Florence News, Highlights 7 Examples of Media Hurricane Mistakes[117] Just found a new way Hurricane Florence is being used to attack President Trump Dave Penny Starr Breitbart News 13 Sep 2018  The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has a portion of its website devoted[118] to Hurricane Florence \u2014 now a Category 1 storm off the coast of the Carolinas \u2014 including a roundup of seven fake news stories that are swirling around in the media. Listed under the 'Hurricane Florence Rumor Control' heading, the rumors include that FEMA diverted almost $10 million to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pay for detention and deportation efforts along the U.S. border with Mexico. Breitbart News reported[119] on that fake news cycle, which started with a Democratic Senator giving documents to MSNBC and continuing as other news outlets picked up the inaccurate story: 'Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) gave documents to MSNBChe said proved the Trump administration transferred almost $10 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), just as the eastern United States faces Hurricane Florence hitting land in the next few days. MSNBC's Rachel Maddow reported[120]that claim on Tuesday and the story was picked up by many other left-wing media outlets as fact, even as a spokesman from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \u2014 the agency over FEMA \u2014 said the report was inaccurate.' 'Under no circumstances was any disaster relief funding transferred from @fema[121] to immigration enforcement efforts. This is a sorry attempt to push a false agenda at a time when the administration is focused on assisting millions on the East Coast facing a catastrophic disaster,' DHS Spokesman Tyler Houlton said on Twitter on Tuesday. 'The money in question \u2014 transferred to ICE from FEMA's routine operating expenses \u2014 could not have been used for hurricane response due to appropriation limitations. DHS/FEMA stand fiscally and operationally ready to support current and future response and recovery needs,' Houlton tweeted. On its website, FEMA addresses the money transfer rumor: 'Funding was diverted from FEMA's operational budgets for travel, training, public engagement and information technology. The amount diverted is less than 1 percent of FEMA's annual operating budget.'

Wade time, meaning before abortion was legal in the United States. Clinton said, 'I look at my children and I have to quote Jim Yong Kim, 'optimism is a moral choice.' Every day I make the moral choice to be optimistic. That my efforts and my energies, particularly when I'm fortunate enough to be in partnership with kinda fellow travelers, hopefully will make a difference.' She added, 'And when I think about all of the statistics that are painful of what women are confronting today in our country, and what even more women confronted pre-Roe and how many women died and how many more women were maimed because of unsafe abortion practices, we just can't go back to that. Like that's unconscionable to me, and also, I'm sure that this will unleash another wave of hate in my direction, but as a deeply religious person, it's also unchristian to me.' The video[124] Feinstein's shameful Kavanaugh Hail Mary pass[125] Lauren DeBellis Appell Fox News September 13, 2018 Senator Dianne Feinstein asks the FBI to review letter involving Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh; reaction on 'The Story' to what the White House is calling a delay tactic. In an act of desperation designed to block Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court by smearing his reputation, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., hinted Thursday[126] that someone she would not name has made unspecified accusations about Kavanaugh that possibly might involve criminal conduct. Feinstein's Hail Mary pass came exactly one week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination of the highly qualified judge, who now sits on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Feinstein is leaving it to the media to fill in the facts about her vague and unsubstantiated claims about Kavanaugh, who was nominated by President Trump. She clearly is counting on Trump's many opponents in the media to help her keep the president's nominee off the Supreme Court - as they would seek to do for anyone nominated by Trump. Feinstein said in a statement: 'I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.' What the heck does that mean? (Translation: I got nothing). OK - Feinstein is claiming she knows something - but she's not saying what that mystery something is. How on Earth is anyone supposed to evaluate that? How would any of you reading this like someone to make a cryptic charge like the one Feinstein has thrown out about you, without presenting a shred of evidence? Fox News reported that two sources said Feinstein got a letter from Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., in July making the allegations against Kavanaugh - although the senator never spoke about it publicly before Thursday. That's the way Hail Mary passes work - you don't throw one until you're desperate and headed for a loss on the football field. The mystery letter wasn't even concerning enough for Feinstein to show to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The Intercept reported[127] the letter was sent by someone associated with Stanford University and involved a woman and Kavanaugh when she and the 53-year-old judge were both in high school The video and more[128] CANADA: GANG OF 'BURQA BANDITS' strikes again in an Ontario convenience store[129] BareNakedIslam September 13, 2018  Police in Ontario are looking for seven Muslims whom they believe teamed up to distract a convenience store employee while they robbed the store as well as stealing about $1,000 in cash.  CTV[130] (h/t Marvin W) Video camera surveillance shows five Muslim women in burqas and two bearded Muslim men enter the store. The men can be seen going straight to the front of the store and asking about lottery tickets while three of the five women can be seen heading to the back of the store. Two of the women can then be seen blocking the third woman from view as she sneaks into a back office.

The 32-year-old suspect, believed to be a local, sped towards a crowd of about 50 outside the bar at around 1am Friday local time, witnesses said. However, his white Peugeot ran into barriers set up for the town's annual grape-harvesting festival featuring bull-fighting which attracts thousands of people. Two people standing behind the barriers received slight injuries to their legs. After the crash the man tried to flee but was dragged to the ground by onlookers and 'roughed up' before police arrived.He was in a state of 'mental confusion' during his arrest and has been hospitalised, public prosecutor Eric Maurel said.

Prisons minister Rory Stewart said the 51-year-old, who inspired the killers of Lee Rigby and London[136] Bridge terrorist Khuram Butt, would be 'watched like a hawk' by police. The 51-year-old has served less than three years of a five-and-a-half-year sentence for inviting support for ISIS[137] and is currently in a special 'prison within a prison' at HMP Belmarsh. He spent five months inside before his trial took place which is part of the reason why his release next month has been triggered. Mr Stewart said he remained a 'destabilising influence' because he was part of a group of 'highly dangerous fanatical extremists' whose views cannot be changed and should be under surveillance. Speaking to the Evening Standard[138], Mr Stewart said: 'We have to put a very rich, full, MAPPA (multi agency public protection arrangements) wrap around them that includes everything going all the way up to MI5. That's GPS trackers, that's police, that's intelligence, watching every movement of their lives and restricting it incredibly closely because I'm in no doubt that these people are highly dangerous. Even if they are not themselves making bombs, they are a completely pernicious influence on the people they come into contact with and they need to be kept away from them.' He added: 'He [Choudary] is somebody that I would put into the category I have just mentioned \u2014 somebody who was not given a sentence of enormous length but somebody who is a genuinely dangerous person we will be watching him very, very carefully.'

The smugglers are heard asking each arriving migrant, reportedly from north Africa, to look into the camera before jumping off a boat and swimming to the Playa de Los Lances beach in the Cadiz province. A Spanish voice is heard giving the migrants instructions to 'wait' and 'look at the camera' as the young men jump into the water one at a time. Some of them are heard saying 'gracias' - 'thanks' - before leaping into the sea.  This video captures people smugglers filming the 'safe delivery' of illegal immigrants in Spain to ensure payment from their relatives. The footage is believed to be used by the smugglers as proof that the migrants have reached Spain. After showing it to relatives of the migrants, they are believed to receive the final instalment of a sum that is reportedly around \u20ac2,000 (1,784) per person Spain has become the main entry point for migrants arriving in Europe after Italy began closing its ports to rescue vessels. Over 33,000 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea and land so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.A further 313 have perished attempting the crossing. The area around the Straits of Gibraltar has long been a route for smuggling drugs and contraband tobacco. But recently, the Spanish Civil Guard have observed how the same criminal gangs have moved into people smuggling. A Civil Guard spokesperson said: 'There is a dangerous synergy of criminal activities, drug trafficking and mafias that are getting rich through the desperation of people illegally trying to reach Spanish territory.'

Speaking in the multicultural city of Malm\u00f6, where nearly half of residents are of foreign background, with Iraqis making up[145] the largest single group, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism said[146] Sweden is seen as 'a peaceful, generally prosperous country' with a relatively small gap between rich and poor. 'Spontaneously', reports[147] Norrk\u00f6pings Tidningar, the Dalai Lama then 'moved on to talk about one of the biggest issues in the Swedish election \u2014 the reception of refugees'. Noting that a large number of immigrants have settled in Europe from the Middle East and elsewhere, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual leader said it was good for nations to help 'a refugee really facing danger against their life'. 'Receive them, help them, educate them but ultimately they should develop their own country,' said[148] the 83-year-old Tibetan. 'I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,' he added, stressing that countries like Germany and Sweden should make clear that refugees must 'return to their homelands and rebuild them'.

The European Union's legislature voted overwhelmingly to label Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government a 'systemic threat to the rule of law.' The vote carries no immediate consequences, though it could theoretically lead to sanctions.  Mr. Orban is at the front of the two biggest challenges to the EU's authority: on migration and on the removal of domestic checks and balances. That has left Brussels in standoffs with more member states, especially in the south and east of the bloc, at a time when the EU is locked in a trade fight with Washington and seeking to avert a fresh crisis over Britain's exit from the bloc. On migration, Mr. Orban was a leader of European anti-immigrant policies, building a fence to keep out refugees and refusing to participate in an EU-wide relocation program for asylum seekers. His views have moved increasingly into the mainstream since the 2015 migration crisis. Mr. Orban has recently made common cause with Matteo Salvini, the popular Italian interior minister who leads the fiercely anti-immigration party, the League, in Italy's new government. But it is Mr. Orban's challenge to EU's rules governing democracy that was under scrutiny this week by lawmakers. His government has exerted control over the courts, media regulators and tax inspectors, building what he calls an 'illiberal state' that would emulate countries such as China and Russia. Czech and Polish leaders have spoken positively about that vision. European lawmakers on Wednesday voted to censure the Hungarian government, saying it is undermining European values. Mr. Orban has directed government contracts to his friends and political allies, who have in turn purchased most of the country's TV and radio stations, members of Parliament said. While the vote passed with a clear majority, some fear it could do little to restrain the Hungarian leader, who said the bloc was meddling in his country's internal affairs. Mr. Orban's government will now be labeled a threat to Europe's democratic order, the same charge the EU's executive has thrown at the Polish government over its overhaul of the judiciary. Any sanctions could see EU funding for the two countries slashed and possibly lead to both losing some voting rights at the EU level. However, the imposition of sanctions would require all other EU member states to agree, an unlikely prospect.  Mr. Orban, the first European head of government to endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign, has wide support from Europe's nativist leaders. On Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda denounced the EU for interfering in domestic affairs like Hungary's, calling the union an 'imaginary community.' Like many nationalist politicians on the rise in Europe, Mr. Orban cemented his power by attacking the EU for its alleged power grabs, particularly on migration policy. But unlike his Polish or Italian peers, Mr. Orban has kept close ties to center-right leaders in Europe, some of whom have warmed to his migration policies aiming to keep out asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere.

Bush and Donald Trump He did not mention that 9/11 had been 5 years in the planning[2]which meant that it started during the Clinton years Nor did he say anything about the 1993 bombing of the Twin Towers[3]which again took place during the Clinton years Nor did he mention the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Dar Es Salam[4], Tanzaniathe 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Nairobi[5], Kenyanor the 2000 USS Cole bombing[6], the Khobar Towers attackall of which took place during the Clinton years Hmmmm Could it be because Clinton didn't strike back in a meaningful way? Dave Laura Widener American Military News September 12, 2018  Seventeen years after Al Qaeda carried out the deadliest terror attack in history, the group is urging for more attacks on the U.S. Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri\u00a0appeared in a video on the anniversary of 9/11 on Tuesday to urge Muslim followers across the globe to wage more terror attacks against the United States, Newsweek reported[7] Tuesday. 'Seventeen years have passed since Bush launched his Crusader war against Muslims, a war linked\u00a0with the historical enmity directed towards Islam from its dawn to this very day,' the terror leader said. </p><p>On anniversary of #September11th[8], #alQaeda[9] releases speech by leader Ayman al-Zawahiri entitled, 'How to Confront America,' taking a big-picture focus of the global jihadist movement, stressing the 'duty of jihad,' identifying America as 'the number one enemy of Muslims.' pic.twitter.com/mYgqwvfcab[10]   Rita Katz (@Rita_Katz) September 11, 2018[11] Al-Zawahiri,\u00a0an Egyptian doctor, took over leadership of Al Qaeda after the 2011 death of Osama bin Laden. In the 30-minute video, titled 'How Do We Face America?' al-Zawahiri referred to the U.S. as a religious enemy of Islam, citing President Trump's Dec. 2017 decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, and the close U.S.-Israel relationship as proof. He also criticized the U.S. for fighting against Islam throughout the Middle East, and some parts of Asia and Africa. 'Behind all the conflicts involving Muslims,\u00a0one finds either the direct hand of the secular crusader West in the leadership of America, or its silent approval, connivance, collusion, or intrigues. It is basically a religious enmity, even if other shades of hostility overlap with it, whether economic greed, the desire to establish hegemony over geographic locations, and so on,' he said. 'America [is] the number one enemy of Muslims despite of its professed secularism,' al-Zawahiri said, according to[12] Times of Israel More[13] True peace is impossible in the Islamic worldYou can either have terrorist groups or terrorist statesor you can have both Dave Afghanistan attack: Nangarhar suicide blast toll soars[14]. A suicide bombing in east Afghanistan has killed at least 68 people, officials say, in one of the deadliest insurgent attacks in recent months. AP Interview: Adviser says Iran failed detained US resident[15] Jon Gambrell Associated Press September 14, 2018 TEHRAN, Iran - A top adviser to Iran's president on human rights said that the government 'failed' to help a U.S. permanent resident imprisoned over spying allegations that she herself invited to the country for a summit. In a wide-ranging interview with The Associated Press, Shahindokht Molaverdi acknowledged the limits a civilian government faces when challenging the actions of the judiciary in the Islamic Republic, especially when dealing with cases involving the imprisonment of foreigners and activists. She cited the case of Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese-born internet freedom advocate living in the U.S., who she invited to a conference in September 2015. The hard-line Revolutionary Guard later arrested Zakka on his way to the airport, and he was later sentenced to 10 years in prison on spying charges in a closed-door trial before a Revolutionary Court. 'This is in no way approved by the government,' Molaverdi said. 'We did all we could to stop this from happening, but we are seeing that we have failed to make a significant impact.' Molaverdi is an outspoken official within the government of elected President Hassan Rouhani, a relatively moderate cleric within Iran's Shiite theocracy. In Rouhani's first term, she served as his vice president for women and family affairs, and in his second term become his special assistant on citizenship rights. Political analysts within Iran saw Molaverdi's reassignment as Rouhani responding to hard-liners' criticism of her comments on women's rights and other issues. She's condemned police overreach in dealing with women loosely wearing their mandatory headscarves and demanded access for women to sporting events. She gave an interview in 2016 in which she said all the men in a single, unnamed village in Iran's eastern Sistan and Baluchistan province had been executed for drug offenses. More[16] Iran nuclear chief threatens Israel with 'consequences'[17] AP and World Israel News Staff September 12, 2018 Iran's nuclear chief said Tuesday he hopes Tehran's atomic deal with world powers will survive President Donald Trump withdrawing the US from it. He also threatened that the Islamic Republic's program stands ready to build advanced centrifuges and further enrich uranium. In an exclusive interview with The Associated Press, Ali Akbar Salehi stressed that Iran would be guided by 'prudence and wisdom' when weighing whether to abandon the deal if European nations fail to protect it from Trump. The US withdrawal from the deal already has badly shaken Iran's anemic economy[18], crashing its currency, the rial. That likely will be compounded by US sanctions coming in November that threaten Iran's oil exports, a major source of government funding. Salehi dismissed out of hand the idea of caving to American demands to renegotiate the accord[19]. 'Yes, we have our problems. Yes, the sanctions have caused some problems for us. But if a nation decides to enjoy political independence, it will have to pay the price,' Salehi said. 'If Iran decided today to go back to what it was before, the lackey of the United States,' the situation would be different. A string of bombings, blamed on Israel, targeted a number of scientists beginning in 2010 at the height of Western concerns over Iran's program. Israel never claimed responsibility for the attacks, though Israeli officials have boasted in the past about the reach of the country's intelligence services. 'I hope that they will not commit a similar mistake again because the consequences would be, I think, harsh,' Salehi warned More[20] Iran's Shaky Foundations[21] Shoshana Bryen American Thinker September 13, 2018 Current U.S. 5th Fleet exercises[22] designed to ensure freedom of navigation in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea are a welcome sight. The Islamic Republic of Iran has spent years extending its claims across the Middle East, the Persian Gulf, and the Red Sea. It has\u00a0sponsored\u00a0wars and militias in Iraq, Syria, Yemen plus terror organizations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, along with\u00a0farther-flung activities in Africa and South America. That, plus its huffing and puffing, have made the mullahs look ten feet tall. Iran claims to have designed and built a new jet fighter plane[23]. It claims security control of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz[24] and threatens to block oil exports from other countries if Iran is constrained by sanctions. Iran has ordered the U.S. Navy out of the Gulf. It announced a military pact[25] with Syria that it claims will give it access to all of Syrian territory. But the regime is on shaky ground. The 'jet fighter plane' in the Iranian video is a 1950s-era American F-5F. The United States Navy is in, and will remain in, the Gulf, and, in fact, the last Iranian harassment[26] of U.S. Navy ships was in mid-2017, after the Navy received orders to respond to unsafe Iranian activity around American ships. The military pact appears mainly a way for Iran to try to recoup its multibillion-dollar losses in Syria by claiming contracts for reconstruction when the war ends. It isn't clear who the Iranians think will actually pay for reconstruction. And, pact or no pact, Israel is maintaining red lines preventing an Iranian military buildup. Israel has acknowledged some 200 raids[27] into Syria. Internally, the country faces social and religious rebellion, drought and water mismanagement, and economic instability. This is partially related to the government's exorbitant expenditures on revolution and terror abroad; it is also related to the increased ability of the Iranian people to know what is outside their borders. All of this makes the Islamic Republic more, not less, dangerous. The Iranian government understood it would receive a windfall from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (the 'Iran deal'). It received billions in cash, plus Western investment as sanctions were lifted. But more money simply meant more for weapons and a Shiite mercenary army in Syria; more for Hezb'allah and Hamas; more for the Shiite militias in Iraq[28]; more agents plotting terror[29] in Europe and the U.S.[30]\u00a0 Now the cash is gone, and the promise of Western investment is going. Facing the re-imposition of sanctions by the U.S. administration, Total, Maersk, Peugeot, GE, Honeywell, Boeing, Lukoil, Reliance, Dover, and Siemens   among others   have left[31] or announced they will leave. The expenses, however, remain. Syria costs $15-20 billion annually[32], more than Iran's budget deficit of $9.3 billion last year. Prof. Steve Hanke[33] of Johns Hopkins University measured Iran's annual inflation rate in late August at 191 percent and rising. Iran is, in fact, a poor and angry country. And a dry one. Iran faces a terrible combination of drought and water mismanagement. An Atlantic Council report[34] noted that over 90% of Iran's water is used in agriculture but 'the sector's efficiency rate was 35%' while the global efficiency rate is 75%. The problem is exacerbated by irrigating during the day[35] and the failure of the government to repair water infrastructure. There are reports of cities without water or taps that run brown.

As the U.N. envoy for Yemen tried to get negotiations back on track, Yemeni forces backed by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday said they had cut off the main road between the capital San'a and Hodeidah, the Red Sea port that serves as the main gateway for humanitarian aid entering the country. Officials said they took the step because the Iran-backed Houthi rebels failed to turn up last week in Geneva for what was supposed to be the first U.N.-brokered negotiations on Yemen in two years. 'This escalation comes in response to their rejection of participation in the Geneva peace talks,' said Mamoon al-Mahgami, a spokesman for the Yemeni force, the Giant Brigades. The renewed push to seize the Red Sea port city came as the Trump administration rebuffed congressional attempts to curtail American support for the military campaign led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In a special report required by Congress, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two Gulf nations were doing enough to address widespread concerns about coalition airstrikes in Yemen that the U.N. says have been responsible for most of the civilian deaths and injuries over the past three years. Mr. Pompeo said Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. were making moves to reduce civilian casualties, push the peace process forward and ensure humanitarian aid gets into the country. The decision allows the U.S. to continue providing the coalition with limited intelligence and to carry out aerial refueling of warplanes launching airstrikes in Yemen. In the unclassified report, viewed by The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Pompeo conceded that 'civilian casualties have occurred at rates that are far too high in the Saudi-led coalition's campaign in Yemen.' 'Recent civilian casualty incidents indicate insufficient implementation of reforms and targeting practices,' the report stated. 'Investigations have not yielded accountability measures.' More[41] 'We Are No Longer Going to Be Handouts for Those That Go Against Us': Nikki Haley Explains Trump's Global Leadership[42] Madison Dibble Independent Journal Review Sep 13, 2018  United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley has become known for her fiery remarks at the U.N.,\u00a0but she\u00a0is giving a lot of the credit for her U.N. strategy to President\u00a0Donald Trump and his global leadership. Ambassador Haley has made it clear that the United States will not be a doormat for the U.N. Under her leadership, the United States pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council[43], defended Israel[44] and the relocation of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem,[45] and cut funding[46] to nations that disrespect America or its values. Despite her personal successes within the U.N., Haley gave the credit to Trump and his entire administration during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier [President Trump] has actually done a lot in foreign\u00a0policy, but in different ways. If you look at what he's done with North Korea, I mean it's really led the international community to isolate North Korea to where they decide, you know, they have a decision to make. He led on the fact that he pulled out of the Iran deal. It's forcing the entire world to admit the fact that Iran was not behaving properly. He's led in Syria to make sure that chemical weapons aren't being used and he's warned against them being used again. I think if you look at the western hemisphere, which\u00a0we've spent the last two weeks focused on, whether it is Venezuela or Nicaragua, the messages are being sent that we're not going to support dictators. Haley explained that a lot of Trump's foreign policy successes stem from his ability to follow through with his demands if expectations are not met. 'We are no longer going to give money to people who are against the U.S. or say 'death to America,' or do anything that would be anti-U.S.,' Haley stated, adding, 'We are now going to strategically start to work with our friends and we are no longer going to be handouts for those that go against us.'

Malkin's analysis came in response to Wednesday's leaked video[49] of a Google 'all-hands meeting' days after 2016's presidential election.\u00a0During the meeting, Google's co-founder Sergey Brin suggested that President Donald Trump's supporters voted for him out of 'boredom', which he further credited as a historical driver of both fascism and communism. Malkin said, 'One last angle I want to get in here and it's something that Breitbart's education reporters have covered is Google's role in infiltrating the public schools. When they talk about boredom[50], what do they think is the cure? Well, stuffing our kids' minds and larding up their computers, which are donated by Google and all of these big tech companies into the classrooms with GAFE[51], which is Google Applications for Education Why? Not because they care about boredom or not, but they're tracking our kids. Who cares about tracking hijackers and jihadists? They're spending more money and building more infrastructure to track our kids from the time they get onto the bus until they graduate from college. That's what they're focused on.' Malkin spoke of Google's relationship with Democrats and the Obama administration: 'Google had free reign under the Obama White House, that's how the FERPA[52]   Family Education Rights and Privacy Act   was completely weakened to allow the third-party sale of our kids' data, and more needs to be done on that front. I'd like to see the Trump Education Department be doing more to combat that As part of the supposed repeal of Common Core, of course, it is the infiltration and the tentacles of the likes of Google and Microsoft and all of these Silicon Valley firms into the public schools which has gone unabated.' Google intends to leverage its knowledge and infrastructure to condition children into compliance with its vision, warned Malkin. 'It's not just searches,' said Malkin. 'It's not just curricula.

Malkin's comments came against the backdrop of Wednesday's publishing of a leaked video[56] from 2016 depicting Google's leadership lamenting the election of President Donald Trump and pledging global political opposition to both nationalism and populism. 'These companies cannot be treated as just any run-of-the-mill small business,' said Malkin. 'Not only because of their market cap, but because of their complete domination of the spaces by which most people in America in the 21st century are able to exercise their political free speech. That's how so much of my own social media and new media entrepreneur career has been possible I want to ensure that for the next generation that they still have platforms left if Google and Facebook and Twitter are left untouched. I'm not just talking about the Democrats, but I'm also talking about a lot of big business Republicans that are more interested in getting donations from these corporations than holding the line and holding them accountable.' Mansour remarked, 'They will shut us all down. They're going through us one by one.' Malkin responded, 'I've been shadowbanned for about a year and a half, and that is confirmed. I'm like 99.999 percent certain that my follower-count was throttled, as well. And now, of course, we have the news that certain phrases like 'illegal alien' are now triggering lockdowns on accounts and promotions and ads are not possible if you use the wrong phrases. This is Orwellian. It's alarming.' Twitter recently rejected[57] four advertisement requests from the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), claiming the ads contained 'hateful content.'\u00a0The hateful content in question appeared to be the term 'illegal alien.'

So did Russian trolls. '8 years ago today, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law. Millions of Americans have gained access to health care. Thank you, Mr. President!' said a tweet linked to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian company engaged in an online influence campaign that typically seeks to pit one side against the other on controversial issues. A newly identified group of nearly 10,000 tweets shows that while Russian trolls often focus on such hot-button issues as Hillary Clinton's email or athletes kneeling during the national anthem, they also target substantive and divisive policy areas like health care. How Russian Trolls Collected Americans' Personal Information: Nearly 600 IRA-linked accounts posted to Twitter[60] about the ACA and health policy from 2014 through this past May, with the most prolific ones tweeting hundreds of times, the new data show. One account, called TEN_GOP, rocketed from fewer than 1,000 followers to more than 138,000 in two years, sending 60 tweets that potentially reached followers more than four million times. Researchers at Clemson University provided The Wall Street Journal with the set of about 9,800 tweets involving health policy and the ACA that the IRA posted over that period. An analysis by the Journal found that 80% of the tweets had conservative-leaning political messages, often disparaging the health law. The accounts have been shut down by Twitter as congressional investigators unearthed their origin, but intelligence experts say the assault is continuing through similar accounts and channels. The tweets provide a snapshot of a continuing strategy[61], one that is likely now aimed at November's midterm elections[62] in which health care is playing a dominant role, experts said More[63] Twitter Shuts Down Iraqi Militia Leader's Account Over Rocket Attack on U.S. Consulate[64] Move came after prompting by U.S. authorities, U.S. says; no one was hurt in the Basra attack, which missed its target This is another appropriate use of censorshipAgain, it was prompted by the U.S. government for national security reasons Dave Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 12, 2018  Twitter[65] Inc. shut down the account of a prominent Iraqi militia leader after he was accused by the U.S. government of inciting violence against American diplomats in Basra, where the U.S. consulate came under a rocket attack. The episode illustrates the importance that social media has come to play in mobilizing political support in Iraq and, potentially, in encouraging militia attacks. It comes as Iraqi politicians are struggling to form a new government and the U.S. and Iran are vying for influence. A U.S. official said Twitter's decision Tuesday to block the account of Abu Mehdi al-Mohandis, the head of a Shiite militia group that has long been backed by Iran, was made after U.S. authorities raised concerns. Saturday's rocket attack missed the U.S. consulate in Basra and nobody was hurt. 'We brought it to their attention,' said State Dept. spokeswoman Heather Nauert. 'They understood the threat and took action.' Mr. Mohandis's supporters have complained about Twitter's action, saying it came with the encouragement of foreign interests. A spokesman for Twitter said the social-media company doesn't comment on actions concerning individual accounts for privacy and security reasons. Analysis cited by the company indicates that more than 90% of terrorist accounts are removed by Twitter based on its own monitoring efforts. Mr. Mohandis has long been a considered a notorious figure by Washington, although he has led some of the Shiite militia forces that have fought militants from Islamic State in recent years.\u00a0The U.S. has designated him as a terrorist[66] and has accused him of participating in the bombing of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait in the 1980s.\u00a0 During the Iraq war, Mr. Mohandis was involved in Tehran's effort to arm and train Iraqi Shiite militias that attacked U.S. and other allied troops, U.S. officials say. Mr. Mohandis's cooperation with Iran emerged in recently declassified interrogation reports[67] of another Shiite leader, Qais al-Khazali, who was captured by the U.S.-led coalition a decade ago and accused of organizing a botched kidnapping of five U.S. soldiers in 2007 that led to their deaths.\u00a0Mr. Khazali told interrogators that Mr. Mohandis was so close to the Iranians at the time that he probably didn't even own a house in Iraq. It was Mr. Mohandis's Saturday statements blaming the U.S. for the turmoil in Basra that prompted the Americans to approach Twitter about his messages. Still, the move won't preclude him from making comments through other media, such as television More[68] Iraq: Car bomb explosion kills at least 6 north of Baghdad[69].

Ironically, under two years later, it was revealed that Google has been working on a censored search engine for China in cooperation with the Chinese government. According to reports[72], the search engine, which has been in development since Spring 2017, 'will blacklist access to certain websites and restrict search terms related to human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest.' Employees working on the project were also ordered[73] by Google to 'keep quiet about it,' and 'deflect questions.' Following the revelation, over a dozen human rights groups condemned[74] Google for the project and urged the company to reconsider, while Google employees themselves started to fear[75] human rights violations as a result of the censored search engine. Despite a willingness to work with the Chinese government, with Google also working[76] on an artificial intelligence research center in the country, Google announced[77]\u00a0in June that they would no longer work with the U.S. government. In July, Rep.\u00a0Lamar Smith (R-TX), who serves as chair of the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee, described[78] Google's willingness to work with China but not the United States as 'awfully close to being un-American.' 'For the management of Google to be rolled so easily by their employees and not stand up for principle, not say we need to help everybody, and not defend helping the military who after all defends us every day of the year, was again an example of bias that we don't need,' he declared The video and more[79] Revolving Door: Dozens of Clinton Staffers Hired by Google   and Vice-Versa[80] Charlie Nash Breitbart News 13 Sep 2018  Dozens of people who used to work for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and a number of Clinton initiatives went on to work at Google, and vice-versa.

Brent Bozell III Fox News September 13, 2018 Google, owned by the same parent company as YouTube, is arguably the most influential social media company in the world, with a power to affect the public dialogue across the globe in ways unimaginable just a handful of years ago. The question is now being asked: Is Google flexing its muscles to do just that? Conservatives have pointed to mounting evidence that Google is waging war on them. They'll cite everything from YouTube banishing conservatives for espousing their beliefs, to Google partnering with left-wing organizations to disparage conservative thought itself. All along, Google has issued bizarre, barely understandable statements denying these charges. Now Google executives have been caught again - twice in the past two weeks. Actually, they have indicted themselves with explosive leaks of their own material. And it goes to the very top of the corporate food chain. Breitbart has released an explosive video of an hour-long post-election Google meeting featuring staff and top executives discussing their despair over the election of President Trump in 2016. There's a reason the video has a 'Confidential - Internal Use Only' label on top. It's about the last thing that company wanted the public to see. The video features Google co-founder Sergey Brin opening the meeting by declaring: 'I think it's a very stressful time. It conflicts with many of our values voting is not a rational act.' In one fell swoop he both endorsed Hillary Clinton and disparaged the Trump voters who Clinton referred to as 'deplorables.' The video features Google Vice President for Global Affairs Kent Walker dismissing the election results as 'a hiccup' interrupting the march of the left. Walker says: 'What are the next steps for us before the world comes into this environment of tribalism that's self-destructive (in) the long term?

According to Avlon, if the United States continues to ignore climate science, 'the cost of lives and dollars will escalate.' 'On the same day Trump was discussing [Hurricane] Florence, his EPA proposed rolling back restrictions on emissions of methane. That's just the latest environmental policy targeted by the Trump administration,' Avlon stated. He went on to note how two Harvard scientists claimed[97] Trump's policies and getting the country out of the Paris Climate Agreement could lead to 80,000 deaths every decade. 'It is so bad according to two Harvard scientists said it could lead to 80,000 unnecessary deaths every decade,' said Avlon. 'Warmer water means more intense storms. When President Trump called Hurricane Florence tremendously wet, he was actually on to something.' He later concluded, 'This isn't rocket science, folks, it's climate science.\u00a0And as long as we continue to aggressively ignore it, the cost in lives and dollars will escalate.

Al Green (D-TX) explained on Thursday that he owes it to 'unborn generations' to impeach President Donald Trump. Green, who has insisted that Trump does not have to commit a crime to get impeached, told the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's Annual Legislative Conference that 'bigotry in this country is the number one problem facing a good many Americans, many of whom are of African ancestry.' He said bigotry must be combated 'with an agenda.' 'I will bring Articles of Impeachment once we have a new Congress,' Green said. 'If no one else does, I will do it because I owe it to unborn generations to do what I can to take on this challenge.' Green said it is his responsibility 'to make sure that everyone goes on record because history is going to judge us all this is a moment in time when the world is watching and we ought not let bigotry of this magnitude go unchecked.' In response to people who ask him why he does not wait to push impeachment, Green said, 'Dr. King didn't wait.' The Texas Democrat said Martin Luther King went back to the Edmund Pettus Bridge after Bloody Sunday even though he knew 'invidious discrimination' would not end that day.

The ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan means 24-year-old Mohammad Hassan Khalid can continue his studies at a Maryland college. His Philadelphia lawyer, Wayne Sachs, called the decision a 'very satisfying victory for a well-deserving young man with a bright future.' He said the three-judge appeals panel, unlike four earlier courts, 'properly focused on the law rather than the petitioner's 'notoriety.'' The U.S. government did not immediately say if it planned to appeal. Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs wrote that he cannot congratulate Khalid, given that he 'plotted sneaking violence against Americans.'

Listed under the 'Hurricane Florence Rumor Control' heading, the rumors include that FEMA diverted almost $10 million to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to pay for detention and deportation efforts along the U.S. border with Mexico. Breitbart News reported[119] on that fake news cycle, which started with a Democratic Senator giving documents to MSNBC and continuing as other news outlets picked up the inaccurate story: 'Sen.

That my efforts and my energies, particularly when I'm fortunate enough to be in partnership with kinda fellow travelers, hopefully will make a difference.' She added, 'And when I think about all of the statistics that are painful of what women are confronting today in our country, and what even more women confronted pre-Roe and how many women died and how many more women were maimed because of unsafe abortion practices, we just can't go back to that. Like that's unconscionable to me, and also, I'm sure that this will unleash another wave of hate in my direction, but as a deeply religious person, it's also unchristian to me.' The video[124] Feinstein's shameful Kavanaugh Hail Mary pass[125] Lauren DeBellis Appell Fox News September 13, 2018 Senator Dianne Feinstein asks the FBI to review letter involving Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh; reaction on 'The Story' to what the White House is calling a delay tactic. In an act of desperation designed to block Judge Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court by smearing his reputation, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., hinted Thursday[126] that someone she would not name has made unspecified accusations about Kavanaugh that possibly might involve criminal conduct. Feinstein's Hail Mary pass came exactly one week before the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on the nomination of the highly qualified judge, who now sits on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Feinstein is leaving it to the media to fill in the facts about her vague and unsubstantiated claims about Kavanaugh, who was nominated by President Trump. She clearly is counting on Trump's many opponents in the media to help her keep the president's nominee off the Supreme Court - as they would seek to do for anyone nominated by Trump. Feinstein said in a statement: 'I have received information from an individual concerning the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. That individual strongly requested confidentiality, declined to come forward or press the matter further, and I have honored that decision. I have, however, referred the matter to federal investigative authorities.' What the heck does that mean? (Translation: I got nothing). OK - Feinstein is claiming she knows something - but she's not saying what that mystery something is. How on Earth is anyone supposed to evaluate that? How would any of you reading this like someone to make a cryptic charge like the one Feinstein has thrown out about you, without presenting a shred of evidence? Fox News reported that two sources said Feinstein got a letter from Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., in July making the allegations against Kavanaugh - although the senator never spoke about it publicly before Thursday. That's the way Hail Mary passes work - you don't throw one until you're desperate and headed for a loss on the football field. The mystery letter wasn't even concerning enough for Feinstein to show to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. The Intercept reported[127] the letter was sent by someone associated with Stanford University and involved a woman and Kavanaugh when she and the 53-year-old judge were both in high school The video and more[128] CANADA: GANG OF 'BURQA BANDITS' strikes again in an Ontario convenience store[129] BareNakedIslam September 13, 2018  Police in Ontario are looking for seven Muslims whom they believe teamed up to distract a convenience store employee while they robbed the store as well as stealing about $1,000 in cash.  CTV[130] (h/t Marvin W) Video camera surveillance shows five Muslim women in burqas and two bearded Muslim men enter the store. The men can be seen going straight to the front of the store and asking about lottery tickets while three of the five women can be seen heading to the back of the store. Two of the women can then be seen blocking the third woman from view as she sneaks into a back office. A camera in the office captures the woman trying unsuccessfully to open a locked safe and then searching around. The woman comes across a bag of cash and coins, puts it under her skirt and walks out The video[131] Man 'shouting Allahu Akbar' drives car into a crowd in France before being wrestled to the ground by bystanders[132] AFP The Daily Mail (UK) 14 September 2018  A man has been arrested after driving his car into a crowd of people outside a bar in southern France[133] while shouting Allahu Akbar, witnesses and local officials said. The 32-year-old suspect, believed to be a local, sped towards a crowd of about 50 outside the bar at around 1am Friday local time, witnesses said. However, his white Peugeot ran into barriers set up for the town's annual grape-harvesting festival featuring bull-fighting which attracts thousands of people. Two people standing behind the barriers received slight injuries to their legs. After the crash the man tried to flee but was dragged to the ground by onlookers and 'roughed up' before police arrived.\u00a0He was in a state of 'mental confusion' during his arrest and has been hospitalised, public prosecutor Eric Maurel said. Several witnesses told AFP that the man shouted 'Allahu Akbar' - God is Greatest in Arabic - during the incident More[134] Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary who inspired Lee Rigby's killers and London Bridge attacker is 'genuinely dangerous' and will be watched 'like a hawk' when he is freed next month, warns prisons minister[135] This is what happens when a country refuses to see that a war is being waged against it It jails the enemy according to a criminal code, instead of according to the rules of war If Britain recognized that a jihad was being waged against itit could punish Choudary as either a traitor, a seditionist, or an insurrectionistand either lock him up forever or execute him Instead, Choudary will soon be walking the streets, inciting jihad againand costing Britain millions of dollars to monitor him Britain will bankrupt itself if it allows too many people like Choudary on the streetsOnce that happens, the jihadists will winagainst a Britain that can no longer afford to defend itself Dave Joseph Curtis The Daily Mail (UK) 11 September 2018  Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary still poses a 'genuinely dangerous' threat to safety in the UK and the West ahead of his release from jail, a minister has warned. Prisons minister Rory Stewart said the 51-year-old, who inspired the killers of Lee Rigby and London[136] Bridge terrorist Khuram Butt, would be 'watched like a hawk' by police. The 51-year-old has served less than three years of a five-and-a-half-year sentence for inviting support for ISIS[137] and is currently in a special 'prison within a prison' at HMP Belmarsh. He spent five months inside before his trial took place which is part of the reason why his release next month has been triggered. Mr Stewart said he remained a 'destabilising influence' because he was part of a group of 'highly dangerous fanatical extremists' whose views cannot be changed and should be under surveillance. Speaking to the Evening Standard[138], Mr Stewart said: 'We have to put a very rich, full, MAPPA (multi agency public protection arrangements) wrap around them that includes everything going all the way up to MI5. That's GPS trackers, that's police, that's intelligence, watching every movement of their lives and restricting it incredibly closely because I'm in no doubt that these people are highly dangerous. Even if they are not themselves making bombs, they are a completely pernicious influence on the people they come into contact with and they need to be kept away from them.' He added: 'He [Choudary] is somebody that I would put into the category I have just mentioned   somebody who was not given a sentence of enormous length but somebody who is a genuinely dangerous person we will be watching him very, very carefully.'

The smugglers are heard asking each arriving migrant, reportedly from north Africa, to look into the camera before jumping off a boat and swimming to the Playa de Los Lances beach in the Cadiz province. A Spanish voice is heard giving the migrants instructions to 'wait' and 'look at the camera' as the young men jump into the water one at a time. Some of them are heard saying 'gracias' - 'thanks' - before leaping into the sea.  This video captures people smugglers filming the 'safe delivery' of illegal immigrants in Spain to ensure payment from their relatives. The footage is believed to be used by the smugglers as proof that the migrants have reached Spain. After showing it to relatives of the migrants, they are believed to receive the final instalment of a sum that is reportedly around  2,000 (\u00a31,784) per person Spain has become the main entry point for migrants arriving in Europe after Italy began closing its ports to rescue vessels. Over 33,000 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea and land so far this year, according to the International Organization for Migration.\u00a0A further 313 have perished attempting the crossing.\u00a0 The area around the Straits of Gibraltar has long been a route for smuggling drugs and contraband tobacco. But recently, the Spanish Civil Guard have observed how the same criminal gangs have moved into people smuggling. A Civil Guard spokesperson said: 'There is a dangerous synergy of criminal activities, drug trafficking and mafias that are getting rich through the desperation of people illegally trying to reach Spanish territory.'

Speaking in the multicultural city of Malm\u00f6, where nearly half of residents are of foreign background, with Iraqis making up[145] the largest single group, the leader of Tibetan Buddhism said[146] Sweden is seen as 'a peaceful, generally prosperous country' with a relatively small gap between rich and poor. 'Spontaneously', reports[147] Norrk\u00f6pings Tidningar, the Dalai Lama then 'moved on to talk about one of the biggest issues in the Swedish election   the reception of refugees'. Noting that a large number of immigrants have settled in Europe from the Middle East and elsewhere, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual leader said it was good for nations to help 'a refugee really facing danger against their life'. 'Receive them, help them, educate them but ultimately they should develop their own country,' said[148] the 83-year-old Tibetan. 'I think Europe belongs to the Europeans,' he added, stressing that countries like Germany and Sweden should make clear that refugees must 'return to their homelands and rebuild them'.

The European Union's legislature voted overwhelmingly to label Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government a 'systemic threat to the rule of law.' The vote carries no immediate consequences, though it could theoretically lead to sanctions.  Mr. Orban is at the front of the two biggest challenges to the EU's authority: on migration and on the removal of domestic checks and balances. That has left Brussels in standoffs with more member states, especially in the south and east of the bloc, at a time when the EU is locked in a trade fight with Washington and seeking to avert a fresh crisis over Britain's exit from the bloc. On migration, Mr. Orban was a leader of European anti-immigrant policies, building a fence to keep out refugees and refusing to participate in an EU-wide relocation program for asylum seekers. His views have moved increasingly into the mainstream since the 2015 migration crisis. Mr. Orban has recently made common cause with Matteo Salvini, the popular Italian interior minister who leads the fiercely anti-immigration party, the League, in Italy's new government. But it is Mr. Orban's challenge to EU's rules governing democracy that was under scrutiny this week by lawmakers. His government has exerted control over the courts, media regulators and tax inspectors, building what he calls an 'illiberal state' that would emulate countries such as China and Russia. Czech and Polish leaders have spoken positively about that vision. European lawmakers on Wednesday voted to censure the Hungarian government, saying it is undermining European values. Mr. Orban has directed government contracts to his friends and political allies, who have in turn purchased most of the country's TV and radio stations, members of Parliament said. While the vote passed with a clear majority, some fear it could do little to restrain the Hungarian leader, who said the bloc was meddling in his country's internal affairs. Mr. Orban's government will now be labeled a threat to Europe's democratic order, the same charge the EU's executive has thrown at the Polish government over its overhaul of the judiciary. Any sanctions could see EU funding for the two countries slashed and possibly lead to both losing some voting rights at the EU level. However, the imposition of sanctions would require all other EU member states to agree, an unlikely prospect.  Mr. Orban, the first European head of government to endorse Donald Trump's presidential campaign, has wide support from Europe's nativist leaders. On Tuesday, Polish President Andrzej Duda denounced the EU for interfering in domestic affairs like Hungary's, calling the union an 'imaginary community.' Like many nationalist politicians on the rise in Europe, Mr. Orban cemented his power by attacking the EU for its alleged power grabs, particularly on migration policy. But unlike his Polish or Italian peers, Mr. Orban has kept close ties to center-right leaders in Europe, some of whom have warmed to his migration policies aiming to keep out asylum seekers from Syria and elsewhere.

'He better be careful what he is wishing for, that I can tell you,' Trump said in an interviewon Fox and Friends, 'That's a disgusting statement for him to make, for him to make a statement like that is a very dangerous statement.'Holder was captured on videochallenging[3] former First Lady Michelle Obama's statement that 'when they go low, we go high.' 'No. No,' Holder said. 'When they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new Democratic party is all about,' he said. </p><p>Trump cautioned Democrats to 'be careful' with their rhetoric, noting that his rallies with supporters were 'calm and well run.' 'We don't have problems with our rallies,' he said. Trump reminded the audience that Holder was found in contempt of Congress and that he 'went after Christians' as well as the Tea Party More[4] Rep. Steve Scalise: When Eric Holder, other Dems call for violence, that's a direct threat to our democracy[5] Rep. Steve Scalise Fox News October 11, 2018 This summer, California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters called on her supporters to harass cabinet officials. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that you 'cannot be civil' with members of the Republican Party. And Wednesday,videotape was released of former Attorney General Eric Holder telling a Democratic audience at a campaign rally in Georgia on Sunday thatthey should 'kick' Republicans when they perceive them as 'going low[6].'  Despite the continued reports of politically motivated threats or violence, Democratic Party leaders have worked to keep this anger burning and incite even more harassment and violence.  Beginning with my own near-death experience at the hands of a deranged shooter who sought to assassinate a baseball field of Republicans, there is a growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats.  Ashley Kavanaugh, Justice Brett Kavanaugh's wife and his daughters received multiple credible threats. Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman, received death threats against her children on Twitter. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn.,received such a threatening phone call that the man has now been indicted. Jamie Gardner, wife of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., wife, received a text of a beheading after the vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh. Several Republican Senators had their personal information, including home addresses, posted to Wikipedia for threatening purposes by a Democrat House staffer. Congressman Clay Higgins (R-La.) received threatening phone calls that led to a man's arrest. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kent.,and his wife Kelly Paul have both received credible threats that have led to arrests. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,and his wife, as well as White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, were chased out of restaurants. Departmentof Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters and harassed out of a DC restaurant. Rudy Peters, a Republican California Congressional candidate, was nearly stabbed while campaigning. My office has continued to receive threats against my life that have led to arrests. A female pro-life activist was violently assaulted by a man that has now been found guilty of eight counts of assault for this and similar incidents.  And this list goes on. The threats and the violence have not let up and instead of seeing my Democrat colleagues calling for an end, there have been calls for their supporters to keep going, to do even more to threaten Republicans More[7] Law Students Organize Nationwide 3-Day Walkout over Brett Kavanaugh[8] Is this is the kind of legal argument that the students of today's top laws schools make nowadays?These schools need to have their accreditations taken awayand parents should sue to get their money back Dave Tom Ciccotta Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Law students around the country are skipping class this week to protest Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Law students around the country are in the middle of a three-day walkout protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Starting on Wednesday, students at law schools around the country walked out of their classrooms at 2:15 p.m. with the intention of returning on Monday morning. The students believe their protest will encourage congressionalcandidates to announce their commitment to impeaching recently confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Students at the law schools at American University, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, New York University, and Temple University have signed on to participate[9] in the protest. In an open letter[10] on the StrikeAgainstKavanaugh.com, student organizers say that they don't believe Brett Kavanaugh is a 'legitimate' Supreme Court justice. The letter makes an unusual tie-in to America's history of brutality against Native Americans. We are in the middle of a national emergency. Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court. We cannot accept a system that empowers a man who repeatedly lied under oath and a judiciary review process that only performs a sham of an investigation into his misconduct.We do not recognize Kavanaugh as a legitimate member of the United States Supreme Court. As we announce this strike on Indigenous Peoples' Day, we recognize the ongoing harm indigenous people have suffered under the American legal system. The United States was borne out of conquest of indigenous people by European colonizers whose descendants became this country's founders. Since the Supreme Court's first case involving indigenous rights,the Court has heard hundreds of cases and it has been grossly unjust to indigenous plaintiffs and defendants. Later this term, the Court could curtail the hunting rights of the Crow Tribes, rights which are 'central to [the] Tribes' subsistence, economy, culture, spiritual life, and day-to-day existence.' We do not believe that Kavanaugh will be a champion for indigenous peoples' rights, and fear the worst for the indigenous communities who have already faced so much harm from the Court. A local news report[11] from Wednesday revealed that students at Ohio State University's law school walked out of their classrooms at 11:10 a.m. to protest Kavanaugh's confirmation. Students told reporters that they believed that Dr. Ford's allegations were not taken seriously by members of Congress. Some said that they participated in the protest to bring attention to the ever-present issue of sexual assault More[12] UNC Asheville Professor Amanda Wray Arrested for Allegedly Stealing Conservative Political Signs[13]: A Professor at the University of North Carolina Asheville was arrested on Sunday and charged with a misdemeanor for stealing conservative political signs. Democrats Rage Against the Judiciary[14]: Their campaign against Kavanaugh failed, so they resort to smearing the Supreme Court itself. Jason L. Riley The Wall Street Journal Oct. 9, 2018  Protesters stand in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Oct. 9 Brett Kavanaugh endured a Supreme Court confirmation ordeal like no other. He's now Justice Kavanaugh, but that doesn't mean the Democrats are done with him. Or even close to being done with him. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants the Federal Bureau of Investigation report on sexual-assault allegations, heretofore seen only by senators and staff, made public. Rep. Jerry Nadler, who's in line to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has vowed to reopen investigations into Justice Kavanaugh's background if Democrats win control of the House next month. Democrats aren't playing up talk of impeachment, but they haven't ruled it out. Mr. Nadler knows that an attempt to remove a justice from the Supreme Court, which requires a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate, would almost certainly fail. And Mrs. Pelosi is well aware that there are very good reasons why FBI background checks are confidential. Information gathered could be sensitive or embarrassing; much of it is hearsay; and people are less likely to speak openly and honestly with investigators in the future if they have to worry about being publicly identified. So, is any of this going anywhere? Not likely, but that's not the point of these exercises. The left is angry right now\u2014bordering on unhinged\u2014and Democrats hope stoking this rage will help get their voters to the polls on Nov. 6. The risk is that these continued attacks on Justice Kavanaugh's character\u2014and the promise of more to come\u2014might also boost Republican turnout. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thanked Democrats and left-wing activist for mobilizing Republican voters, he was being sincere. Since the hearings, whatever voter-enthusiasm edge Democrats previously enjoyed has all but disappeared. Republicans in the Trump era are divided on some issues, but putting conservatives on the Supreme Court isn't one of them. If Democrats weren't so busy blaming Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, they might recall that Mr. Trump's campaign promise to nominate judges in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia went a long way toward unifying his Republican support. Having lost the fight over Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats quickly pivoted to attacking the Supreme Court as an institution. After the confirmation vote Saturday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein tweeted that his appointment 'undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.' Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, another Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, added: 'The damage done today will be enduring\u2014to the United States Supreme Court ... our country.' What's next, encouraging citizens to disregard certain rulings by certain justices?  Questioning the legitimacy of the court and undercutting confidence in the judicial branch is irresponsible and dangerous. The tactic recalls some of the ugliest periods in our nation's history, and today it's a mainstream Democratic talking point More[15] Kanye West Brings '4D Chess' to the White House: 'We Have to Release the Love'[16] Stay tuned as the Left's hair goes on fire[17] Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  President Donald Trump met with hip-hop superstar and fashion mogul Kanye West at the on Thursday and spoke to the media in the Oval Office. 'Trump is on his hero's journey right now,' West said. 'He might not have thought he'd have a crazy mother-fucker like Kanye West run up and support, but best believe \u2014 we are going to make America great.' West wore Trump's campaign MAGA hat, urging Americans to rally around the president. He said that the hat was his 'superman cape' allowing him to do whatever he wanted. 'We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunities,' he said. Kanye West spoke for about 20minutes, discussing his support for Trump and even took questions from reporters. 'I don't answer questions that are simple soundbites. You are tasting a fine wine, it has multiple notes to it,' he said. 'You better play 4D chess with me like Minority Report.' West talked about growing economic opportunities, rebuilding cities as well as race and culture issues. Trump praised Kanye's remarks, which had to be edited by TV censors before it was aired on cable news. 'He can speak for me any time he wants. He's a smart cookie,' he said. 'He gets it.' 'It was from the soul,' West replied, 'I just channeled it.' When reporters asked Trump if he believed that West could be a presidential candidate, Trump replied, 'Could very well be.' 'Only after, 2024,' West replied. The famous music star said he was proud to voice his support and gave the president a hug at the end of the meeting. 'I love this guy right here,' West said The video[18] Kanye West Stands by the Second Amendment: 'We Have the Right to Bear Arms'[19] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Hip-hop superstar Kanye West defended the Second Amendment on Thursday, in a visit at the White House with President Donald Trump. West was asked reporters about gun violence in Chicago. 'The problem is illegal guns,' West replied. 'Illegal is the problem, not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms.' He said that there was a lot of hate building between police officers and the black community, but that the country also had to discuss black-on-black violence. 'As black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we're doing. We kill each other more than police officers,' he said More[20] Rapper T.I.: I Would Have Slapped 'A** Kissing' Kanye at that Trump Meeting[21] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Rapper T.I. said in an Instagram post that he would have slapped Kanye West in the face if he was at the White House meeting with President Trump Thursday. T.I. called Kanye West's meeting with Trump 'next level, futuristic Sambo ,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!!' 'From what I can gather This is the most repulsive, disgraceful,Embarrassing act of desperation ...ctioning off of one's soul to gain power I've ever seen,' he added. The Live Your Life rapper then said that he would have gotten violent with West if he were there. 'Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally) but bro if ain'time I would've been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence, I feel that I'd be compelled to slap de'Fuq outta you bro For the People!!!

Lemon said, 'I have no animosity for Kanye West. I'm just going to be honest, and I may get in a lot of trouble for it. I actually feel bad for him. What I saw was a minstrel show today\u2014him in front of all these white people, mostly white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans but mostly African Americans because every one of them is sitting either at home or with their phones cringing.' He added, 'I couldn't even watch it. I had to turn the television off because it was so hard to watch the president of the United States exploiting him. And I don't mean this in a disparaging way, exploiting someone who needs help, who needs to back away from the cameras, who needs to get off stage, who needs to deal with his issues.'

Dave Pam Key Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Thursday on MSNBC's 'Live With Velshi and Ruhle,' anchor Stephanie Ruhle said hip-hop star Kanye West's comments[27] in the Oval Office today were 'an assault on our White House.' Co-host Ali Velshi said, 'That was bonkers.' Ruhle stated, 'If you think you're going to get a thoughtful play-by-play and political analysis, you're not. Because that was an assault on our White House.'

Have a bunch of white liberals attack Kanye West Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  While most media and entertainment elites are railing against hip-hop star Kanye West, Dave Chappelle, his longtime friend and creative collaborator is defending the vocal Trump support's right to speak out about his passions. In a sit-down interview scheduled to air on CNN at 7 p.m. EST Saturday, host Van Jones pressed Chappelle on what he thinks about West's newfound outspokenness toward the Democrat Party. 'First of all, you know, Kanye's an artist, man. He's a genius.' Chappelle said. 'I think the angle he's seeing things from is about the division that he sees. And he's not inconsistent with what he's saying,' Chappelle said,[42]referring to West'sefforts to reclaim theConfederate flag.

The segment \u2014 which has been slammed as 'racist' \u2014began with Lemon asking if President Donald Trump is simply 'using Kanye as a prop to win over black voters before the midterms.' CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers responded with a jab at West: 'Anti-intellectualism simply isn't cool Kanye West is what happens when Negros don't read.' Sellers' remark prompted laughter from Lemon and fellow panelist Tara Setmayer, who followed up by saying West is 'the token negro of the Trump administration.' Walker, who has openly supportedTrump, is also an outspoken advocate for mental health issues - which were also mocked during the segment. Walker took to Twitter to express his disbelief. 'Went to bed appalled over Don Lemon's despicable behavior laughing atTara Setmayer and Bakari Sellers' awful remarks about Kanye West's visit with [Trump]! Woke up wondering whyCNN doesn't take all three off the air?' Walker tweeted, adding the hashtag'#Shameful.' Setmayer fired back at Walker: 'Bless your heart You want to silence me because I expressed a different opinion than yours? Because I called out Kanye for what he is? Uninformed! I'm an actual conservative, who's worked on policy advancing those principles for 20-plus years. I'll never be a shill for Trump.' Walker - who has dabbled in mixed martial arts in addition to his iconic football career - isn't one to back down from a fight and quickly responded. 'NoTara Setmayer, anyone that is African American with an opinion different than yours, you want to call them out by using the N-word and Don Lemon is laughing?To me that's bullying and shameful,' he tweeted back More[46] University of Georgia Protester to Candace Owens: 'You're Not Black'[47] Alana Mastrangelo Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle joined Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens on the second stop of Turning Point USA's Campus Clash tour Tuesday at the University of Georgia. The four spoke to an audience of 1,500 students and supporters, but one protester took issue with Owens' race. Among the crowd were protesters who seemed to take displeasure in the fact that Owens is a black conservative. 'You're not black!' Shouted one agitator while Owens explained why she left the Democrats. '[The Left] believes that someone loses their blackness as soon as they become a conservative,' reacted Kirk, 'They did this to Clarence Thomas, they did this to Dr. Ben Carson, and now they're doing this to Candace Owens.' 'Make no mistake, the Left believes that they own black people,' added Owens, 'So when a black person has the audacity to stand on stage and say\u2014I no longer agree with these policies, and I would like to think with my brain as opposed to my skin tone, they lose their minds.'

Smith Met With Former Trump Adviser Michael Flynn in 2015[52] New email and interviews indicate the Republican operative who sought to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails had established a relationship with Mr. Flynn The Mueller investigation's attempts to find links of collusionbetween President Trump and Russiakeep getting more remote and improbable Instead of criminal behavior, the investigators will settle for tenuous innuendo When will this silliness end? Dave Shelby Holliday, Byron Tau and Dustin Volz The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  A veteran Republican activist whose quest to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from hackers dominated the final months of his life struck up a professional relationship with Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser to President Trump, as early as 2015, and told associates during the presidential campaign that he was using the retired general's connections to help him on the email project. The late Peter W. Smith, an Illinois financier with a long history in Republican politics, met with Mr. Flynn in 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time, Mr. Flynn had recently left his job as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and was trying to set up his own consulting firm, while Mr. Smith was looking at investment opportunities in cybersecurity.  Mr. Flynn was a top adviser to Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign. He served briefly as national security adviser in Mr. Trump's administration before being forced to resign and pleading guilty to a charge of lying to authorities[53] about his conversations with a Russian ambassador Additionally, in an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, one of Mr. Smith's former associates wrote to a friend last week, 'As you are aware Peter started a business relationship with Gen. Mike Flynn in November 2015. We spoke with him on the day he left for his trip to Moscow.'

Richard Pinedo, who pleaded guilty in February to identity fraud, said in court he hadn't understood what sort of customers he was dealing with, and that his 'quiet, anonymous life' had been turned upside down by the case. The Russians who bought the information from Mr. Pinedo have been accused of mounting a broad effort to interfere in the 2016 election, the focus of Mr. Mueller's probe.  From 2014 through December 2017, prosecutors said, Mr. Pinedo sold anonymous customers hundreds of bank account numbers belonging to real people in order to help them circumvent PayPal[56] security protocols. 'I was convinced the services I was offering didn't hurt anyone,' the 28-year-old Mr. Pinedo said, reading quickly from a statement. Since the case was made public, he said, he has received hate-filled messages from strangers, some calling him a traitor to his country and others saying Russia would poison him for cooperating with the FBI. Mr. Pinedo, who lives with his family in Santa Paula, Calif., and was close to completing an associate degree in computer science, was one of the more unlikely defendants to be caught up in Mr. Mueller's inquiry. He earned money selling items on eBay[57] , and a dispute with PayPal over his account led him to offer services to help people evade the payment company's security measures, according to court documents. Among those who used his services were Russian nationals[58] who posted divisive social-media messages, invented fake personas and staged rallies with the strategic goal of sowing discord in American politics in 2016, prosecutors say More[59] Fusion GPS co-founder to take the Fifth to avoid testifying[60] Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 11, 2018 The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that produced the now-infamous Trump-Russia dossier, will invoke his First and Fifth Amendment privileges in order to avoid testifying before the House Judiciary Committeenext week, his lawyer said Thursday. The committee had subpoenaed Glenn Simpson to appear for a closed-door deposition last month after attorney Joshua Levy said his client would not participate voluntarily.Simpson has previously sat for three congressional interviews as part of investigations into Russian activities during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In a letter to committee chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., Levy accused Republicans on the panel of trying to 'discredit and otherwise damage witnesses to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, all as part of an effort to protect' President Trump. Levy added that the committee 'has abdicated and indeed perverted its constitutional and traditional role' and shown 'abundant bad faith' toward Simpson More[61] MSNBC's Chris Hayes Claims, Without Evidence, Trump Taking 'Massive Bribes' from Saudi Arabia[62] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted an unhinged conspiracy theory Wednesday night, suggesting that President Trump could be receiving 'massive bribes' from Saudis for his 'tacit approval' of them killing their critics. 'Would be nice to definitively rule out that the Saudis are paying the president massive bribes in exchange for tacit approval for murdering critics!' Chris Hayes tweeted 'And it would be easy to do: give Amer-icans some actual transparency into the president's personal and Trump Org finances,' he also wrote. Hayes is referencing the disappearance[63] of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi ArabianWashington Post writer who was a critic of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Trump said[64] that he has reached out to Saudi Arabia for answers about Khashoggi's disappearance Wednesday. Hayes' Twitter presence regularly becomes unhinged. In September, Hayes sent a strange tweet seemingly comparing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to rape. 'So even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, I'm not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?' Hayes tweeted More[65] Turkey says it has video, audio of missing activist's murder at Saudi consulate, report says[66] Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 11, 2018 Turkish officials have told their American counterparts that they have audio and video recordings that prove writer and activist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month, the paper reported late Thursday. The recordings would represent the first hard evidence to support the Ankara government's contention that a 15-member 'assassination squad' apprehended Khashoggi after he entered the consulate on Oct. 2, then killed him and dismembered his body. Previously published surveillance footage shows the 59-year-old Khashoggi entering the consulate. Saudi officials have claimed that he left the building by a different way and they do not know his whereabouts. The Post report[67], which cited officials from both the U.S. and Turkey, said that Khashoggi's voice can be heard on the recording along with voices of other men speaking Arabic. One official said men can be heard beatingKhashoggi on the recording, while another says the recording indicates how Khashoggi was 'interrogated, tortured and then murdered.' The report added that Turkish officials have balked at releasing the recordings out of fear it would compromise intelligence methods. Turkish media, including sources close to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have previously claimed that Saudi royal guards, intelligence officers, soldiers and an autopsy expert had been part of the team flown in on the day Khashoggi vanished. Khashoggi, who has repeatedly criticized the Saudi leadership in columns for the Post, had gone to the Istanbulconsulate toget marriage paperwork as his fiancee waited outside. The fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, has led calls for the Trump administration to shed light on Khashoggi's fate. In an interview with 'Fox ...iends' Thursday morning, Trump said that 'we have investigators over there and we're working with Turkey' and with Saudi Arabia on the case, but he provided no evidence or elaboration. Later in the day, Trump told reporters at the White House that 'ifit turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation' besides canceling sales of U.S. weapons to the kingdom.; An Erdogan spokesman told the state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey and Saudi Arabia would form a 'joint working group' to look into the journalist's disappearance. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. was traveling to Saudi Arabia, and that the U.S. expects him to provide information about the Khashoggi case when he returns. She added that the U.S. had not requested the ambassador, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, to leave The video and more[68] Turkey Provides New Links to Alleged Saudi Role in Dissident's Killing[69] A team of alleged Saudi assassins flew to Istanbul on a Gulfstream jet controlled by the Saudi crown prince, Turkish officials say Rory Jones in Dubai, Margherita Stancati in Riyadh and Summer Said in London The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  The Gulfstream jets that Turkish officials say ferried operatives who apprehended and likely killed a dissident Saudi journalist in Istanbul belong to a company controlled by Saudi Arabia's crown prince, people familiar with the matter said. Turkish authorities also released on Wednesday the names and photographs of the 15 men they say were involved in Jamal Khashoggi's suspected killing[70] in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 before returning hours later to Saudi Arabia. They included a forensics expert and a man who in 2017 was pictured wearing a Saudi Royal Guard uniform. Saudi officials have denied involvement and say they are assisting the Turkish investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance. Officials didn't respond to requests to comment. Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington resident living in self-imposed exile, was in Istanbul to obtain documents to marry his Turkish fiance when he disappeared, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two influential regional rivals that are both U.S. allies.  President Trump said Wednesday he had spoken to Saudis 'at the highest level' about Mr. Khashoggi and planned to find out what happened to him. The White House said that other top administration officials\u2014national security adviser John Bolton, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2014pressed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the issue by phone.  'This is a bad situation,' Mr. Trump told reporters. 'We cannot let this happen. To reporters, to anybody. We're going to get to the bottom of this,' he added More[71] US-Saudi relations hit snag over journalist's disappearance[72] Deb Riechmann and Jonathan Lemire Associated Press October 12, 2018 WASHINGTON - Sword dancers. Gleaming palaces. Military jets streaming red, white and blue trails. President Donald Trump soaked up the grandeur of Saudi Arabia on his first foreign stop as president last year and envisioned huge benefits for the United States in building closer ties with the repressive and oil-rich desert kingdom. Now, the White House relationship with Riyadh is imperiled over the mysterious disappearance of a Saudi writer, and the situation is creating friction between the Trump administration and members of Congress demanding to know if the columnist for The Washington Post was killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Trump said he's talked to officials at the highest level of the kingdom and is 'demanding everything' to explain how Jamal Khashoggi, an activist who had been critical of Saudi leaders, vanished after he walked into the consulate in Istanbul to get documents he needed to get married. Turkish authorities claim Khashoggi, who resided in the United States, was killed by members of an elite Saudi 'assassination squad.' The kingdom describes the allegation as 'baseless.' But if Saudi Arabia is found to be complicit in his disappearance or death, the warm U.S.-Saudi relationship \u2014 and even hopes for Middle East peace \u2014 could be upended. Trump has backed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious campaign to modernize the conservative kingdom and its economy. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who exchanges phone and text messages with the young crown prince, was instrumental in last year's deal to sell $110 billion in U.S. weapons to the kingdom. But even before Khashoggi vanished, concerns were mounting in Congress over Saudi Arabia's policies and the crown prince's aggressive steps to silence his critics. And now there are calls on Capitol Hill for the U.S. to halt arms sales to the kingdom, and Khashoggi's disappearance could galvanize more opposition from lawmakers and pressure Trump to rethink his relations with Saudi Arabia. Trump on Thursday pronounced U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia 'excellent' and said he doesn't want to scuttle arms deals with Riyadh because it means tens of millions of dollars pouring into the U.S. economy. He said the kingdom would simply buy the weapons from Russia or China instead. 'If it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation,' he said without elaborating. Much of how the U.S. responds will depend on whether evidence surfaces that proves Saudi Arabia is responsible for Khashoggi's death. Trump will have to craft a 'calibrated response,' said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'He doesn't like that approach. The president likes complete wins.' The close ties between the Trump White House and the kingdom were in part forged by a friendship between two young princes: Last spring, Kushner and the crown prince met formally for the first time as a late-season snow fell outside the White House. The two men \u2014 both in their 30s, both trusted aides of older, familial leaders \u2014 struck a bond. As their countries' chief negotiators on Israeli-Palestinian peace, Kushner and the Saudi prince were both looking to make a name for themselves on the world stage and consulted with each other frequently over the following months. Kushner championed Crown Prince Mohammed to the president and senior foreign policy officials, some of whom expressed wariness at the embrace of MBS, as he is known in diplomatic circles More[73] U.S. Lawmakers Challenge Trump's Support for Saudi War In Yemen[74] Bipartisan group of senators seek answers from Secretary of State Pompeo over backing of Gulf allies Saudi behavior is making American allegiance untenable The wise course of action would be for us to treat Saudi Arabia the same way we treat IranWe should enforce a quarantine on both nationsand as they fall apart, from destroying each other and being torn apart internallywe should prevent Muslim 'refugees' from leaving those regions for the West If Islam is such a great 'complete way of life[75]'then is should do just fine without being propped upby Western commerce, aid, new inventions, and weapons Such a quarantine would reveal Islam's parasitic natureIslamic nations need money, inventions, and products from the Westwhile at the same time they seek to overthrow the West We don't have to defeat the Islamic world We need to isolate it and stop subsidizing itWithout the lifeblood of Western support, the Islamic world would die on the vine Dave Dion Nissenbaum The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014U.S. lawmakers from both parties are challenging the Trump administration's support for Gulf allies battling Iran-aligned fighters in Yemen, putting new pressure on the U.S. president to scale back ties with Saudi Arabia during an especially sensitive time. A bipartisan group of senators plan to demand answers on Wednesday from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he backed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates[76] over the objections of most of his Yemen experts. In a letter delivered to Mr. Pompeo on Wednesday, the lawmakers, led by Sens. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), write that they have 'significant concerns' with his support for the Gulf allies.  'We find it difficult to reconcile known facts' with the decision to officially certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were taking meaningful steps to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen and that they were following the law when using weapons sold by the U.S. The certification was the first by Mr. Pompeo under a new law that requires him to certify to Congress every six months that the Gulf nations are doing all they can to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen The letter is part of an expanding effort in Congress to choke off American support for the two Gulf allies trying to contain a threat posed by Houthi fighters.

The Muslim Research and Development Fund (MRDF) is one of severalgroups that have received donations through Amazon Smile, which launched in the U.K. last year. Under the program, shoppers can select an organization which will receive 0.5 percent of thepurchase price of Amazon products. Haitham al-Haddad, the MRDF's founder and former chairman, has been called 'one of the most dangerous men in Britain' by the counter-extremist Quilliam Foundation due to his adherence to the Salafi movement within Sunni Islam. Terror groups such as Al Qaeda have embraced Salafism's tenants of jihadacross theworld. Amazon has allowed its U.K. users to donate money to theMuslim Research and Development Fund, a group whose key figure has espoused beliefs described as 'misogynistic, racist and homophobic,' according to a report.  According to the Times, while Haddad has criticized terrorist attacks against 'innocent civilians,' he also has stated that Muslims ultimately will conquer 'the enemies of Islam' and establish a regime that will deploy the death penalty for adultery and refusing to follow the Muslim faith. 'I have received so many requests from western women who committed adultery,' the Times quoted Haddad as saying in 2012. 'They were begging me to help them to find a way to a Muslim country to be stoned to death.' Spokesmen for Haddad previously have said that his statements were taken out of context. Sara Khan, the British government's counter-extremism commissioner, told the paper that Haddad's views 'promote a supremacist 'us versus them'worldview that wrongly makes Muslims feel that they can't be fully British.' In a statement obtained by Fox News, Amazon said it relied on a regulator, the Charity Commission for England and Wales, to determine which organizations were eligible to take part in Amazon Smile. 'If a charity no longer has charitable status because that organization supports, encourages or promotes intolerance or discrimination and has been removed from the Commission's register, we will remove them from the service,' the statement continued, adding that Amazon had 'referred these allegations to the Commission and will be conducting a full review to ensure they do not violate our policies.' More[82] Lawmakers Push to Rein In Tech Firms After Google+ Disclosure[83]  Exposure of users' private information on social-media service prompts calls from both parties for action  John D. McKinnon The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014Top lawmakers of both parties argued Wednesday that Congress needs to take action to rein in big tech companies, citing revelations about Google+ as the latest example of questionable practices involving consumers' private information. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Google exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users of its Google+ social network. The company, a unit of Alphabet[84] Inc., GOOGL +1.75% [85]chose not disclose the issue earlier this year, in part because of worries that news of the incident would bring on regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage[86], according to interviews and documents. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R., S.D.) said it is increasingly clear from Google+ as well as Facebook[87] Inc.'s earlier Cambridge Analytica scandal that industry self-regulation is no longer sufficient to protect users' privacy. 'A national standard for privacy rules of the road is needed to protect consumers,' Mr. Thune said. He warned that given previous congressional struggles with the issue, all sides must keep 'open minds' about the contours of a bipartisan bill.  The Federal Trade Commission is probing an incident in which data of up to 50 million Facebook users was transferred to Cambridge Analytica[88], a data firm that worked for President Trump during the 2016 campaign More[89] U.S. Detains Alleged Chinese Spy It Says Tried to Steal GE Trade Secrets[90]  Yanjun Xu, arrested in Belgium and extradited this week, is an official of China's Ministry of State Security, Justice Department says Aruna Viswanatha The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  An alleged Chinese intelligence operative arrested in Belgium has been brought to the U.S. and charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other companies, marking a rare break for the U.S. in its increasingly aggressive effort to target Chinese industrial spying.  Prosecutors have previously charged Chinese government officials with economic espionage and hacking-related offenses pointing to state-directed efforts to steal U.S. technology, but have never publicly identified anyone in custody as a Chinese intelligence officer. The arrested man, Yanjun Xu, made an initial appearance in federal court in Ohio on Wednesday.  'This case is not an isolated incident. It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense,' John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's national-security division, said in announcing the charges More[91] University of Michigan Bans Professors from Withholding Support to Pro-Israel Students[92] Tom Ciccotta Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  The University of Michigan is acting now to prevent professors from refusing support to students with opposing political views. In September, Breitbart News reported[93] on University of Michigan Professor John Cheney-Lippold, who refused to write a letter of recommendation for a student that was looking to study abroad in Israel. 'I am very sorry, but I only scanned your first email a couple weeks ago and missed out on a key detail,' Cheney-Lippold wrote in an email to the student. 'As you may know, many university departments have pledged an academic boycott against Israel in support of Palestinians living in Palestine. This boycott includes writing letters of recommendation for students planning to study there.' Last week, another professor at the University of Michigan refused[94] to write a letter of recommendation for a student looking to study abroad in Israel. In a statement[95] that was published on Tuesday, University of Michigan PresidentMark S. Schlissel argued that it is unacceptable to withhold recommendation letters based on a student's personal beliefs. Two U-M students were recently denied promised letters of recommendation for academic programs based on the personal views of two individuals with instructional responsibilities. The students were applying to study in Israel. Withholding letters of recommendation based on personal views does not meet our university's expectations for supporting the academic aspirations of our students. Conduct that violates this expectation and harms students will not be tolerated and will be addressed with serious consequences. Such actions interfere with our students' opportunities, violatetheiracademic freedom and betray our university's educational mission. The statement ends with a commitment from Schlissel that professors will support students regardless of their personal beliefs. 'We will work to make absolutely clear that faculty members' personal political beliefs cannot interfere with their obligations to our students with regard to letter-writing and all other modes of academic support,' he writes in the statement More[96] Tucker Carlson: 'Ship of Fools' - How Democrats lost their minds over immigration[97] Tucker Carlson Fox News October 11, 2018 The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the Trump administration's immigration policies. They were carrying Mexican flags and screaming: 'Si, se puede!' Yes we can.'Si, se puede' is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn't always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers union. When Chavez said 'Si, se puede,' he meant something very different: 'yes, we can seal the borders.'  Cesar Chavez hated immigration. He was Hispanic and left wing, but he called illegal Mexican immigrants 'wetbacks,' and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from Latin America will always work for less than Americans will. That's why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members' wages and weakened the union. 'As long as we have a poor country bordering California,' Chavez once explained, 'it's going to be very difficult to win strikes.' In California, Chavez remains a progressive hero. There's a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. Chavez's life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many Democrats agreed with Chavez. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt American workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 Mariel boatlift in Miami, found that high school educated Americans saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of Cuban refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn't surprising Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the Vietnamese. Even George McGovern, maybe the most liberal Democrat in the Senate, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. 'I think the Vietnamese are better off in Vietnam,' McGovern said As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. 'Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,' explained economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times. 'We'll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants.' That same year, Hillary Clinton voted for a fence on the Mexican border. So did Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and 23 other Senate Democrats.  But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after Bill Clinton told Americans they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 Democratic platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in the United States be, 'incorporated completely into our society through legal processes.' It was now Democratic Party orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote.  What changed? Not the economics of immigration Here's the short answer, in four simple facts:  There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders. Democrats plan to give them all citizenship.It's in their platform. Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat. The biggest landslide in American presidential history was only 17 million votes.  Do the math. The payoff for Democrats is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations.That's the point, no matter what they tell you.

Following a yearslong legal case that cost over half a million dollars, Britain's top court ruled the case wasn't about discrimination but rather boiled down to a different issue\u2014that people can refuse to promote messages they disagree with. In May 2014, Gareth Lee ordered a cake from Ashers, a bakery in Northern Ireland, for an event organized to campaign for same-sex marriage. In Northern Ireland, unlike in the rest of the U.K., same-sex marriage isn't currently legally recognized. Mr. Lee ordered a cake iced with a depiction of the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie and the words 'Support Gay Marriage.' The owners of Ashers refused to make the cake on the grounds that they didn't want to endorse same-sex marriage because it was against their religious beliefs. British judges found in the bakers' favor on the grounds that they weren't discriminating against Mr. Lee for being gay but were objecting to putting a message they didn't agree with on the cake More[100] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: Trump and Steve Scalise Talk Eric Holder's Threatening Rhetoric; Kanye Talks Love; More[101] appeared first on Western Free Press[102].

'He better be careful what he is wishing for, that I can tell you,' Trump said in an interview\u00a0on Fox and Friends, 'That's a disgusting statement for him to make, for him to make a statement like that is a very dangerous statement.'Holder was captured on video\u00a0challenging[3] former First Lady Michelle Obama's statement that 'when they go low, we go high.' 'No. No,' Holder said. 'When they go low, we kick 'em. That's what this new Democratic party is all about,' he said. </p><p>Trump cautioned Democrats to 'be careful' with their rhetoric, noting that his rallies with supporters were 'calm and well run.' 'We don't have problems with our rallies,' he said. Trump reminded the audience that Holder was found in contempt of Congress and that he 'went after Christians' as well as the Tea Party More[4] Rep. Steve Scalise: When Eric Holder, other Dems call for violence, that's a direct threat to our democracy[5] Rep. Steve Scalise Fox News October 11, 2018 This summer, California Democrat Rep. Maxine Waters called on her supporters to harass cabinet officials. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Tuesday that you 'cannot be civil' with members of the Republican Party. And Wednesday,\u00a0videotape was released of former Attorney General Eric Holder telling a Democratic audience at a campaign rally in Georgia on Sunday that\u00a0they should 'kick' Republicans when they perceive them as 'going low[6].'  Despite the continued reports of politically motivated threats or violence, Democratic Party leaders have worked to keep this anger burning and incite even more harassment and violence.  Beginning with my own near-death experience at the hands of a deranged shooter who sought to assassinate a baseball field of Republicans, there is a growing list of violent or threatening actions taken against conservatives by Democrats.  Ashley Kavanaugh, Justice Brett Kavanaugh's wife and his daughters received multiple credible threats. Dana Loesch, NRA spokeswoman, received death threats against her children on Twitter. Rep. Diane Black, R-Tenn.,\u00a0received such a threatening phone call that the man has now been indicted. Jamie Gardner, wife of Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., wife, received a text of a beheading after the vote to confirm Justice Kavanaugh. Several Republican Senators had their personal information, including home addresses, posted to Wikipedia for threatening purposes by a Democrat House staffer. Congressman Clay Higgins (R-La.) received threatening phone calls that led to a man's arrest. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kent.,\u00a0and his wife Kelly Paul have both received credible threats that have led to arrests. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas,\u00a0and his wife, as well as White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, were chased out of restaurants. Department\u00a0of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was confronted by protesters and harassed out of a DC restaurant. Rudy Peters, a Republican California Congressional candidate, was nearly stabbed while campaigning. My office has continued to receive threats against my life that have led to arrests. A female pro-life activist was violently assaulted by a man that has now been found guilty of eight counts of assault for this and similar incidents.  And this list goes on. The threats and the violence have not let up and instead of seeing my Democrat colleagues calling for an end, there have been calls for their supporters to keep going, to do even more to threaten Republicans More[7] Law Students Organize Nationwide 3-Day Walkout over Brett Kavanaugh[8] Is this is the kind of legal argument that the students of today's top laws schools make nowadays?These schools need to have their accreditations taken awayand parents should sue to get their money back Dave Tom Ciccotta Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Law students around the country are skipping class this week to protest Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court. Law students around the country are in the middle of a three-day walkout protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Starting on Wednesday, students at law schools around the country walked out of their classrooms at 2:15 p.m. with the intention of returning on Monday morning. The students believe their protest will encourage congressional\u00a0candidates to announce their commitment to impeaching recently confirmed Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Students at the law schools at American University, Duke University, Emory University, Georgetown University, New York University, and Temple University have signed on to participate[9] in the protest. In an open letter[10] on the StrikeAgainstKavanaugh.com, student organizers say that they don't believe Brett Kavanaugh is a 'legitimate' Supreme Court justice. The letter makes an unusual tie-in to America's history of brutality against Native Americans. We are in the middle of a national emergency. Brett Kavanaugh has been confirmed to the Supreme Court. We cannot accept a system that empowers a man who repeatedly lied under oath and a judiciary review process that only performs a sham of an investigation into his misconduct.\u00a0We do not recognize Kavanaugh as a legitimate member of the United States Supreme Court. As we announce this strike on Indigenous Peoples' Day, we recognize the ongoing harm indigenous people have suffered under the American legal system. The United States was borne out of conquest of indigenous people by European colonizers whose descendants became this country's founders. Since the Supreme Court's first case involving indigenous rights,\u00a0the Court has heard hundreds of cases and it has been grossly unjust to indigenous plaintiffs and defendants. Later this term, the Court could curtail the hunting rights of the Crow Tribes, rights which are 'central to [the] Tribes' subsistence, economy, culture, spiritual life, and day-to-day existence.' We do not believe that Kavanaugh will be a champion for indigenous peoples' rights, and fear the worst for the indigenous communities who have already faced so much harm from the Court. A local news report[11] from Wednesday revealed that students at Ohio State University's law school walked out of their classrooms at 11:10 a.m. to protest Kavanaugh's confirmation. Students told reporters that they believed that Dr. Ford's allegations were not taken seriously by members of Congress. Some said that they participated in the protest to bring attention to the ever-present issue of sexual assault More[12] UNC Asheville Professor Amanda Wray Arrested for Allegedly Stealing Conservative Political Signs[13]: A Professor at the University of North Carolina Asheville was arrested on Sunday and charged with a misdemeanor for stealing conservative political signs. Democrats Rage Against the Judiciary[14]: Their campaign against Kavanaugh failed, so they resort to smearing the Supreme Court itself. Jason L. Riley The Wall Street Journal Oct. 9, 2018  Protesters stand in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, Oct. 9 Brett Kavanaugh endured a Supreme Court confirmation ordeal like no other. He's now Justice Kavanaugh, but that doesn't mean the Democrats are done with him. Or even close to being done with him. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi wants the Federal Bureau of Investigation report on sexual-assault allegations, heretofore seen only by senators and staff, made public. Rep. Jerry Nadler, who's in line to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has vowed to reopen investigations into Justice Kavanaugh's background if Democrats win control of the House next month. Democrats aren't playing up talk of impeachment, but they haven't ruled it out. Mr. Nadler knows that an attempt to remove a justice from the Supreme Court, which requires a two-thirds supermajority in the Senate, would almost certainly fail. And Mrs. Pelosi is well aware that there are very good reasons why FBI background checks are confidential. Information gathered could be sensitive or embarrassing; much of it is hearsay; and people are less likely to speak openly and honestly with investigators in the future if they have to worry about being publicly identified. So, is any of this going anywhere? Not likely, but that's not the point of these exercises. The left is angry right now bordering on unhinged and Democrats hope stoking this rage will help get their voters to the polls on Nov. 6. The risk is that these continued attacks on Justice Kavanaugh's character and the promise of more to come might also boost Republican turnout. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell thanked Democrats and left-wing activist for mobilizing Republican voters, he was being sincere. Since the hearings, whatever voter-enthusiasm edge Democrats previously enjoyed has all but disappeared. Republicans in the Trump era are divided on some issues, but putting conservatives on the Supreme Court isn't one of them. If Democrats weren't so busy blaming Hillary Clinton's loss on the Russians, they might recall that Mr. Trump's campaign promise to nominate judges in the mold of the late Justice Antonin Scalia went a long way toward unifying his Republican support. Having lost the fight over Brett Kavanaugh, Democrats quickly pivoted to attacking the Supreme Court as an institution. After the confirmation vote Saturday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein tweeted that his appointment 'undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.' Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, another Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, added: 'The damage done today will be enduring to the United States Supreme Court to our country.' What's next, encouraging citizens to disregard certain rulings by certain justices?  Questioning the legitimacy of the court and undercutting confidence in the judicial branch is irresponsible and dangerous. The tactic recalls some of the ugliest periods in our nation's history, and today it's a mainstream Democratic talking point More[15] Kanye West Brings '4D Chess' to the White House: 'We Have to Release the Love'[16] Stay tuned as the Left's hair goes on fire[17] Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  President Donald Trump met with hip-hop superstar and fashion mogul Kanye West at the on Thursday and spoke to the media in the Oval Office. 'Trump is on his hero's journey right now,' West said. 'He might not have thought he'd have a crazy mother-fucker like Kanye West run up and support, but best believe   we are going to make America great.' West wore Trump's campaign MAGA hat, urging Americans to rally around the president. He said that the hat was his 'superman cape' allowing him to do whatever he wanted. 'We have to release the love throughout the entire country and give opportunities,' he said. Kanye West spoke for about 20\u00a0minutes, discussing his support for Trump and even took questions from reporters. 'I don't answer questions that are simple soundbites. You are tasting a fine wine, it has multiple notes to it,' he said. 'You better play 4D chess with me like Minority Report.' West talked about growing economic opportunities, rebuilding cities as well as race and culture issues. Trump praised Kanye's remarks, which had to be edited by TV censors before it was aired on cable news. 'He can speak for me any time he wants. He's a smart cookie,' he said. 'He gets it.' 'It was from the soul,' West replied, 'I just channeled it.' When reporters asked Trump if he believed that West could be a presidential candidate, Trump replied, 'Could very well be.' 'Only after, 2024,' West replied. The famous music star said he was proud to voice his support and gave the president a hug at the end of the meeting. 'I love this guy right here,' West said The video[18] Kanye West Stands by the Second Amendment: 'We Have the Right to Bear Arms'[19] Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Hip-hop superstar Kanye West defended the Second Amendment on Thursday, in a visit at the White House with President Donald Trump. West was asked reporters about gun violence in Chicago. 'The problem is illegal guns,' West replied. 'Illegal is the problem, not legal guns. We have the right to bear arms.' He said that there was a lot of hate building between police officers and the black community, but that the country also had to discuss black-on-black violence. 'As black people, we have to take a responsibility for what we're doing. We kill each other more than police officers,' he said More[20] Rapper T.I.: I Would Have Slapped 'A** Kissing' Kanye at that Trump Meeting[21] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Rapper T.I. said in an Instagram post that he would have slapped Kanye West in the face if he was at the White House meeting with President Trump Thursday. T.I. called Kanye West's meeting with Trump 'next level, futuristic Sambo ,Hopping Bob, Stephen off Django ass shit Ye!!!!' 'From what I can gather This is the most repulsive, disgraceful,\u00a0Embarrassing act of desperation auctioning off of one's soul to gain power I've ever seen,' he added. The Live Your Life rapper then said that he would have gotten violent with West if he were there. 'Now I recall you asking me to come with you to have this meeting and I declined (naturally) but bro if ain'time I would've been in there wit you and you behaved that spinelessly in my presence, I feel that I'd be compelled to slap de'Fuq outta you bro For the People!!!

Lemon said, 'I have no animosity for Kanye West. I'm just going to be honest, and I may get in a lot of trouble for it. I actually feel bad for him. What I saw was a minstrel show today him in front of all these white people, mostly white people embarrassing himself and embarrassing Americans but mostly African Americans because every one of them is sitting either at home or with their phones cringing.' He added, 'I couldn't even watch it. I had to turn the television off because it was so hard to watch the president of the United States exploiting him. And I don't mean this in a disparaging way, exploiting someone who needs help, who needs to back away from the cameras, who needs to get off stage, who needs to deal with his issues.'

Co-host Ali Velshi said, 'That was bonkers.' Ruhle stated, 'If you think you're going to get a thoughtful play-by-play and political analysis, you're not. Because that was an assault on our White House.'

Have a bunch of white liberals attack Kanye West Dave Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  While most media and entertainment elites are railing against hip-hop star Kanye West, Dave Chappelle, his longtime friend and creative collaborator is defending the vocal Trump support's right to speak out about his passions. In a sit-down interview scheduled to air on CNN at 7 p.m. EST Saturday, host Van Jones pressed Chappelle on what he thinks about West's newfound outspokenness toward the Democrat Party. 'First of all, you know, Kanye's an artist, man. He's a genius.' Chappelle said. 'I think the angle he's seeing things from is about the division that he sees. And he's not inconsistent with what he's saying,' Chappelle said,[42]\u00a0referring to West's\u00a0efforts to reclaim the\u00a0Confederate flag. West told a Los Angeles radio state in 2013 that he donned a jacket with a Confederate flag patch in a bid to adopt the flag.\u00a0'The Confederate flag represented slavery in a way, so I took the Confederate flag and made it my flag. It's my flag now,' West said. 'Now what you going to do?' Further, the veteran comedian told Jones that even though he doesn't always agree with West, he believes the rapper only has good intentions.\u00a0'I'm not mad at Kanye. That's my brother\u00a0  I love him, I support him,' Chappelle said[43]. 'But, you know, I don't have to agree with everything that he says.

The segment   which has been slammed as 'racist'  \u00a0began with Lemon asking if President Donald Trump is simply 'using Kanye as a prop to win over black voters before the midterms.' CNN political commentator Bakari Sellers responded with a jab at West: 'Anti-intellectualism simply isn't cool Kanye West is what happens when Negros don't read.' Sellers' remark prompted laughter from Lemon and fellow panelist Tara Setmayer, who followed up by saying West is 'the token negro of the Trump administration.' Walker, who has openly supported\u00a0Trump, is also an outspoken advocate for mental health issues - which were also mocked during the segment. Walker took to Twitter to express his disbelief. 'Went to bed appalled over Don Lemon's despicable behavior laughing at\u00a0Tara Setmayer and Bakari Sellers' awful remarks about Kanye West's visit with [Trump]! Woke up wondering why\u00a0CNN doesn't take all three off the air?' Walker tweeted, adding the hashtag\u00a0'#Shameful.' Setmayer fired back at Walker: 'Bless your heart You want to silence me because I expressed a different opinion than yours? Because I called out Kanye for what he is? Uninformed! I'm an actual conservative, who's worked on policy advancing those principles for 20-plus years. I'll never be a shill for Trump.' Walker - who has dabbled in mixed martial arts in addition to his iconic football career - isn't one to back down from a fight and quickly responded. 'NoTara Setmayer, anyone that is African American with an opinion different than yours, you want to call them out by using the N-word and Don Lemon is laughing?\u00a0To me that's bullying and shameful,' he tweeted back More[46] University of Georgia Protester to Candace Owens: 'You're Not Black'[47] Alana Mastrangelo Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle joined Charlie Kirk and Candace Owens on the second stop of Turning Point USA's Campus Clash tour Tuesday at the University of Georgia. The four spoke to an audience of 1,500 students and supporters, but one protester took issue with Owens' race. Among the crowd were protesters who seemed to take displeasure in the fact that Owens is a black conservative. 'You're not black!' Shouted one agitator while Owens explained why she left the Democrats. '[The Left] believes that someone loses their blackness as soon as they become a conservative,' reacted Kirk, 'They did this to Clarence Thomas, they did this to Dr. Ben Carson, and now they're doing this to Candace Owens.' 'Make no mistake, the Left believes that they own black people,' added Owens, 'So when a black person has the audacity to stand on stage and say I no longer agree with these policies, and I would like to think with my brain as opposed to my skin tone, they lose their minds.'

Discussing Melania Trump's 'Good Morning America' interview in which the pith helmet was sitting on a table beside her, co-host Whoopi Goldberg said, 'Can we talk about this gigantic white pith helmet up sitting in the shot, and it's really not a good thing to see because it represents a lot of stuff for folks, especially folks in Africa.' Meghan McCain said, 'So I brought this up because there's so many different elements to this. Number one, this is her first solo trip she did a press spray, which is when you're a politician standing in front of a group of reporters. She said, 'Concentrate on what I say, not what I wear.' But the problem is when you're wearing things like this, which is very charged because it's a symbol of British colonialism. My mother does a lot of philanthropy in Africa she travels there all the time never would be caught dead wearing this under these kind of circumstances and I think when I try and give Melania so much leg room and I really really really try with her, I just don't understand her fashion choices. And our first lady's fashion choices are political. It was political when Jackie O decided to wear a French designer instead of an American designer. The clothes that our first ladies wear are political choices. I just wish whoever is in change would maybe think a little more.'

Smith Met With Former Trump Adviser Michael Flynn in 2015[52] New email and interviews indicate the Republican operative who sought to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails had established a relationship with Mr. Flynn The Mueller investigation's attempts to find links of collusionbetween President Trump and Russiakeep getting more remote and improbable Instead of criminal behavior, the investigators will settle for tenuous innuendo When will this silliness end? Dave Shelby Holliday, Byron Tau and Dustin Volz The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  A veteran Republican activist whose quest to obtain Hillary Clinton's emails from hackers dominated the final months of his life struck up a professional relationship with Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser to President Trump, as early as 2015, and told associates during the presidential campaign that he was using the retired general's connections to help him on the email project. The late Peter W. Smith, an Illinois financier with a long history in Republican politics, met with Mr. Flynn in 2015, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time, Mr. Flynn had recently left his job as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and was trying to set up his own consulting firm, while Mr. Smith was looking at investment opportunities in cybersecurity.  Mr. Flynn was a top adviser to Mr. Trump during the 2016 campaign.

Richard Pinedo, who pleaded guilty in February to identity fraud, said in court he hadn't understood what sort of customers he was dealing with, and that his 'quiet, anonymous life' had been turned upside down by the case. The Russians who bought the information from Mr. Pinedo have been accused of mounting a broad effort to interfere in the 2016 election, the focus of Mr. Mueller's probe.  From 2014 through December 2017, prosecutors said, Mr. Pinedo sold anonymous customers hundreds of bank account numbers belonging to real people in order to help them circumvent PayPal[56] security protocols. 'I was convinced the services I was offering didn't hurt anyone,' the 28-year-old Mr. Pinedo said, reading quickly from a statement. Since the case was made public, he said, he has received hate-filled messages from strangers, some calling him a traitor to his country and others saying Russia would poison him for cooperating with the FBI. Mr. Pinedo, who lives with his family in Santa Paula, Calif., and was close to completing an associate degree in computer science, was one of the more unlikely defendants to be caught up in Mr. Mueller's inquiry. He earned money selling items on eBay[57] , and a dispute with PayPal over his account led him to offer services to help people evade the payment company's security measures, according to court documents. Among those who used his services were Russian nationals[58] who posted divisive social-media messages, invented fake personas and staged rallies with the strategic goal of sowing discord in American politics in 2016, prosecutors say More[59] Fusion GPS co-founder to take the Fifth to avoid testifying[60] Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 11, 2018 The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that produced the now-infamous Trump-Russia dossier, will invoke his First and Fifth Amendment privileges in order to avoid testifying before the House Judiciary Committee\u00a0next week, his lawyer said Thursday. The committee had subpoenaed Glenn Simpson to appear for a closed-door deposition last month after attorney Joshua Levy said his client would not participate voluntarily.\u00a0Simpson has previously sat for three congressional interviews as part of investigations into Russian activities during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In a letter to committee chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., Levy accused Republicans on the panel of trying to 'discredit and otherwise damage witnesses to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, all as part of an effort to protect' President Trump. Levy added that the committee 'has abdicated and indeed perverted its constitutional and traditional role' and shown 'abundant bad faith' toward Simpson More[61] MSNBC's Chris Hayes Claims, Without Evidence, Trump Taking 'Massive Bribes' from Saudi Arabia[62] Justin Caruso Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  MSNBC host Chris Hayes tweeted an unhinged conspiracy theory Wednesday night, suggesting that President Trump could be receiving 'massive bribes' from Saudis for his 'tacit approval' of them killing their critics. 'Would be nice to definitively rule out that the Saudis are paying the president massive bribes in exchange for tacit approval for murdering critics!' Chris Hayes tweeted 'And it would be easy to do: give Amer-icans some actual transparency into the president's personal and Trump Org finances,' he also wrote. Hayes is referencing the disappearance[63] of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian\u00a0Washington Post writer who was a critic of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Trump said[64] that he has reached out to Saudi Arabia for answers about Khashoggi's disappearance Wednesday. Hayes' Twitter presence regularly becomes unhinged. In September, Hayes sent a strange tweet seemingly comparing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to rape. 'So even though Dr Ford is saying please stop, slow down, I'm not comfortable with the way this is going, the GOP is gonna plow through, ignore her telling them to stop and just take what they think is rightfully theirs?' Hayes tweeted More[65] Turkey says it has video, audio of missing activist's murder at Saudi consulate, report says[66] Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 11, 2018 Turkish officials have told their American counterparts that they have audio and video recordings that prove writer and activist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post contributor, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul earlier this month, the paper reported late Thursday. The recordings would represent the first hard evidence to support the Ankara government's contention that a 15-member 'assassination squad' apprehended Khashoggi after he entered the consulate on Oct. 2, then killed him and dismembered his body. Previously published surveillance footage shows the 59-year-old Khashoggi entering the consulate. Saudi officials have claimed that he left the building by a different way and they do not know his whereabouts. The Post report[67], which cited officials from both the U.S. and Turkey, said that Khashoggi's voice can be heard on the recording along with voices of other men speaking Arabic. One official said men can be heard beating\u00a0Khashoggi on the recording, while another says the recording indicates how Khashoggi was 'interrogated, tortured and then murdered.' The report added that Turkish officials have balked at releasing the recordings out of fear it would compromise intelligence methods. Turkish media, including sources close to the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, have previously claimed that Saudi royal guards, intelligence officers, soldiers and an autopsy expert had been part of the team flown in on the day Khashoggi vanished. Khashoggi, who has repeatedly criticized the Saudi leadership in columns for the Post, had gone to the Istanbul\u00a0consulate to\u00a0get marriage paperwork as his fiancee waited outside. The fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, has led calls for the Trump administration to shed light on Khashoggi's fate. In an interview with 'Fox Friends' Thursday morning, Trump said that 'we have investigators over there and we're working with Turkey' and with Saudi Arabia on the case, but he provided no evidence or elaboration. Later in the day, Trump told reporters at the White House that 'if\u00a0it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation' besides canceling sales of U.S. weapons to the kingdom. An Erdogan spokesman told the state-run Anadolu Agency that Turkey and Saudi Arabia would form a 'joint working group' to look into the journalist's disappearance. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. was traveling to Saudi Arabia, and that the U.S. expects him to provide information about the Khashoggi case when he returns. She added that the U.S. had not requested the ambassador, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz, to leave The video and more[68] Turkey Provides New Links to Alleged Saudi Role in Dissident's Killing[69] A team of alleged Saudi assassins flew to Istanbul on a Gulfstream jet controlled by the Saudi crown prince, Turkish officials say Rory Jones in Dubai, Margherita Stancati in Riyadh and Summer Said in London The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  The Gulfstream jets that Turkish officials say ferried operatives who apprehended and likely killed a dissident Saudi journalist in Istanbul belong to a company controlled by Saudi Arabia's crown prince, people familiar with the matter said. Turkish authorities also released on Wednesday the names and photographs of the 15 men they say were involved in Jamal Khashoggi's suspected killing[70] in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 before returning hours later to Saudi Arabia. They included a forensics expert and a man who in 2017 was pictured wearing a Saudi Royal Guard uniform. Saudi officials have denied involvement and say they are assisting the Turkish investigation into Mr. Khashoggi's disappearance. Officials didn't respond to requests to comment. Mr. Khashoggi, a Washington resident living in self-imposed exile, was in Istanbul to obtain documents to marry his Turkish fianc\u00e9e when he disappeared, sparking a diplomatic crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, two influential regional rivals that are both U.S. allies.  President Trump said Wednesday he had spoken to Saudis 'at the highest level' about Mr. Khashoggi and planned to find out what happened to him. The White House said that other top administration officials national security adviser John Bolton, senior adviser Jared Kushner and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman about the issue by phone.  'This is a bad situation,' Mr. Trump told reporters. 'We cannot let this happen. To reporters, to anybody. We're going to get to the bottom of this,' he added More[71] US-Saudi relations hit snag over journalist's disappearance[72] Deb Riechmann and Jonathan Lemire Associated Press October 12, 2018 WASHINGTON - Sword dancers. Gleaming palaces. Military jets streaming red, white and blue trails. President Donald Trump soaked up the grandeur of Saudi Arabia on his first foreign stop as president last year and envisioned huge benefits for the United States in building closer ties with the repressive and oil-rich desert kingdom. Now, the White House relationship with Riyadh is imperiled over the mysterious disappearance of a Saudi writer, and the situation is creating friction between the Trump administration and members of Congress demanding to know if the columnist for The Washington Post was killed in the Saudi consulate in Turkey. Trump said he's talked to officials at the highest level of the kingdom and is 'demanding everything' to explain how Jamal Khashoggi, an activist who had been critical of Saudi leaders, vanished after he walked into the consulate in Istanbul to get documents he needed to get married. Turkish authorities claim Khashoggi, who resided in the United States, was killed by members of an elite Saudi 'assassination squad.' The kingdom describes the allegation as 'baseless.' But if Saudi Arabia is found to be complicit in his disappearance or death, the warm U.S.-Saudi relationship   and even hopes for Middle East peace   could be upended. Trump has backed Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious campaign to modernize the conservative kingdom and its economy. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who exchanges phone and text messages with the young crown prince, was instrumental in last year's deal to sell $110 billion in U.S. weapons to the kingdom. But even before Khashoggi vanished, concerns were mounting in Congress over Saudi Arabia's policies and the crown prince's aggressive steps to silence his critics. And now there are calls on Capitol Hill for the U.S. to halt arms sales to the kingdom, and Khashoggi's disappearance could galvanize more opposition from lawmakers and pressure Trump to rethink his relations with Saudi Arabia. Trump on Thursday pronounced U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia 'excellent' and said he doesn't want to scuttle arms deals with Riyadh because it means tens of millions of dollars pouring into the U.S. economy. He said the kingdom would simply buy the weapons from Russia or China instead. 'If it turns out to be as bad as it might be, there are certainly other ways of handling this situation,' he said without elaborating. Much of how the U.S. responds will depend on whether evidence surfaces that proves Saudi Arabia is responsible for Khashoggi's death. Trump will have to craft a 'calibrated response,' said Jon Alterman, who directs the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'He doesn't like that approach. The president likes complete wins.' The close ties between the Trump White House and the kingdom were in part forged by a friendship between two young princes: Last spring, Kushner and the crown prince met formally for the first time as a late-season snow fell outside the White House. The two men   both in their 30s, both trusted aides of older, familial leaders   struck a bond. As their countries' chief negotiators on Israeli-Palestinian peace, Kushner and the Saudi prince were both looking to make a name for themselves on the world stage and consulted with each other frequently over the following months. Kushner championed Crown Prince Mohammed to the president and senior foreign policy officials, some of whom expressed wariness at the embrace of MBS, as he is known in diplomatic circles More[73] U.S. Lawmakers Challenge Trump's Support for Saudi War In Yemen[74] Bipartisan group of senators seek answers from Secretary of State Pompeo over backing of Gulf allies Saudi behavior is making American allegiance untenable The wise course of action would be for us to treat Saudi Arabia the same way we treat IranWe should enforce a quarantine on both nationsand as they fall apart, from destroying each other and being torn apart internallywe should prevent Muslim 'refugees' from leaving those regions for the West If Islam is such a great 'complete way of life[75]'then is should do just fine without being propped upby Western commerce, aid, new inventions, and weapons Such a quarantine would reveal Islam's parasitic natureIslamic nations need money, inventions, and products from the Westwhile at the same time they seek to overthrow the West We don't have to defeat the Islamic world We need to isolate it and stop subsidizing itWithout the lifeblood of Western support, the Islamic world would die on the vine Dave Dion Nissenbaum The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  WASHINGTON U.S. lawmakers from both parties are challenging the Trump administration's support for Gulf allies battling Iran-aligned fighters in Yemen, putting new pressure on the U.S. president to scale back ties with Saudi Arabia during an especially sensitive time. A bipartisan group of senators plan to demand answers on Wednesday from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo after he backed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates[76] over the objections of most of his Yemen experts. In a letter delivered to Mr. Pompeo on Wednesday, the lawmakers, led by Sens. Todd Young (R., Ind.) and Jeanne Shaheen (D., N.H.), write that they have 'significant concerns' with his support for the Gulf allies.  'We find it difficult to reconcile known facts' with the decision to officially certify that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were taking meaningful steps to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen and that they were following the law when using weapons sold by the U.S. The certification was the first by Mr. Pompeo under a new law that requires him to certify to Congress every six months that the Gulf nations are doing all they can to minimize civilian casualties in Yemen The letter is part of an expanding effort in Congress to choke off American support for the two Gulf allies trying to contain a threat posed by Houthi fighters. The Saudi-led coalition has been trying to reinstall the head of the internationally recognized government, forced into exile when Houthi fighters seized Yemen's capital in 2015 More[77] Louisiana Man Gets 30 Months in Prison for Threatening Rep.

Dave Katherine Rodriguez Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  A Louisiana man was sentenced to 30 months in prison on Tuesday for calling in threats to Rep. Clay Higgins' (R-LA) district office in July 2017. U.S. District Judge\u00a0Dee Drell sentenced Sohail Rana, 50, of Lafayette, to 30 months in prison and 2 years of supervised release after he completes his sentence, the Justice Department announced[79] Wednesday. Prosecutors say Rana called Higgins' Lafayette district office on July 17, 2017, from Colorado threatening to end Higgins' career and his life. The district director took down Rana's phone number and\u00a0forwarded it to Higgins' chief of staff in Washington, DC, who then alerted authorities More[80] Amazon sent 'charity' donations to group led by 'hardcore Islamist,' report says[81] Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 8, 2018 Amazon has allowed its U.K. users to donate money to a group whose key figure has espoused hardline Islamist beliefs described as 'misogynistic, racist and homophobic' and called for a global Islamic caliphate, the Times of London reported Monday. The Muslim Research and Development Fund (MRDF) is one of several\u00a0groups that have received donations through Amazon Smile, which launched in the U.K. last year. Under the program, shoppers can select an organization which will receive 0.5 percent of the\u00a0purchase price of Amazon products. Haitham al-Haddad, the MRDF's founder and former chairman, has been called 'one of the most dangerous men in Britain' by the counter-extremist Quilliam Foundation due to his adherence to the Salafi movement within Sunni Islam. Terror groups such as Al Qaeda have embraced Salafism's tenants of jihad\u00a0across the\u00a0world. Amazon has allowed its U.K. users to donate money to the\u00a0Muslim Research and Development Fund, a group whose key figure has espoused beliefs described as 'misogynistic, racist and homophobic,' according to a report.  According to the Times, while Haddad has criticized terrorist attacks against 'innocent civilians,' he also has stated that Muslims ultimately will conquer 'the enemies of Islam' and establish a regime that will deploy the death penalty for adultery and refusing to follow the Muslim faith. 'I have received so many requests from western women who committed adultery,' the Times quoted Haddad as saying in 2012. 'They were begging me to help them to find a way to a Muslim country to be stoned to death.' Spokesmen for Haddad previously have said that his statements were taken out of context. Sara Khan, the British government's counter-extremism commissioner, told the paper that Haddad's views 'promote a supremacist 'us versus them'\u00a0worldview that wrongly makes Muslims feel that they can't be fully British.' In a statement obtained by Fox News, Amazon said it relied on a regulator, the Charity Commission for England and Wales, to determine which organizations were eligible to take part in Amazon Smile. 'If a charity no longer has charitable status because that organization supports, encourages or promotes intolerance or discrimination and has been removed from the Commission's register, we will remove them from the service,' the statement continued, adding that Amazon had 'referred these allegations to the Commission and will be conducting a full review to ensure they do not violate our policies.' More[82] Lawmakers Push to Rein In Tech Firms After Google+ Disclosure[83]  Exposure of users' private information on social-media service prompts calls from both parties for action  John D. McKinnon The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  WASHINGTON Top lawmakers of both parties argued Wednesday that Congress needs to take action to rein in big tech companies, citing revelations about Google+ as the latest example of questionable practices involving consumers' private information. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Google exposed the private data of hundreds of thousands of users of its Google+ social network. The company, a unit of Alphabet[84] Inc., GOOGL +1.75% [85]chose not disclose the issue earlier this year, in part because of worries that news of the incident would bring on regulatory scrutiny and reputational damage[86], according to interviews and documents. At a Senate hearing Wednesday, Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune (R., S.D.) said it is increasingly clear from Google+ as well as Facebook[87] Inc.'s earlier Cambridge Analytica scandal that industry self-regulation is no longer sufficient to protect users' privacy. 'A national standard for privacy rules of the road is needed to protect consumers,' Mr. Thune said. He warned that given previous congressional struggles with the issue, all sides must keep 'open minds' about the contours of a bipartisan bill.  The Federal Trade Commission is probing an incident in which data of up to 50 million Facebook users was transferred to Cambridge Analytica[88], a data firm that worked for President Trump during the 2016 campaign More[89] U.S. Detains Alleged Chinese Spy It Says Tried to Steal GE Trade Secrets[90]  Yanjun Xu, arrested in Belgium and extradited this week, is an official of China's Ministry of State Security, Justice Department says Aruna Viswanatha The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  An alleged Chinese intelligence operative arrested in Belgium has been brought to the U.S. and charged with conspiring to steal trade secrets from GE Aviation and other companies, marking a rare break for the U.S. in its increasingly aggressive effort to target Chinese industrial spying.  Prosecutors have previously charged Chinese government officials with economic espionage and hacking-related offenses pointing to state-directed efforts to steal U.S. technology, but have never publicly identified anyone in custody as a Chinese intelligence officer. The arrested man, Yanjun Xu, made an initial appearance in federal court in Ohio on Wednesday.  'This case is not an isolated incident. It is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense,' John Demers, the head of the Justice Department's national-security division, said in announcing the charges More[91] University of Michigan Bans Professors from Withholding Support to Pro-Israel Students[92] Tom Ciccotta Breitbart News 11 Oct 2018  The University of Michigan is acting now to prevent professors from refusing support to students with opposing political views. In September, Breitbart News reported[93] on University of Michigan Professor John Cheney-Lippold, who refused to write a letter of recommendation for a student that was looking to study abroad in Israel. 'I am very sorry, but I only scanned your first email a couple weeks ago and missed out on a key detail,' Cheney-Lippold wrote in an email to the student. 'As you may know, many university departments have pledged an academic boycott against Israel in support of Palestinians living in Palestine. This boycott includes writing letters of recommendation for students planning to study there.' Last week, another professor at the University of Michigan refused[94] to write a letter of recommendation for a student looking to study abroad in Israel. In a statement[95] that was published on Tuesday, University of Michigan President\u00a0Mark S. Schlissel argued that it is unacceptable to withhold recommendation letters based on a student's personal beliefs. Two U-M students were recently denied promised letters of recommendation for academic programs based on the personal views of two individuals with instructional responsibilities. The students were applying to study in Israel. Withholding letters of recommendation based on personal views does not meet our university's expectations for supporting the academic aspirations of our students. Conduct that violates this expectation and harms students will not be tolerated and will be addressed with serious consequences. Such actions interfere with our students' opportunities, violate\u00a0their\u00a0academic freedom and betray our university's educational mission. The statement ends with a commitment from Schlissel that professors will support students regardless of their personal beliefs. 'We will work to make absolutely clear that faculty members' personal political beliefs cannot interfere with their obligations to our students with regard to letter-writing and all other modes of academic support,' he writes in the statement More[96] Tucker Carlson: 'Ship of Fools' - How Democrats lost their minds over immigration[97] Tucker Carlson Fox News October 11, 2018 The other day I watched a group of young lefties protest the Trump administration's immigration policies. They were carrying Mexican flags and screaming: 'Si, se puede!' Yes we can.\u00a0'Si, se puede' is now the rallying cry of the no-borders left, but it wasn't always. The slogan first became famous fifty years ago, thanks to Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers union. When Chavez said 'Si, se puede,' he meant something very different: 'yes, we can seal the borders.'  Cesar Chavez hated immigration. He was Hispanic and left wing, but he called illegal Mexican immigrants 'wetbacks,' and fought to keep them out of the country. He understood that peasants from Latin America will always work for less than Americans will. That's why employers prefer them. Immigration undercut his members' wages and weakened the union. 'As long as we have a poor country bordering California,' Chavez once explained, 'it's going to be very difficult to win strikes.' In California, Chavez remains a progressive hero. There's a state holiday named after him, and at least 25 public schools. Chavez's life is a reminder of how much the left has changed, and how quickly. For a century, many Democrats agreed with Chavez. They opposed mass immigration because they believed it hurt American workers. As a factual matter, they were right. One study, conducted after the 1980 Mariel boatlift in Miami, found that high school educated Americans saw their wages fall by more than a third after large numbers of Cuban refugees arrived. If you believe in supply and demand, this isn't surprising Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware agreed; he introduced federal legislation to curb the arrival of the Vietnamese. Even George McGovern, maybe the most liberal Democrat in the Senate, opposed bringing more refugees into the country. 'I think the Vietnamese are better off in Vietnam,' McGovern said As late as 2006, there were still liberals who cared about the economic effects of immigration. 'Immigration reduces the wages of domestic workers who compete with immigrants,' explained economist Paul Krugman in the New York Times. 'We'll need to reduce the inflow of low-skill immigrants.' That same year, Hillary Clinton voted for a fence on the Mexican border. So did Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, and 23 other Senate Democrats.  But that was the last gasp of a dying elite consensus. Twenty years after Bill Clinton told Americans they had the right to be upset about illegal immigration, his wife scolded the country for enforcing border controls. The 2016 Democratic platform demanded that all illegal immigrants living in the United States be, 'incorporated completely into our society through legal processes.' It was now Democratic Party orthodoxy not simply to let illegal aliens stay in the country, but to let them vote.  What changed? Not the economics of immigration Here's the short answer, in four simple facts:  There are likely more than 22 million illegal aliens within our borders. Democrats plan to give them all citizenship.\u00a0It's in their platform. Studies show the overwhelming majority of first-time immigrant voters vote Democrat. The biggest landslide in American presidential history was only 17 million votes.  Do the math. The payoff for Democrats is obvious: a permanent electoral majority and total control of the country for generations.\u00a0That's the point, no matter what they tell you. From their perspective, it's well worth destroying the middle class The video and more[98] Top U.K. Court Sides With Bakers Who Refused Gay Man's Order[99]  The man wanted a cake decorated with the message 'Support Gay Marriage,' but court says that impinged on bakers' rights to free speech The reversals of the Left that have taken place since President Trump's electionare now reverberating around the worldechoing conservative victories over Leftist causes in the United States The jig is up The Left has tipped its handand exposed the narratives of 'inclusiveness' and 'multiculturalism'to be little more than cudgels for beating down mainstream Western society Dave Max Colchester The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  LONDON Britain's top court Wednesday upheld the right of a bakery to refuse a gay man's order for a cake decorated with the message 'Support Gay Marriage' on the grounds that forcing the bakers to make the cake would have impinged on their rights to free speech. Following a yearslong legal case that cost over half a million dollars, Britain's top court ruled the case wasn't about discrimination but rather boiled down to a different issue that people can refuse to promote messages they disagree with. In May 2014, Gareth Lee ordered a cake from Ashers, a bakery in Northern Ireland, for an event organized to campaign for same-sex marriage. In Northern Ireland, unlike in the rest of the U.K., same-sex marriage isn't currently legally recognized. Mr. Lee ordered a cake iced with a depiction of the Sesame Street characters Bert and Ernie and the words 'Support Gay Marriage.' The owners of Ashers refused to make the cake on the grounds that they didn't want to endorse same-sex marriage because it was against their religious beliefs. British judges found in the bakers' favor on the grounds that they weren't discriminating against Mr. Lee for being gay but were objecting to putting a message they didn't agree with on the cake More[100] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: Trump and Steve Scalise Talk Eric Holder's Threatening Rhetoric; Kanye Talks Love; More[101] appeared first on Western Free Press[102].

And yes, civilian lives are at riskbut who can tell the civilians from the al Qaeda members??? Al Qaeda has a long history of blending in civiliansso we are now putting ourselves in the position of coming to the defense of al Qaeda It would be stupid to do this Also, note that Syria is planning a gas attackWHAT?</p><p>! Obama's gang assured us that they had reached an agreement with Assadwhere he removed such chemical weapons[2] Is Obama ever going to be held accountable? Dave Edmund DeMarche Fox News September 10, 2018 President Bashar al-Assad has approved a gas attack in the Idlib province, which is the country's last rebel stronghold, a report on Sunday said. Reports of Assad's approval comes about a week after President Trump warned the strongman[3] and his allies not to 'recklessly attack' the province. Trump called any gas attack a potential 'grave humanitarian mistake.' U.N. officials believe an offensive on Idlib would trigger a wave of displacement that could uproot an estimated 800,000 people and discourage refugees from returning home. The U.S. and France have warned an Idlib offensive would trigger a humanitarian crisis and warned that a chemical attack in Idlib would prompt a western retaliation. The Wall Street Journal reported[4] that the international pressure did little to sway Assad, who benefits from support from Russia and Iran. The report said Assad has approved the use of chlorine gas. For Russia and Iran, both allies of the Syrian government, retaking Idlib is crucial to complete what they see as a military victory in Syria's civil war after Syrian troops recaptured nearly all other major towns and cities, largely defeating the rebellion against Assad. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen! \u2014 Donald J.

Trump Cuts $25 Million in Aid for Palestinians in East Jerusalem Hospitals[8] He who pays the piper calls the tune, and the man paying the piper is President Trump Palestinians rage against the United States[9] and kill Americans[10], as well as attack Israel[11], a key ally They have turned peace negotiations into a bad joke[12] Why should they expect us to give them hundreds of millions of dollars each year? If they want American money, they need to start acting like an ally and not an enemy Dave Reuters Independent Journal Review Sep 9, 2018  U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered that $25 million earmarked for the care of Palestinians in East Jerusalem hospitals be directed elsewhere as part of a review of aid, a State Department official said on Saturday. Trump called for a review of U.S. assistance to the Palestinians earlier this year to ensure that the funds were being spent in accordance with national interests and were providing value to taxpayers. 'As a result of that review, at the direction of the President, we will be redirecting approximately $25 million originally planned for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network,' the State Department official said. 'Those funds will go to high-priority projects elsewhere.' The aid cut is the latest in a number of actions by the Trump administration that have alienated the Palestinians, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. That move reversed longtime U.S. policy and led Palestinian leadership to boycott Washington peace efforts led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law. Last month, the Trump administration said it would redirect $200 million in Palestinian economic support funds for programs in the West Bank and Gaza. And at the end of August, the Trump administration halted all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), a decision that further heightened tensions with the Palestinian leadership. Palestinian refugees have reacted with dismay to the funding cuts, warning they would lead to more poverty, anger and instability in the Middle East. A statement from the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the latest aid cut was part of a U.S. attempt 'to liquidate the Palestinian cause' and said it would threaten the lives of thousands of Palestinians and the livelihoods of thousands of hospital employees. 'This dangerous and unjustified American escalation has crossed all red lines and is considered a direct aggression against the Palestinian people,' it said One of the centers, Al Makassed Islamic Charitable Society Hospital, said in statement the U.S. aid cuts come as the 'hospital is going through a suffocating crisis as a result of the lack of flow of financial aid, and the piling up of debts and funds held back by the Palestinian government'. It said it had received 45 million shekels ($12.5 million) of the U.S. money to treat patients from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. In the statement hospital CEO Dr. Bassam Abu Libdeh 'questioned the justification behind mixing political issues with medical and humanitarian issues.'

The Trump administration is reportedly set to announce the closing of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Washington, D.C., in a bid to pressure the Palestinian leadership to participate in Middle East peace efforts. According to theWall Street Journal[15], national security adviser John Bolton is expected to make the announcement on Monday. 'The United States will always stand with our friend and ally, Israel,' Bolton is expected to say, according to the prepared remarks. 'The Trump administration will not keep the office open when the Palestinians refuse to start direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.'

Harold Hutchison Patriot Post Sep. 7, 2018  The anonymous New York Times op-ed[18] from a 'senior administration official' has generated a lot of heat, but it does seem overblown. Among that author's complaints is how President Donald Trump is dealing with NATO and NAFTA. So what's the real scoop behind Trump's purportedly 'dangerous' threat to pull out of the alliance and the trade agreement? Let's start by acknowledging that we have these powerful trade chips only because this president is willing to question how the status quo benefits America. As for NATO, its purpose was to deter aggression from the Warsaw Pact (really the Soviet Union and a collection of puppet states). Since the fall of the USSR, the alliance's defenses have badly dwindled. This order of battle[19] (it's a Word document) shows just how numerically superior the NATO military was in 1989. Today, the forces NATO can send are fewer in numbers, and there are significant problems[20] with readiness. Then there's the factor of Russia having geopolitical kompromat[21] on some of our NATO allies. No wonder Trump has been delivering some tough messages[22] to Canada and Germany for their lack of readiness. How bad is it? Germany's 'green' jet fuel grounded its fleet of Tornado attack jets, and Canada needed to borrow a replenishment oiler from Chile. This type of nonsense is what President Trump is dealing with. The previous strategy of nicely asking allies to address the growing decline of NATO simply failed. Even our closest allies, like the United Kingdom, were dropping capabilities left and right. It was time to hit them with a figurative two-by-four. The same applied to NAFTA. Mexico and Canada had been ripping off American workers in some areas, notably in the production of automobiles. Trump used the threat of an American pullout to get Mexico to come to the table to renegotiate NAFTA. Now, he's using hardball to get Canada to rethink its barriers for dairy products, among other things. This isn't to say that playing hardball is coming without figurative casualties. On the contrary \u2014 standing up for oneself often involves short-term pain, whether the opponent is a schoolyard bully or a trading partner. Those who think Trump is reckless should take a look at how Ronald Reagan handled arms control. He was willing to go for the complete elimination of a class of nuclear weapons, but when the Soviets wouldn't negotiate in good faith, he improved our nation's nuclear arsenal. Eventually, the Soviets caved and negotiated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (which they are now cheating on[23]) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Back then, there was a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth that Reagan would start a global thermonuclear war. Much of it was from Democrats and what was then the establishment Republicans More[24] Anti-Trump journalists find new, bizarre ways to join the resistance[25] Dan Gainor Fox News September 9, 2018 It's all about monetizing 'the resistance' and getting a piece of the 'hate Trump' action Dave Media bias seems to get worse by the week. Even a work week shortened by Labor Day delivered on that depressing trend. Journalists cheered protests at the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh and swallowed a silly Internet hoax. Then there was the anonymous New York Times op-ed defending a 'steady state' rebellion against President Trump. It was a new low for journalists devoted to overturning a democratic election. Call it the pice de rsistance. The New York Times trumped opposition leaders at CNN and The Washington Post. The three battle daily for liberal attention and journalistic kudos like unhinged 'Bachelorette' finalists, each desperate to win favor.  The op-ed[26] let the Times celebrate victory for now. It easily passed the Post with its snoozy new Bob Woodward book[27] and CNN's celebration for taking down InfoWars chief Alex Jones[28]. The Times said publishing an anonymous op-ed is a 'rare step.' So rare, no one in journalism remembered anyone else doing it to attack the president of the United States. But then, we've only had President Donald J. Trump for about 20 months. The op-ed brought out more insanity. MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace[29] fantasized about removing Trump and said it was time for 'a serious debate about the 25th Amendment in this country.' Fellow host Ari Melber combined with his guests to call the administration a 'dumpster fire' 11 times[30] in one segment. Things were just as bad over at CNN. 'Wolf' host Wolf Blitzer[31] kept asking if America was heading to a 'constitutional crisis,' as if a Times op-ed equaled the rule of law 'CBS This Morning' fill-in co-host Bianna Golodryga was a rare voice of reason[32] about the op-ed. She worried it would exacerbate America's 'erosion of trust' in journalism. She's right. 2. 'No, I'm Spartacus': If the op-ed provided the drama for the week, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Kavanaugh provided almost everything else - from comedy to farce. Journalists loved how Democrats turned the hearing into a circus, complete with hundreds of arrests and women dressed in outfits[33] straight out of Hulu's pro-abortion dystopia 'The Handmaid's Tale.'[34] There were breathless reports [35]of 'chaos' or 'fireworks' but at least it was 'dramatic' enough to keep journalists happy. In reality, it was a 'was all carefully choreographed,'[36] reported ABC's Terry Moran, as Senate Democrats and their most-unhinged allies created a scene[37] they hope will aid them in the midterms, after Kavanaugh is already sitting on the Supreme Court That wasn't even the best part. The left flipped out over former Kavanaugh clerk Zina Bash, who they claimed flashed an 'OK' sign during the hearing. (Hint: She didn't.) 'The gesture was declared a white-power symbol and 'a national outrage' by a #resistance tweeter who has 200,000 followers,' wrote Politico [38]and coverage of the left's 'Self-Own' went downhill from there 3. Obama's Back: There is no one the media adore more than President Obama Now Obama has returned and journalists have visions of a rainbow-hued Camelot once more dancing in their heads. He spoke in Illinois Friday criticizing Trump and said[39] 'the politics of resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.' The media have been pretending that is true for years, so they loved it. CNN depicted the battle as 'Obama and Trump fight for America's soul.' [40]CNN host and former Obama green jobs czar[41] Van Jones loved it and explained how 'democracy is at risk.' Fellow host Brooke Baldwin called the speech 'incredible.' And Politico was giddy, claiming[42] in a headline: 'Obama vs. Trump: The clash everyone's waited for arrives.' By 'everyone,' what Politico meant was 'journalists.'

In the same interview[56] with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's 'GPS,' however, Kerry suggested that the country is in the midst of a 'genuine constitutional crisis' because President Trump is not capable of performing his job.

The action emails encouraged NYU officials to properly discipline the professor. However, NYU and many of its trustees started blocking the form emails sent through Florida Family Association's email server. Florida Family Association responded by sending out new alerts during the week of July 16, 2018 with the action email formatted to be sent through each subscribers' own email client. Unfortunately, after more than a month, it appears that NYU has declined to discipline Professor Sam Lavigne for posting personal information that put ICE employees' and their families' safety at risk. His doxxing could have resulted in physical harm to ICE employees and their families. Now that the information is out there it still could result in harm. NYU would very likely have immediately terminated any staff member if he or she were a conservative who published personal information on people who are on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Sam Lavigne's outrageous doxxing of law enforcement personnel cried out for strong disciplinary action. However, NYU's bias prevented it from applying equal discipline and in this case justice for the ICE employees. NYU Professor Sam Lavigne[62] created a data base on 1,595 ICE employees using personal information posted at LinkedIn. Lavigne shared the information with his 3,600 Twitter followers in an effort to doxx the ICE employees.

But most of the two billion Mastercard holders aren't aware of this behind-the-scenes tracking. That's because the companies never told the public about the arrangement. Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Mastercard Inc. brokered a business partnership during about four years of negotiations, according to four people with knowledge of the deal, three of whom worked on it directly.The alliance gave Google an unprecedented asset for measuring retail spending, part of the search giant's strategy to fortify its primary business against onslaughts from Amazon.com Inc. and others. But the deal, which has not been previously reported, could raise broader privacy concerns about how much consumer data technology companies like Google quietly absorb. 'People don't expect what they buy physically in a store to be linked to what they are buying online,' said Christine Bannan, counsel with the advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). 'There's just far too much burden that companies place on consumers and not enough responsibility being taken by companies to inform users what they're doing and what rights they have.' Google paid Mastercard millions of dollars for the data, according to two people who worked on the deal, and the companies discussed sharing a portion of the ad revenue, according to one of the people. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. A spokeswoman for Google said there is no revenue sharing agreement withits partners. A Google spokeswomandeclined to comment on the partnership with Mastercard, but addressed the ads tool.'Before we launched this beta product last year, we built a new, double-blind encryption technology that prevents both Google and our partners from viewing our respective users' personally identifiable information,' the company said in a statement.'We do not have access to any personal information from our partners' credit and debit cards, nor do we share any personal information with our partners.'

The actor, who's among the richest in Hollywood, made the remarks after Maher pointed out that Republicans criticize socialist and progressive Democrats by invoking the example of Venezuela, a failing socialist regime where thousands of Venezuelans flee every week amid dire living conditions. 'But that word\u2014the Democrats need to get a plan to fight this slander of, 'Socialism, you're going to be living in Venezuela,'' said Maher. 'And I don't see it yet.'

COO Joseph Ianniello was announced as president and acting CEO 'while the Board conducts a search for a permanent successor.' The network also announced that it and Moonves would donate $20 million to organizations that support 'that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.' The $20 million would come out of any compensation Moonves is due to receive following the conclusion of an ongoing investigation into the allegations against him.

Jordan Candler Patriot Post Sep. 6, 2018  As corroborated by their incessant political theater, the dueling top interests of Democrat thespians are gun control and abortion, both of which they consider sacrosanct \u2014 to the point that these issues compete with each other as the litmus test[75] for judicial nominees. Therefore, no off-the-rocker rhetoric is off limits if it means Democrats succeed in ratcheting up tension and obstruction. The most outlandish bout of political theater on abortion this week occurred while Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was lecturing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 an originalist whose jurisprudence doesn't bode well for judicial despotism like Roe v. Wade. On Wednesday, Feinstein ridiculously asserted, 'In the 1950s and '60s, the two decades before Roe, deaths from illegal abortions in this country ran between 200,000 and 1.2 million. So, a lot of women died.' These numbers were supposedly obtained from the Guttmacher Institute, but as the Washington Examiner's Becket Adams reveals[76], Feinstein was spewing fake news: 'The Guttmacher Institute has reported no such thing. What Sen. Feinstein claimed during Wednesday's hearing is either her own ignorant misreading of the institute's reporting or it's an intentional, outright lie.' Instead, Guttmacher reports, 'Estimates of the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. One analysis, extrapolating from data from North Carolina, concluded that an estimated 829,000 illegal or self-induced abortions occurred in 1967.' Feinstein is conflating two very distinct things \u2014 the estimated number of unlawful abortions every year before they became legal, and maternal deaths. So her assertion this week that up to 1.2 million mothers died because abortion wasn't yet legal \u2014 and therefore hazardous to the mother \u2014 is a fabrication More[77] At Kavanaugh hearing, Cory Booker tells Republicans threatening his expulsion to 'bring it'[78] While Freedom Update has covered Cory Booker's antics beforewe hadn't seen a video of what he actually said Now you can see him carry on for yourself What Booker did was more than just foolish He deliberately tried to incite a revolt by inventing a conflict out of thin airdesigned to create a narrative that repressive conservativeswere keeping the truth about Kavanaugh's racism from the American people This is just the kind of narrative that would feed the Democratic Socialist worldview While we can be relieved that Booker was exposed as a phony[79]the mere fact that he attempted this fraud to gain power is unsettling We should expect more such antics from Democratic Socialistsas well as long-time Democrats trying to hold their seatsas their constituents lurch to the Left(or rather, as centrist Dems defect to the Republican Party) Democrats are desperate because President Trump's policies are serving the country wellThey would rather sow discord, division, and chaos than lose poweror admit that big government solutions don't work Dave Christopher Wilson Yahoo News September 6, 2018 The Supreme Court[80] confirmation hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh turned into a fight over Senate rules Thursday morning, with arguments about the release of confidential documents and threats of the possible expulsion of some members. 'Bring it,' said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in response to a threat made Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that he could be expelled from the Senate if he released documents marked 'confidential' to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'Then apply the rule and bring the charges.' Booker said that he was 'knowingly violating the rules' of the Senate and releasing documents that were only made available to senators this week, just before the hearings started. Booker said he would be releasing a document related to Kavanaugh and racial profiling that contained no personal information and was not a national security threat. Booker's office later released the document (read it here[81]) in which Kavanaugh was critical of some Department of Transportation affirmative action policies. 'The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside,' wrote Kavanaugh in the 2003 email. Cornyn said Booker's possible 2020 presidential aspirations were his motivation for releasing the document, adding that no senator deserved to sit on the committee if they wanted to be a law unto themselves. The debate centered on documents that were marked confidential by Bill Burck, a former George W. Bush White House staffer and Kavanaugh deputy. Democrats have stated that they didn't have time to go over the documents and that there is a conflict in interest by Burke. Some of the documents were leaked to the New York Times on Wednesday evening, including one 2003 email in which Kavanaugh questioned whether Roe v. Wade was settled law of the land. Women's health advocates have said that Kavanaugh[82] would overturn the ruling and criminalize abortions. A number of Democrats on the committee then stepped forward to say they would also share any consequences suffered by Booker for releasing Kavanaugh's emails. 'If there's going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in,' said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. 'Count me in, too,' said Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, who said she was releasing a document to the press and would 'defy anyone reading this document that to be able to conclude that this should be deemed confidential in any way, shape or form.' Hirono later released the documents[83], about programs for Native Hawaiians, on Twitter. 'All of us are ready to face that rule on the bogus designation of committee confidential,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. 'Just because there's a Senate rule doesn't mean it can be misapplied, misconstrued or misused. And I think even the threat raised by one of my colleagues here is misfortunate \u2014 and that is a kind way of putting it, will all due respect.' Cornyn then cited Senate Rule 29.5, which says that any senator who discloses confidential or secret Senate business could suffer expulsion from the body. At that point, Booker repeatedly told Cornyn to 'bring it' and that he would accept the consequences of his actions. Burck told the Washington Post[84] Thursday afternoon that he had cleared Booker's documents on Wednesday night, adding'We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly.' The video and more[85] 'I Am Schmuck-acus.'[86]  What was Corey Booker really up to? Now we know Dave Jim Geraghty National Review September 7, 2018  'This is about the closest I'll have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,' New Jersey senator Cory Booker declared during yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in one of the lamer and less convincing efforts by an aspiring presidential candidate to give himself a cool nickname. Alas, Booker's lame stunt \u2014 announcing that he would defy Senate rules and release confidential documents, and daring the Republicans to expel him, only to later find that the documents had been cleared for release \u2014 is getting an exceptionally sympathetic assessment from the mainstream media. Here's the Washington Post's description: Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), soon joined by other Democrats, released documents he said were marked confidential. There's some dispute as to whether, at the time Booker released an email chain of Kavanaugh talking about his views on racial profiling, they were actually still confidential. Aides on both sides of the aisle said they were set for release Thursday morning. Then what, exactly, is the dispute? If aides on both sides agree that the documents were set for release Thursday morning, then they weren't confidential, now were they? Cory Booker is walking up to the free-sample tray and announcing to everyone that it's shoplifting. Booker boasted that he was willing to risk expulsion from the Senate, with way too much 'don't throw me into that briar patch' tone. For starters, Article I, Section 5, of the United States Constitution says, 'Each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.' You're not going to get two-thirds of the U.S. Senate to expel Booker \u2014 although Democrats might vote to keep Booker around for a different reason than you might think. Cory Booker seriously wants to be the next president, and right now, a day job in the Senate is a hindrance. For a while, the day job gave him a platform for publicity stunts, like fiercely denouncing the man he praised and cosponsored legislation with just two years earlier[87], or calling the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh 'evil[88].' (Notice how quickly everyone forgot about that? These publicity stunts and over-the-top rhetoric are political junk food, with little-lasting effect or consequence.) But serving in the Senate has now become a time commitment that keeps Booker away from where he wants to be: campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, etcetera before the small army of rival candidates descends upon those states. It's also difficult to stand out in the Senate; right now at least six of Booker's colleagues are also thinking about running in 2020: Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota[89], Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Jeff Merkley of Oregon[90], Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. (Don't feel bad, I had forgotten about Klobuchar and Merkley too.) If you're Booker, why not end your Senate career with a bang, pose as a martyr to those secretive, nasty Republicans, and get a couple months head start on the rest of the Democratic field? The problem for Booker is that so far, no one's taking the bait. The only person talking about expelling Cory Booker is Cory Booker More[91] Taxpayers paid LAPD detail to guard California Sen.

It is becoming evident that social justice warriorsof the Democratic Socialist party believe their mission is so importantthat they transcend those despised symbols of the White-Male hegemonyotherwise known as laws Dave Teri Webster The Blaze September 8, 2018 Taxpayers paid for armed, plain-clothes Los Angeles police officers to accompany U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to public events and media appearances, KNBC-TV reported[93]. How much was spent? The TV station obtained records showing expenses that include airline tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, and meals. The total cost reached beyond $28,000, without including the officers' overtime. Although the Los Angeles Police Department regularly provides security for security for dignitaries and other officials in the city, extending that role to a senator traveling to other cities is 'unprecedented,' the report stated. Mayor Eric Garcetti's office reportedly said the Mayor was unaware of the arrangement, which was shut down in July by new LAPD Chief Michel Moore. 'It was not until Chief Moore was sworn in, conducted a new assessment of the threat, determined that this arrangement was no longer needed, and informed Mayor Garcetti, that the mayor became aware of the state-wide detail,' Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar wrote in a statement to the TV station. Garcetti indicated former LAPD Chief Charlie Beck was solely responsible for the program. 'Chief of Police Charlie Beck assigned a security detail for US Senator Kamala Harris shortly before she was sworn into office in 2017, based on a threat assessment he believed to be credible,' LAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein told the news outlet. 'Funding for the detail was provided by the Department budget.' More[94] Kamala Harris's $50,000 LAPD guards not her first corruption rodeo[95] So corrupt So unhinged Dave Monica Showalter American Thinker September 10, 2018 California's Sen. Kamala Harris, the leftist Democratic presidential wannabe who got herself in the news after piously posturing against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, has now been caught with her hand in the till, traipsing around California with a Los Angeles Police Department bodyguard detail in tow, at a taxpayer-paid cost of nearly $50,000. NBC4 of Los Angeleshas the details[96]: 'Armed, plain-clothes LAPD officers were dispatched to California cities outside of Los Angeles at least a dozen times to provide security for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris at public events, media appearances, and a party. LA taxpayers paid for airline tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, and meals, according to detailed expense reports obtained by NBC News. The total cost of the trips, not including the officers' overtime, topped $28,000.' The $28K was just a starting point in the cost extravaganza - overtime and other expenses made the total close to $50K. A new police chief found out about the unprecedented freebie from the people of Los Angeles and put a stop to it. The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, says he never heard of it and laid the blame squarely on recently retired LAPD chief Charlie Beck. One thing is certain: it's never been done before. But this being Harris, it's not surprising it happened. Harris, per this Mother Jonesbiography[97], is a former California attorney general with a radical upbringing, who viewed her prosecutorial career not as a means of putting crooks in jail to protect communities, but as a means of long marching through the institutions[98] - corrupting them from within by taking them over in the name of left-wingery. Everything was political for her, including her political rise as the mistress of California swamp thing extraordinaire, former State Assembly speaker, and San Francisco mayor Willie Brown. As a prosecutor, she's engaged in some pretty impressive politically motivated corner-cutting. She falsified a confession transcript[99]of a defendant and then, when she was caught, defended it. She's been caught makingphony charges of racism[100]about her Berkeley upbringing, as if Berkeley in the 1970s were a den of Klansmen. She has anarmy of fake Twitter followers[101] in an obvious bid to make herself look more influential than she really is. Lately, she put out a deceptively edited video to smearKavanaugh[102]. So no surprise to see her accepting an emolument from the politically correct and easy to shake down LAPD for free stuff. Stuff other candidates have to pay for. Stuff that costs taxpayers big bucks and creates lots of importance and prestige for herself Garcetti lays the whole scandal at the feet of LAPD former chief Charlie Beck, and sure enough, the pair of them go way back. Harris got elected attorney general in 2009, and Beck was the cop chief trying to avoid her politically correct prosecutorial gaze as he toed her political correctness line More[103] Whining Serena Williams is tennis's Hillary Clinton[104] Things didn't turn out how she wanted\u2014 so she had a tantrum at the umpire. How classy! The social justice warrior mindset is spreading from politics throughout the culture Read how it provided space for Serena Williams to act like a complete jerkand expect to get away with itwith a large crowd of SJWs cheering her on, rules be damned Why? Because the rules are sexist, or racist, or somethingWho cares if her opponent was a Japanese-Haitian woman?! Down with the system!!! Dave Roger Kimball Spectator USA September 9, 2018 Your actual identity doesn't matteras long as you identify with the correct identityand accuse your opponents of being in league with the wrong identityIt's all so simple, isn't it? Dave No one expected Naomi Osaka to win the US Open yesterday. Everyone favoured her opponent. The crowd was solidly with Serena Williams, as were the bookies. But the 20-year-old Japanese-Haitian, who became the first player representing Japan to win a Grand Slam, prevailed against all the odds. Victory, however, was bittersweet. The crowd booed her[105]. The announcers were in shock. 'Perhaps it's not the finish we were looking for today,' said one prominent commentator, adding 'This mama is a role model and respected by all.' Muted kudos at best for Naomi. 'It's not fair,' wailed Hillary Williams, after the umpire issued a warning when her coach was caught signalling her from the stand. Under questioning after the game, the coach admitted that he had done so but said the penalty was hypocritical: 'Everybody does it,' he said. After smashing her racket onto the court, another violation for which the umpire docked her a point, Serena Clinton accused the judges of stealing the match from her. 'Apologise,' she screamed at the umpire. 'You are the liar. You owe me an apology.''You will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live.' 'Men have said much worse without penalty,' said the establishment's choice after the umpire docked her a game for the verbal abuse. 'They get away with it because they are men.' The crowd stayed with her, as did the commentators. Writing for theIndependent, Jonathan Liew contended that[106] 'the fundamental divide here is between those for whom this is no more than a simple issue of rule enforcement, and those for whom this is part of something much larger: of who gets to make the rules and who has to live with them, of wider injustices that originated long before Hillary ever picked up a racquet, and will endure long after she has put it down for the last time.' The 'sanctity of the rules,' he said, 'has always struck me as faintly suspicious. . . . [A]nd they're never as objective as they look.' Now, at the peak of her career, Serena Clinton is 'a walking time capsule of all the big and little injustices that have pockmarked her life.' It's all so unfair. No one ever proved that she did anything wrong when her directed investment in cattle futures turned $1,000 into $100,000 in a little over 10 months. Maybe she was a little imprudent when she told a lineman in 2009 'I swear to God I'll take the fucking ball and shove it down your fucking throat.' But that lost her the match point. It was so unfair. Only someone insensitive to how the rules pretend to be objective but are really stacked against marginalised groups could think that otherwise More[107] 'Resistance' Arson Suspected in Wyoming GOP HQ Fire[108] Andrew West Constitution.com September 7, 2018  Over the course of the last two years, we have seen an alarming trend in this nation of ours as the left devolves into a violent and vitriolic mob of miscreants. Democrats, and the 'resistance' that they conspire with, have been wholly 'triggered' by each and every move of the Donald Trump presidency. They believe, for some reason, that he is somehow invalid as Commander in Chief, and they are hoping to convert a fighting force out of these malleable millennials in order to fulfill CNN's wishes for a New Civil War. Of course, that's all for ratings, as we've explained dozens of times already. In Wyoming, yet another instance of resistance violence has occurred, this time in a suspected arson[109] at a local GOP office. A Republican Party office in Laramie, Wyoming, caught fire early Thursday morning just days after it opened, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned. The fire appears to have been set intentionally, Laramie Police Department spokesman Steve Morgan told TheDCNF. The local police department is cooperating with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) in the ongoing investigation,Morgan said, adding that authorities have not yet identified a suspect or a motive for the fire. The burnt office is shared by the Albany County Republican Party and the Wyoming College Republicans, who began moving in on Tuesday, less than 48 hours before the fire, Albany GOP spokesman Ben McKay said. Beginning just over a year ago with the GOP charity baseball team shooting, the left has been attacking conservative politicians and supporter alike in brazen acts of political terrorism, all the while allowing the mainstream media to spin these incident, (or completely ignore them), in order to demonize the President and his party More[110] Build that wall[111]: Arizona rancher supports Trump's campaign by sharing a 25-minute video of armed immigrants sneaking across his property into the US The Daily Mail (UK) 7 September 2018  An Arizona rancher has set up surveillance cameras on his property to film the number of immigrants, drug mules and human smugglers who he claims regularly use his property as a gateway to the United States. John Chilton, 79, managed to capture hours of footage of illegal immigrants crossing over the US-Mexico[112] border onto his50,000-acre property in Arivaca. In a 25-minute videoobtained by theDaily Caller[113], Chilton's cameras show a steady stream of people, including some dressed incamouflage and brandishing guns, trespassing on his ranch. The rancher said most of the surveillance videos were filmed this year, but some date back to 2016. Chilton, who is a fifth-generation Arizona cattleman, is an outspoken Arizona backer of President Donald Trump's efforts to secure the US-Mexico border. He said he has long pushed the government to have more than a barbed-wire fence along the border. Chilton said he set up the surveillance cameras to prove his point about the dangers of trespassers crossing over onto his property.Some of the people captured trespassing on the property were carrying large backpacks and supplies, while others carried guns and guided horses.

Kaepernick[117] started the NFL national anthem protests and has made many other controversialstatements[118] during his time as a quarterback in the league. The private Christian school wanted nothing to do with the brand afterit chose Kaepernick asits brand representative. In response to Nike's new ad, the College of the Ozarks penned a press release stating why they would no longer compete in Nike uniforms, stating, 'College of the Ozarks plans to remove all athletic uniforms purchased from Nike or that contain the Nike emblem. Student athletes will no longer wear the brand in response to the company's new ad campaign.' College President Jerry C. Davis didn't hold back in his criticisms of the Kaepernick deal, stating: 'In their new ad campaign, we believe Nike executives are promoting an attitude of division and disrespect toward America. Nike is ashamed of America, we are ashamed of them. We also believe that those who know what sacrifice is all about are more likely to be wearing a military uniform than an athletic uniform.' More[119] Amsterdam Stabbing, You Have Your Own Opinion, But Not Your Own Facts[120] John Farnam Ammoland September 6, 2018  Last Friday, two American tourists were singled-out, attacked[121], and stabbed by a 19-year-old Afghan Jihadi within a busy train station in Amsterdam. Central Station is, in fact, the entry and exit point for most visitors to Amsterdam. The suspect, knife still in hand, was subsequently confronted by, and immediately shot by, Dutch police. The suspect and the two victims of his unprovoked attack are all expected to recover. Based on statements by the perpetrator after his arrest, Dutch authorities said on Saturday that the suspect had 'a terrorist motive.' On Sunday, they curiously revised their assessment (under pressure from the tourist industry), saying, 'The victims were not chosen deliberately, nor with a clear reason' Unclear motives? Oh, please! Don't insult my intelligence! Islamic terrorists, invited in by leftist politicians, are now out-of-control in Holland, and in most of Western Europe and the UK. They will continue to physically harm Western interests and citizens at every opportunity. They have their holy orders. Friday's focused attack on Americans is thus typical of what we're going to see for the foreseeable future More[122] France: Muslim screaming 'Allahu akbar' drives through airline terminal to ram airport passengers[123] Oh yes, the new arrivals are assimilating just fine Dave Robert Spencer Jihad Watch Sep 10, 2018  Celebrate diversity! ''Allahu Akbar' shouting man drives through French terminal to ram airport passengers,' by Abdelhamid Kaddour, Voice of Europe[124], September 10, 2018: This morning a Muslim terrorist was arrested[125] by French police after he tried to ram his car into pedestrians in the terminal at Lyon's airport. A man was reported driving at high speed going the wrong direction on a highway from the Ain department for dozens of kilometres. He was stopped by police but managed to flee with his car then went to Lyon-Bron's airport, while trying to mow down pedestrians, fortunately without success. The suspect went on to the Saint-Exupry Airport while under fire by four or five police officers, all of whom were unable to hit him. The man crashed through two glass doors entering the airport terminal where he was finally stopped by a security agent, who was able to stop him with his defence stick. According to police sources the man shouted 'Allah Akbar' and said that he was 'sent by God' when he was arrested More[126] UK: Hijab-wearing Muslima screaming 'Kill, kill, kill!' stabs one man, tries to stab others in busy town center[127] Robert Spencer Jihad Watch Sep 8, 2018  Time for Theresa May to issue another assurance to the public that she is busy countering the threat of 'far-right extremism.' ''Kill, kill, kill!': Woman wearing a headscarf rampages through town centre with a foot-log kitchen knife and slashes one man and chases others before she is arrested by police,' by Charlie Bayliss, Mailonline[128], September 8, 2018 (thanks to R): A knife-wielding woman wearing a headscarf chased shoppers through a busy town centre shouting 'kill, kill, kill' and 'I'm not a terrorist', shocked eyewitnesses have said. South Yorkshire Police put the town centre on lockdown amid a 'serious incident' at around 8.20am this morning. Police have confirmed a person was arrested after a man was stabbed today, although there has been an ongoing investigation as to whether more people were involved in the attack. While police have not confirmed whether the gender of the arrested suspect, a number of witnesses said the attacker was an Asian female wearing a headscarf. She reportedly stabbed one man in the shoulder after chasing him through the town centre. She tried to stab several others, including a window cleaner and market stall holder, before she was arrested in the train station She pursued a white man up and down a road along a hundred yard stretch More[129] Returning British jihadists could face ten years in prison[130]  Here's the problem with this new law: What happens when 10 years are up? A jihadist is not going to reform while in prisonA jihadist will go back to the jihad This law's problem is that it does not recognize that jihadists are not criminals They are soldiers, and as such should be detained for the entire endurance of the jihadwhich could be for the rest of their natural lives Dave Kate McCann, Senior Political Correspondent The Telegraph (UK) 6 September 2018  British jihadis returning from Syria and similar countries could face 10 years in prison under Home Office plans to tackle foreign fighters. The new rules will be introduced in the Counter-Terror Bill and mean that anyone who is found to have travelled to a designated country could be prosecuted on their return, even if they are not a member of a banned terror group. Only those working for aid charities or media organisations will be exempt from arrest. The new plan will make it easier to jail those who travel abroad to fight for extremist groups[131]. Currently it is difficult to criminalise British nationals who travel to Syria unless it can be proven that they aided an organisation such as the More[132] Egyptian man arrested after backpack caught fire[133]: Authorities say the suspect embraced an 'extremist ideology' and intended to carry out a hostile attack on the U.S. embassy in Cairo.  29 killed in Afghanistan as anti-Taliban leader mourned[134]: Insurgents killed at least 29 Afghan security forces in separate attacks as many marked the 17th anniversary of the killing of a prominent anti-Taliban leader, officials said Sunday.

And yes, civilian lives are at riskbut who can tell the civilians from the al Qaeda members??? Al Qaeda has a long history of blending in civiliansso we are now putting ourselves in the position of coming to the defense of al Qaeda It would be stupid to do this Also, note that Syria is planning a gas attackWHAT?</p><p>! Obama's gang assured us that they had reached an agreement with Assadwhere he removed such chemical weapons[2] Is Obama ever going to be held accountable? Dave Edmund DeMarche Fox News September 10, 2018 President Bashar al-Assad has approved a gas attack in the Idlib province, which is the country's last rebel stronghold, a report on Sunday said. Reports of Assad's approval comes about a week after President Trump warned the strongman[3] and his allies not to 'recklessly attack' the province. Trump called any gas attack a potential 'grave humanitarian mistake.' U.N. officials believe an offensive on Idlib would trigger a wave of displacement that could uproot an estimated 800,000 people and discourage refugees from returning home. The U.S. and France have warned an Idlib offensive would trigger a humanitarian crisis and warned that a chemical attack in Idlib would prompt a western retaliation. The Wall Street Journal reported[4] that the international pressure did little to sway Assad, who benefits from support from Russia and Iran. The report said Assad has approved the use of chlorine gas. For Russia and Iran, both allies of the Syrian government, retaking Idlib is crucial to complete what they see as a military victory in Syria's civil war after Syrian troops recaptured nearly all other major towns and cities, largely defeating the rebellion against Assad. President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province. The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Don't let that happen!   Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 3, 2018[5] Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Friday urged his counterparts to accept a cease-fire and avert a 'bloodbath' in Idlib.

Trump Cuts $25 Million in Aid for Palestinians in East Jerusalem Hospitals[8] He who pays the piper calls the tune, and the man paying the piper is President Trump Palestinians rage against the United States[9] and kill Americans[10], as well as attack Israel[11], a key ally They have turned peace negotiations into a bad joke[12] Why should they expect us to give them hundreds of millions of dollars each year? If they want American money, they need to start acting like an ally and not an enemy Dave Reuters Independent Journal Review Sep 9, 2018  U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered that $25 million earmarked for the care of Palestinians in East Jerusalem hospitals be directed elsewhere as part of a review of aid, a State Department official said on Saturday. Trump called for a review of U.S. assistance to the Palestinians earlier this year to ensure that the funds were being spent in accordance with national interests and were providing value to taxpayers. 'As a result of that review, at the direction of the President, we will be redirecting approximately $25 million originally planned for the East Jerusalem Hospital Network,' the State Department official said. 'Those funds will go to high-priority projects elsewhere.' The aid cut is the latest in a number of actions by the Trump administration that have alienated the Palestinians, including the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. That move reversed longtime U.S. policy and led Palestinian leadership to boycott Washington peace efforts led by Jared Kushner, Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law. Last month, the Trump administration said it would redirect $200 million in Palestinian economic support funds for programs in the West Bank and Gaza. And at the end of August, the Trump administration halted all funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), a decision that further heightened tensions with the Palestinian leadership. Palestinian refugees have reacted with dismay to the funding cuts, warning they would lead to more poverty, anger and instability in the Middle East. A statement from the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said the latest aid cut was part of a U.S. attempt 'to liquidate the Palestinian cause' and said it would threaten the lives of thousands of Palestinians and the livelihoods of thousands of hospital employees. 'This dangerous and unjustified American escalation has crossed all red lines and is considered a direct aggression against the Palestinian people,' it said One of the centers, Al Makassed Islamic Charitable Society Hospital, said in statement the U.S. aid cuts come as the 'hospital is going through a suffocating crisis as a result of the lack of flow of financial aid, and the piling up of debts and funds held back by the Palestinian government'. It said it had received 45 million shekels ($12.5 million) of the U.S. money to treat patients from the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. In the statement hospital CEO Dr. Bassam Abu Libdeh 'questioned the justification behind mixing political issues with medical and humanitarian issues.' The last round of U.S.-brokered Palestinian-Israeli peace talks collapsed in 2014 More[13] Trump administration to close Palestinian leadership's office in a bid to mount pressure over peace deal[14] Lukas Mikelionis Fox News September 10, 2018 The Trump administration cuts its $300 million yearly contribution to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, citing a disproportionate share of the burden and an endlessly expanding recipient pool; Trey Yingst reports from the West Bank. The Trump administration is reportedly set to announce the closing of the Palestine Liberation Organization's office in Washington, D.C., in a bid to pressure the Palestinian leadership to participate in Middle East peace efforts. According to the\u00a0Wall Street Journal[15], national security adviser John Bolton is expected to make the announcement on Monday. 'The United States will always stand with our friend and ally, Israel,' Bolton is expected to say, according to the prepared remarks. 'The Trump administration will not keep the office open when the Palestinians refuse to start direct and meaningful negotiations with Israel.' The video and more[16] Trump's Moves on NATO, NAFTA Were Needed[17] The anonymous op-ed author complains about Trump's policies, but it was time for a change. Harold Hutchison Patriot Post Sep. 7, 2018  The anonymous New York Times op-ed[18] from a 'senior administration official' has generated a lot of heat, but it does seem overblown. Among that author's complaints is how President Donald Trump is dealing with NATO and NAFTA. So what's the real scoop behind Trump's purportedly 'dangerous' threat to pull out of the alliance and the trade agreement? Let's start by acknowledging that we have these powerful trade chips only because this president is willing to question how the status quo benefits America. As for NATO, its purpose was to deter aggression from the Warsaw Pact (really the Soviet Union and a collection of puppet states). Since the fall of the USSR, the alliance's defenses have badly dwindled. This order of battle[19] (it's a Word document) shows just how numerically superior the NATO military was in 1989. Today, the forces NATO can send are fewer in numbers, and there are significant problems[20] with readiness. Then there's the factor of Russia having geopolitical kompromat[21] on some of our NATO allies. No wonder Trump has been delivering some tough messages[22] to Canada and Germany for their lack of readiness. How bad is it? Germany's 'green' jet fuel grounded its fleet of Tornado attack jets, and Canada needed to borrow a replenishment oiler from Chile. This type of nonsense is what President Trump is dealing with. The previous strategy of nicely asking allies to address the growing decline of NATO simply failed. Even our closest allies, like the United Kingdom, were dropping capabilities left and right. It was time to hit them with a figurative two-by-four. The same applied to NAFTA. Mexico and Canada had been ripping off American workers in some areas, notably in the production of automobiles. Trump used the threat of an American pullout to get Mexico to come to the table to renegotiate NAFTA. Now, he's using hardball to get Canada to rethink its barriers for dairy products, among other things. This isn't to say that playing hardball is coming without figurative casualties. On the contrary   standing up for oneself often involves short-term pain, whether the opponent is a schoolyard bully or a trading partner. Those who think Trump is reckless should take a look at how Ronald Reagan handled arms control. He was willing to go for the complete elimination of a class of nuclear weapons, but when the Soviets wouldn't negotiate in good faith, he improved our nation's nuclear arsenal. Eventually, the Soviets caved and negotiated the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (which they are now cheating on[23]) and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). Back then, there was a lot of weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth that Reagan would start a global thermonuclear war. Much of it was from Democrats and what was then the establishment Republicans More[24] Anti-Trump journalists find new, bizarre ways to join the resistance[25] Dan Gainor Fox News September 9, 2018 It's all about monetizing 'the resistance' and getting a piece of the 'hate Trump' action Dave Media bias seems to get worse by the week. Even a work week shortened by Labor Day delivered on that depressing trend. Journalists cheered protests at the Supreme Court nomination hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh and swallowed a silly Internet hoax. Then there was the anonymous New York Times op-ed defending a 'steady state' rebellion against President Trump. It was a new low for journalists devoted to overturning a democratic election. Call it the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The New York Times trumped opposition leaders at CNN and The Washington Post. The three battle daily for liberal attention and journalistic kudos like unhinged 'Bachelorette' finalists, each desperate to win favor.  The op-ed[26] let the Times celebrate victory for now. It easily passed the Post with its snoozy new Bob Woodward book[27] and CNN's celebration for taking down InfoWars chief Alex Jones[28]. The Times said publishing an anonymous op-ed is a 'rare step.' So rare, no one in journalism remembered anyone else doing it to attack the president of the United States. But then, we've only had President Donald J. Trump for about 20 months. The op-ed brought out more insanity. MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace[29] fantasized about removing Trump and said it was time for 'a serious debate about the 25th Amendment in this country.' Fellow host Ari Melber combined with his guests to call the administration a 'dumpster fire' 11 times[30] in one segment. Things were just as bad over at CNN. 'Wolf' host Wolf Blitzer[31] kept asking if America was heading to a 'constitutional crisis,' as if a Times op-ed equaled the rule of law 'CBS This Morning' fill-in co-host Bianna Golodryga was a rare voice of reason[32] about the op-ed. She worried it would exacerbate America's 'erosion of trust' in journalism. She's right. 2. 'No, I'm Spartacus': If the op-ed provided the drama for the week, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on the Supreme Court nomination of Kavanaugh provided almost everything else - from comedy to farce. Journalists loved how Democrats turned the hearing into a circus, complete with hundreds of arrests and women dressed in outfits[33] straight out of Hulu's pro-abortion dystopia 'The Handmaid's Tale.'[34] There were breathless reports [35]of 'chaos' or 'fireworks' but at least it was 'dramatic' enough to keep journalists happy. In reality, it was a 'was all carefully choreographed,'[36] reported ABC's Terry Moran, as Senate Democrats and their most-unhinged allies created a scene[37] they hope will aid them in the midterms, after Kavanaugh is already sitting on the Supreme Court That wasn't even the best part. The left flipped out over former Kavanaugh clerk Zina Bash, who they claimed flashed an 'OK' sign during the hearing. (Hint: She didn't.) 'The gesture was declared a white-power symbol and 'a national outrage' by a #resistance tweeter who has 200,000 followers,' wrote Politico [38]and coverage of the left's 'Self-Own' went downhill from there 3. Obama's Back: There is no one the media adore more than President Obama Now Obama has returned and journalists have visions of a rainbow-hued Camelot once more dancing in their heads. He spoke in Illinois Friday criticizing Trump and said[39] 'the politics of resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.' The media have been pretending that is true for years, so they loved it. CNN depicted the battle as 'Obama and Trump fight for America's soul.' [40]CNN host and former Obama green jobs czar[41] Van Jones loved it and explained how 'democracy is at risk.' Fellow host Brooke Baldwin called the speech 'incredible.' And Politico was giddy, claiming[42] in a headline: 'Obama vs. Trump: The clash everyone's waited for arrives.' By 'everyone,' what Politico meant was 'journalists.' Conservatives never wanted to see Obama again More[43] After Obama Accuses Trump of Using Divisive Language, Marco Rubio Shows Him and His Party a Mirror[44] Sam Dorman Independent Journal Review Sep 8, 2018  On Saturday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) took a devastating swipe at former President Barack Obama after his Friday speech[45] in which the high-profile Democrat criticized President Donald Trump and his party. Obama's speech called for a return to decency in government and an end to divisive language in politics  \u00a0a request\u00a0that Rubio indicated was hypocritical for the former president: Pres. Obama is right. It is wrong for a President to use divisive language, such as: 1. Call all opponents of same-sex marriage bigots, 2. Call the Pro-Life movement a 'War on Women', 3. Call all immigration enforcement advocates racists, 4.

In the same interview[56] with Fareed Zakaria on CNN's 'GPS,' however, Kerry suggested that the country is in the midst of a 'genuine constitutional crisis' because President Trump is not capable of performing his job. Kerry's remarks were an echo of far-left Democrats like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who have floated the idea of removing the president using the 25th Amendment[57] More[58] NYU declines to discipline Professor Sam Lavigne for posting personal information that put ICE employees' and their families' safety at risk[59] Florida Family Association Please send your email to NYU Officers and Board of Trustees. Click here to send your email to express disappointment regarding NYU's failure to discipline Sam Lavigne for doxxing ICE employees.[60] Post a message at       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/NYU\">https://www.facebook.com/NYU</url>/[61] 761K likes.; Florida Family Association sent out alerts during the week of July 9, 2018 that encouraged people to send emails to NYU officers and trustees regarding Professor Sam Lavigne's actions that put ICE employees' and their families' safety at risk. The action emails encouraged NYU officials to properly discipline the professor. However, NYU and many of its trustees started blocking the form emails sent through Florida Family Association's email server. Florida Family Association responded by sending out new alerts during the week of July 16, 2018 with the action email formatted to be sent through each subscribers' own email client.\u00a0 Unfortunately, after more than a month, it appears that NYU has declined to discipline Professor Sam Lavigne for posting personal information that put ICE employees' and their families' safety at risk. His doxxing could have resulted in physical harm to ICE employees and their families. Now that the information is out there it still could result in harm. NYU would very likely have immediately terminated any staff member if he or she were a conservative who published personal information on people who are on the opposite side of the political spectrum. Sam Lavigne's outrageous doxxing of law enforcement personnel cried out for strong disciplinary action. However, NYU's bias prevented it from applying equal discipline and in this case justice for the ICE employees. NYU Professor Sam Lavigne[62] created a data base on 1,595 ICE employees using personal information posted at LinkedIn. Lavigne shared the information with his 3,600 Twitter followers in an effort to doxx the ICE employees. Doxxing is defined as searching for and publishing private personal data with the intent of provoking malice toward the subjects of the doxxing More[63] Google and Mastercard Cut a Secret Ad Deal to Track Retail Sales[64] Google found the perfect way to link online ads to store purchases: credit card data The key point is that your data is being aggregated for saleWhat's to keep it from being sold to - or commandeered bya foreign nation or the government?

But most of the two billion Mastercard holders aren't aware of this behind-the-scenes tracking. That's because the companies never told the public about the arrangement.\u00a0 Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Mastercard Inc. brokered a business partnership during about four years of negotiations, according to four people with knowledge of the deal, three of whom worked on it directly.\u00a0The alliance gave Google an unprecedented asset for measuring retail spending, part of the search giant's strategy to fortify its primary business against onslaughts from Amazon.com Inc. and others. But the deal, which has not been previously reported, could raise broader privacy concerns about how much consumer data technology companies like Google quietly absorb. 'People don't expect what they buy physically in a store to be linked to what they are buying online,' said Christine Bannan, counsel with the advocacy group Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). 'There's just far too much burden that companies place on consumers and not enough responsibility being taken by companies to inform users what they're doing and what rights they have.' Google paid Mastercard millions of dollars for the data, according to two people who worked on the deal, and the companies discussed sharing a portion of the ad revenue, according to one of the people. The people asked not to be identified discussing private matters. A spokeswoman for Google said there is no revenue sharing agreement with\u00a0its partners. A Google spokeswoman\u00a0declined to comment on the partnership with Mastercard, but addressed the ads tool.\u00a0'Before we launched this beta product last year, we built a new, double-blind encryption technology that prevents both Google and our partners from viewing our respective users' personally identifiable information,' the company said in a statement.\u00a0'We do not have access to any personal information from our partners' credit and debit cards, nor do we share any personal information with our partners.'

'We have to say yes to socialism   to the word and everything,' Carrey said on HBO's 'Real Time with Bill Maher' show. 'We have to stop apologizing.' The actor, who's among the richest in Hollywood, made the remarks after Maher pointed out that Republicans criticize socialist and progressive Democrats by invoking the example of Venezuela, a failing socialist regime where thousands of Venezuelans flee every week amid dire living conditions. 'But that word the Democrats need to get a plan to fight this slander of, 'Socialism, you're going to be living in Venezuela,'' said Maher. 'And I don't see it yet.' Republicans have repeatedly slammed the Democratic Party upon the election of troves of socialist candidates in the primaries across the U.S., including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who became the face of the changing party following her shock win against one of the top Democratic lawmakers, Joe Crowley, in New York. More recently, progressive and socialist candidates made advances in Florida and Massachusetts, with Boston city councilor Ayanna Pressley unseating 10-term U.S. Rep. Michael Capuano in a Democratic primary last week. The host of the HBO show said the party's leftward shift is a reaction to President Trump's victory in the 2016 presidential election.

In a statement released Sunday evening, CBS said that Moonves would depart his position as chairman, president and CEO 'effective immediately.' COO Joseph Ianniello was announced as president and acting CEO 'while the Board conducts a search for a permanent successor.' The network also announced that it and Moonves would donate $20 million to organizations that support 'that support the #MeToo movement and equality for women in the workplace.' The $20 million would come out of any compensation Moonves is due to receive following the conclusion of an ongoing investigation into the allegations against him. Moonves' future at CBS came into question in July, when Farrow published an expose in the New Yorker[72] detailing allegations from six women. This week, multiple news outlets reported that Moonves was negotiating a possible exit with independent directors of CBS' board More[73] The BIG Lie: Feinstein on 'Deaths From Illegal Abortions'[74] She dishonestly insists Brett Kavanaugh is going to cost millions of women their lives. Jordan Candler Patriot Post Sep. 6, 2018  As corroborated by their incessant political theater, the dueling top interests of Democrat thespians are gun control and abortion, both of which they consider sacrosanct   to the point that these issues compete with each other as the litmus test[75] for judicial nominees. Therefore, no off-the-rocker rhetoric is off limits if it means Democrats succeed in ratcheting up tension and obstruction. The most outlandish bout of political theater on abortion this week occurred while Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) was lecturing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh   an originalist whose jurisprudence doesn't bode well for judicial despotism like Roe v. Wade. On Wednesday, Feinstein ridiculously asserted, 'In the 1950s and '60s, the two decades before Roe, deaths from illegal abortions in this country ran between 200,000 and 1.2 million. So, a lot of women died.' These numbers were supposedly obtained from the Guttmacher Institute, but as the Washington Examiner's Becket Adams reveals[76], Feinstein was spewing fake news: 'The Guttmacher Institute has reported no such thing. What Sen. Feinstein claimed during Wednesday's hearing is either her own ignorant misreading of the institute's reporting or it's an intentional, outright lie.' Instead, Guttmacher reports, 'Estimates of the number of illegal abortions in the 1950s and 1960s ranged from 200,000 to 1.2 million per year. One analysis, extrapolating from data from North Carolina, concluded that an estimated 829,000 illegal or self-induced abortions occurred in 1967.' Feinstein is conflating two very distinct things   the estimated number of unlawful abortions every year before they became legal, and maternal deaths. So her assertion this week that up to 1.2 million mothers died because abortion wasn't yet legal   and therefore hazardous to the mother   is a fabrication More[77] At Kavanaugh hearing, Cory Booker tells Republicans threatening his expulsion to 'bring it'[78] While Freedom Update has covered Cory Booker's antics beforewe hadn't seen a video of what he actually said Now you can see him carry on for yourself What Booker did was more than just foolish He deliberately tried to incite a revolt by inventing a conflict out of thin airdesigned to create a narrative that repressive conservativeswere keeping the truth about Kavanaugh's racism from the American people This is just the kind of narrative that would feed the Democratic Socialist worldview While we can be relieved that Booker was exposed as a phony[79]the mere fact that he attempted this fraud to gain power is unsettling We should expect more such antics from Democratic Socialistsas well as long-time Democrats trying to hold their seatsas their constituents lurch to the Left(or rather, as centrist Dems defect to the Republican Party) Democrats are desperate because President Trump's policies are serving the country wellThey would rather sow discord, division, and chaos than lose poweror admit that big government solutions don't work Dave Christopher Wilson Yahoo News September 6, 2018 The Supreme Court[80] confirmation hearing for Judge Brett Kavanaugh turned into a fight over Senate rules Thursday morning, with arguments about the release of confidential documents and threats of the possible expulsion of some members. 'Bring it,' said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., in response to a threat made Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, that he could be expelled from the Senate if he released documents marked 'confidential' to the Senate Judiciary Committee. 'Then apply the rule and bring the charges.' Booker said that he was 'knowingly violating the rules' of the Senate and releasing documents that were only made available to senators this week, just before the hearings started. Booker said he would be releasing a document related to Kavanaugh and racial profiling that contained no personal information and was not a national security threat. Booker's office later released the document (read it here[81]) in which Kavanaugh was critical of some Department of Transportation affirmative action policies. 'The fundamental problem in this case is that these DOT regulations use a lot of legalisms and disguises to mask what is a naked racial set-aside,' wrote Kavanaugh in the 2003 email. Cornyn said Booker's possible 2020 presidential aspirations were his motivation for releasing the document, adding that no senator deserved to sit on the committee if they wanted to be a law unto themselves. The debate centered on documents that were marked confidential by Bill Burck, a former George W. Bush White House staffer and Kavanaugh deputy. Democrats have stated that they didn't have time to go over the documents and that there is a conflict in interest by Burke. Some of the documents were leaked to the New York Times on Wednesday evening, including one 2003 email in which Kavanaugh questioned whether Roe v. Wade was settled law of the land. Women's health advocates have said that Kavanaugh[82] would overturn the ruling and criminalize abortions. A number of Democrats on the committee then stepped forward to say they would also share any consequences suffered by Booker for releasing Kavanaugh's emails. 'If there's going to be some retribution against the senator from New Jersey, count me in,' said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. 'Count me in, too,' said Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, who said she was releasing a document to the press and would 'defy anyone reading this document that to be able to conclude that this should be deemed confidential in any way, shape or form.' Hirono later released the documents[83], about programs for Native Hawaiians, on Twitter. 'All of us are ready to face that rule on the bogus designation of committee confidential,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn. 'Just because there's a Senate rule doesn't mean it can be misapplied, misconstrued or misused. And I think even the threat raised by one of my colleagues here is misfortunate   and that is a kind way of putting it, will all due respect.' Cornyn then cited Senate Rule 29.5, which says that any senator who discloses confidential or secret Senate business could suffer expulsion from the body. At that point, Booker repeatedly told Cornyn to 'bring it' and that he would accept the consequences of his actions. Burck told the Washington Post[84] Thursday afternoon that he had cleared Booker's documents on Wednesday night, adding\u00a0'We were surprised to learn about Senator Booker's histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly.' The video and more[85] 'I Am Schmuck-acus.'[86]  What was Corey Booker really up to? Now we know Dave Jim Geraghty National Review September 7, 2018  'This is about the closest I'll have in my life to an 'I am Spartacus' moment,' New Jersey senator Cory Booker declared during yesterday's Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in one of the lamer and less convincing efforts by an aspiring presidential candidate to give himself a cool nickname. Alas, Booker's lame stunt   announcing that he would defy Senate rules and release confidential documents, and daring the Republicans to expel him, only to later find that the documents had been cleared for release   is getting an exceptionally sympathetic assessment from the mainstream media. Here's the Washington Post's description: Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.), soon joined by other Democrats, released documents he said were marked confidential. There's some dispute as to whether, at the time Booker released an email chain of Kavanaugh talking about his views on racial profiling, they were actually still confidential. Aides on both sides of the aisle said they were set for release Thursday morning. Then what, exactly, is the dispute? If aides on both sides agree that the documents were set for release Thursday morning, then they weren't confidential, now were they? Cory Booker is walking up to the free-sample tray and announcing to everyone that it's shoplifting. Booker boasted that he was willing to risk expulsion from the Senate, with way too much 'don't throw me into that briar patch' tone. For starters, Article I, Section 5, of the United StatesConstitution says, 'Each House [of Congress] may determine the Rules of its proceedings, punish its members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds, expel a member.' You're not going to get two-thirds of the U.S. Senate to expel Booker   although Democrats might vote to keep Booker around for a different reason than you might think. Cory Booker seriously wants to be the next president, and right now, a day job in the Senate is a hindrance. For a while, the day job gave him a platform for publicity stunts, like fiercely denouncing the man he praised and cosponsored legislation with just two years earlier[87], or calling the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh 'evil[88].' (Notice how quickly everyone forgot about that? These publicity stunts and over-the-top rhetoric are political junk food, with little-lasting effect or consequence.) But serving in the Senate has now become a time commitment that keeps Booker away from where he wants to be: campaigning in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, etcetera before the small army of rival candidates descends upon those states. It's also difficult to stand out in the Senate; right now at least six of Booker's colleagues are also thinking about running in 2020: Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota[89], Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Jeff Merkley of Oregon[90], Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. (Don't feel bad, I had forgotten about Klobuchar and Merkley too.) If you're Booker, why not end your Senate career with a bang, pose as a martyr to those secretive, nasty Republicans, and get a couple months head start on the rest of the Democratic field? The problem for Booker is that so far, no one's taking the bait. The only person talking about expelling Cory Booker is Cory Booker More[91] Taxpayers paid LAPD detail to guard California Sen. Kamala Harris, a Democrat, at out-of-town events[92] Why is the City of Los Angeles paying for the security of a federal senator??? It is becoming evident that social justice warriorsof the Democratic Socialist party believe their mission is so importantthat they transcend those despised symbols of the White-Male hegemonyotherwise known as laws Dave Teri Webster The Blaze September 8, 2018 Taxpayers paid for armed, plain-clothes Los Angeles police officers to accompany U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) to public events and media appearances, KNBC-TV reported[93]. How much was spent? The TV station obtained records showing expenses that include airline tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, and meals. The total cost reached beyond $28,000, without including the officers' overtime. Although the Los Angeles Police Department regularly provides security for security for dignitaries and other officials in the city, extending that role to a senator traveling to other cities is 'unprecedented,' the report stated. Mayor Eric Garcetti's office reportedly said the Mayor was unaware of the arrangement, which was shut down in July by new LAPD Chief Michel Moore. 'It was not until Chief Moore was sworn in, conducted a new assessment of the threat, determined that this arrangement was no longer needed, and informed Mayor Garcetti, that the mayor became aware of the state-wide detail,' Garcetti spokesman Alex Comisar wrote in a statement to the TV station. Garcetti indicated former LAPD Chief Charlie Beck was solely responsible for the program. 'Chief of Police Charlie Beck assigned a security detail for US Senator Kamala Harris shortly before she was sworn into office in 2017, based on a threat assessment he believed to be credible,' LAPD spokesman Josh Rubenstein told the news outlet. 'Funding for the detail was provided by the Department budget.' More[94] Kamala Harris's $50,000 LAPD guards not her first corruption rodeo[95] So corrupt So unhinged Dave Monica Showalter American Thinker September 10, 2018 California's Sen. Kamala Harris, the leftist Democratic presidential wannabe who got herself in the news after piously posturing against Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh, has now been caught with her hand in the till, traipsing around California with a Los Angeles Police Department bodyguard detail in tow, at a taxpayer-paid cost of nearly $50,000. NBC4 of Los Angeles\u00a0has the details[96]: 'Armed, plain-clothes LAPD officers were dispatched to California cities outside of Los Angeles at least a dozen times to provide security for U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris at public events, media appearances, and a party. LA taxpayers paid for airline tickets, hotel stays, car rentals, and meals, according to detailed expense reports obtained by NBC News. The total cost of the trips, not including the officers' overtime, topped $28,000.' The $28K was just a starting point in the cost extravaganza - overtime and other expenses made the total close to $50K. A new police chief found out about the unprecedented freebie from the people of Los Angeles and put a stop to it. The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, says he never heard of it and laid the blame squarely on recently retired LAPD chief Charlie Beck. One thing is certain: it's never been done before. But this being Harris, it's not surprising it happened. Harris, per this Mother Jones\u00a0biography[97], is a former California attorney general with a radical upbringing, who viewed her prosecutorial career not as a means of putting crooks in jail to protect communities, but as a means of long marching through the institutions[98] - corrupting them from within by taking them over in the name of left-wingery. Everything was political for her, including her political rise as the mistress of California swamp thing extraordinaire, former State Assembly speaker, and San Francisco mayor Willie Brown. As a prosecutor, she's engaged in some pretty impressive politically motivated corner-cutting. She falsified a confession transcript[99]\u00a0of a defendant and then, when she was caught, defended it. She's been caught making\u00a0phony charges of racism[100]\u00a0about her Berkeley upbringing, as if Berkeley in the 1970s were a den of Klansmen. She has an\u00a0army of fake Twitter followers[101] in an obvious bid to make herself look more influential than she really is. Lately, she put out a deceptively edited video to smear\u00a0Kavanaugh[102]. So no surprise to see her accepting an emolument from the politically correct and easy to shake down LAPD for free stuff. Stuff other candidates have to pay for. Stuff that costs taxpayers big bucks and creates lots of importance and prestige for herself Garcetti lays the whole scandal at the feet of LAPD former chief Charlie Beck, and sure enough, the pair of them go way back. Harris got elected attorney general in 2009, and Beck was the cop chief trying to avoid her politically correct prosecutorial gaze as he toed her political correctness line More[103] Whining Serena Williams is tennis's Hillary Clinton[104] Things didn't turn out how she wanted\u00a0  so she had a tantrum at the umpire. How classy! The social justice warrior mindset is spreading from politics throughout the culture Read how it provided space for Serena Williams to act like a complete jerkand expect to get away with itwith a large crowd of SJWs cheering her on, rules be damned Why? Because the rules are sexist, or racist, or somethingWho cares if her opponent was a Japanese-Haitian woman?! Down with the system!!! Dave Roger Kimball Spectator USA September 9, 2018 Your actual identity doesn't matteras long as you identify with the correct identityand accuse your opponents of being in league with the wrong identityIt's all so simple, isn't it? Dave No one expected Naomi Osaka to win the US Open yesterday. Everyone favoured her opponent. The crowd was solidly with Serena Williams, as were the bookies. But the 20-year-old Japanese-Haitian, who became the first player representing Japan to win a Grand Slam, prevailed against all the odds. Victory, however, was bittersweet. The crowd booed her[105]. The announcers were in shock. 'Perhaps it's not the finish we were looking for today,' said one prominent commentator, adding 'This mama is a role model and respected by all.' Muted kudos at best for Naomi. 'It's not fair,' wailed Hillary Williams, after the umpire issued a warning when her coach was caught signalling her from the stand. Under questioning after the game, the coach admitted that he had done so but said the penalty was hypocritical: 'Everybody does it,' he said. After smashing her racket onto the court, another violation for which the umpire docked her a point, Serena Clinton accused the judges of stealing the match from her. 'Apologise,' she screamed at the umpire. 'You are the liar. You owe me an apology.'\u00a0'You will never, ever, ever be on another court of mine as long as you live.' 'Men have said much worse without penalty,' said the establishment's choice after the umpire docked her a game for the verbal abuse. 'They get away with it because they are men.' The crowd stayed with her, as did the commentators. Writing for the\u00a0Independent, Jonathan Liew contended that[106] 'the fundamental divide here is between those for whom this is no more than a simple issue of rule enforcement, and those for whom this is part of something much larger: of who gets to make the rules and who has to live with them, of wider injustices that originated long before Hillary ever picked up a racquet, and will endure long after she has put it down for the last time.' The 'sanctity of the rules,' he said, 'has always struck me as faintly suspicious. . . . [A]nd they're never as objective as they look.' Now, at the peak of her career, Serena Clinton is 'a walking time capsule of all the big and little injustices that have pockmarked her life.' It's all so unfair. No one ever proved that she did anything wrong when her directed investment in cattle futures turned $1,000 into $100,000 in a little over 10 months. Maybe she was a little imprudent when she told a lineman in 2009 'I swear to God I'll take the fucking ball and shove it down your fucking throat.' But that lost her the match point. It was so unfair. Only someone insensitive to how the rules pretend to be objective but are really stacked against marginalised groups could think that otherwise More[107] 'Resistance' Arson Suspected in Wyoming GOP HQ Fire[108] Andrew West Constitution.com September 7, 2018  Over the course of the last two years, we have seen an alarming trend in this nation of ours as the left devolves into a violent and vitriolic mob of miscreants. Democrats, and the 'resistance' that they conspire with, have been wholly 'triggered' by each and every move of the Donald Trump presidency. They believe, for some reason, that he is somehow invalid as Commander in Chief, and they are hoping to convert a fighting force out of these malleable millennials in order to fulfill CNN's wishes for a New Civil War. Of course, that's all for ratings, as we've explained dozens of times already. In Wyoming, yet another instance of resistance violence has occurred, this time in a suspected arson[109] at a local GOP office. A Republican Party office in Laramie, Wyoming, caught fire early Thursday morning just days after it opened, The Daily Caller News Foundation learned. The fire appears to have been set intentionally, Laramie Police Department spokesman Steve Morgan told TheDCNF. The local police department is cooperating with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms (BATF) in the ongoing investigation,\u00a0Morgan said, adding that authorities have not yet identified a suspect or a motive for the fire. The burnt office is shared by the Albany County Republican Party and the Wyoming College Republicans, who began moving in on Tuesday, less than 48 hours before the fire, Albany GOP spokesman Ben McKay said. Beginning just over a year ago with the GOP charity baseball team shooting, the left has been attacking conservative politicians and supporter alike in brazen acts of political terrorism, all the while allowing the mainstream media to spin these incident, (or completely ignore them), in order to demonize the President and his party More[110] Build that wall[111]: Arizona rancher supports Trump's campaign by sharing a 25-minute video of armed immigrants sneaking across his property into the US The Daily Mail (UK) 7 September 2018  An Arizona rancher has set up surveillance cameras on his property to film the number of immigrants, drug mules and human smugglers who he claims regularly use his property as a gateway to the United States. John Chilton, 79, managed to capture hours of footage of illegal immigrants crossing over the US-Mexico[112] border onto his\u00a050,000-acre property in Arivaca. In a 25-minute video\u00a0obtained by the\u00a0Daily Caller[113], Chilton's cameras show a steady stream of people, including some dressed in\u00a0camouflage and brandishing guns, trespassing on his ranch. The rancher said most of the surveillance videos were filmed this year, but some date back to 2016. Chilton, who is a fifth-generation Arizona cattleman, is an outspoken Arizona backer of President Donald Trump's efforts to secure the US-Mexico border. He said he has long pushed the government to have more than a barbed-wire fence along the border.\u00a0 Chilton said he set up the surveillance cameras to prove his point about the dangers of trespassers crossing over onto his property.\u00a0Some of the people captured trespassing on the property were carrying large backpacks and supplies, while others carried guns and guided horses.

Kaepernick[117] started the NFL national anthem protests and has made many other controversial\u00a0statements[118] during his time as a quarterback in the league. The private Christian school wanted nothing to do with the brand after\u00a0it chose Kaepernick as\u00a0its brand representative. In response to Nike's new ad, the College of the Ozarks penned a press release stating why they would no longer compete in Nike uniforms, stating, 'College of the Ozarks plans to remove all athletic uniforms purchased from Nike or that contain the Nike emblem. Student athletes will no longer wear the brand in response to the company's new ad campaign.' College President Jerry C. Davis didn't hold back in his criticisms of the Kaepernick deal, stating: 'In their new ad campaign, we believe Nike executives are promoting an attitude of division and disrespect toward America. Nike is ashamed of America, we are ashamed of them. We also believe that those who know what sacrifice is all about are more likely to be wearing a military uniform than an athletic uniform.'

Central Station is, in fact, the entry and exit point for most visitors to Amsterdam. The suspect, knife still in hand, was subsequently confronted by, and immediately shot by, Dutch police. The suspect and the two victims of his unprovoked attack are all expected to recover. Based on statements by the perpetrator after his arrest, Dutch authorities said on Saturday that the suspect had 'a terrorist motive.' On Sunday, they curiously revised their assessment (under pressure from the tourist industry), saying, 'The victims were not chosen deliberately, nor with a clear reason' Unclear motives? Oh, please! Don't insult my intelligence! Islamic terrorists, invited in by leftist politicians, are now out-of-control in Holland, and in most of Western Europe and the UK. They will continue to physically harm Western interests and citizens at every opportunity. They have their holy orders.

A man was reported driving at high speed going the wrong direction on a highway from the Ain department for dozens of kilometres. He was stopped by police but managed to flee with his car then went to Lyon-Bron's airport, while trying to mow down pedestrians, fortunately without success. The suspect went on to the Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport while under fire by four or five police officers, all of whom were unable to hit him. The man crashed through two glass doors entering the airport terminal where he was finally stopped by a security agent, who was able to stop him with his defence stick.

The answer from Twitter? Weasel words:'his message was not adverse to any policies currently in effect' We know this isn't trueAre they trying to tell us that Alex Jones[3] is worse than Farrakhan??? Dave Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News October 17, 2018 Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who in a recent tweet said he was not prejudiced against Jewish people but was simply 'anti-Termite,' will be allowed to continue to use the social media platform. </p><p>Farrakhan took to the site[4] on Tuesday by posting a video of himself speaking at an event in Detroit, during which he addressed 'the members of the Jewish community that don't like me.' In a caption to the video, he wrote: 'I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-Termite.' A Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed News[5] that Farrakhan's account on the platform would not be suspended because his message was not adverse to any policies currently in effect. Twitter told Fox News that Buzzfeed's report was accurate.  However, the outlet noted in their Wednesday report that Farrakhan's tweet infringed on the company's proposed 'dehumanization policy.[6]' Twitter announced via blog post on Sept. 25 that they were seeking 'feedback on a policy before it's part of the Twitter Rules.' For several months, the company was working on a new guideline to combat 'dehumanizing language' on the site, some of which they said was already included in their 'hateful conduct policy.' 'But there are still Tweets many people consider to be abusive, even when they do not break our rules,' the blog post said. 'With this change, we want to expand our hateful conduct policy to include content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group, even when the material does not include a direct target.'  The public survey was set to conclude on Oct. 9 and an update on the proposed policy's status would come 'later this year,' the blog post said. The company, which proposed prohibiting dehumanization of 'anyone based on membership in an identifiable group,' defined it as 'language that treats others as less than human.'

Despite getting flak from sheltered employees who think national security is for losers, CEO Jeff Bezos sticks to his guns. He recently said this,'We are going to continue to support the DOD, and I think we should, it doesn't make any sense to me - sometimes, one of the jobs of senior leadership is to make the right decision, even when it's unpopular. And if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.' Now compare that common sense to Google's virtue-signaling cowardice. First, Google suspended its contracts with our military when some workers whined about it. Then they help China create a search engine that censors criticisms of its leaders \u2014 which suits Google, since they'll remove anything that upsets them. Apparently, this tech titan thinks it more evolved than the country it exploits. Defense is so yesterday. Security is for fascists. Plus they're terrified of the activists in the company cafeteria More[9] Turkey Details Alleged Killing of Saudi Journalist[10]: President Trump warns against finding Riyadh 'guilty until proven innocent' in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi Again, all that the Saudi's need to do to prove their innocenceis produce the security camera video showing Khashoggi leaving the building Where is it? It doesn't exist!The Saudi government is guilty of directing a gruesome murder and dismemberment Dave David Gauthier-Villars, Jessica Donati and Summer Said The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  ISTANBUL\u2014Saudi operatives beat, drugged, killed and dismembered a dissident Saudi journalist[11] in the presence of the kingdom's top diplomat in Istanbul, Turkish officials said Tuesday, as Washington urged Riyadh to provide answers. President Trump cautioned that Saudi Arabia should be considered innocent until proven guilty. His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on a visit to the kingdom, said Saudi leaders had 'strongly denied' involvement and were conducting 'a serious and credible investigation.' The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a former royal insider[12], has strained U.S.-Saudi ties[13] and sparked international outrage. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Saudi Arabia has denied any role in his disappearance. Mr. Trump has put Saudi Arabia and its crown prince at the center of a Middle East policy aimed at challenging Iran, Riyadh's main rival in the region, brokering an end to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis and countering extremism. Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the site of his first overseas presidential trip. The U.S. leader has emphasized the importance for U.S. jobs of the Saudi's purchasing of billions of dollars of U.S. military hardware.  In an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday, Mr. Trump compared the allegations that Saudi agents had killed Mr. Khashoggi to the accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh[14], who was sworn in last week after a bruising confirmation process. 'Here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent,' Mr. Trump said. 'We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned.' Turkish officials said they shared evidence in recent days, including the details of an audio recording[15], with both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to support their conclusion that Mr. Khashoggi was killed at the hand of Saudi operatives[16]. It wasn't clear how Turkish officials had an audio recording. The recording indicates how Mr. Khashoggi was killed in the office of the Saudi consul general, Mohammad al-Otaibi, minutes after he walked into the consulate building on Oct. 2, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Khashoggi wasn't interrogated, the people said. Instead, he was beaten up, drugged and killed by Saudi operatives who had flown in from Riyadh earlier in the day, the people said. Then, on the recording, a voice can be heard inviting the consul to leave the room, the people familiar with the matter said. The voice of a man Turkish authorities identified as Saudi forensic specialist Salah Al Tabiqi can be heard recommending other people present to listen to some music while he dismembered Mr. Khashoggi's body, the people said. Turkish investigators spent nine hours searching for clues inside the Saudi diplomatic premises on Monday and early Tuesday. Complicating the search, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was the fact that some rooms had been freshly repainted. Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia surfaced on Tuesday when Turkish investigators then sought to search the nearby consul's residence. In an unexpected development, Mr. Otaibi, the consul general, left Turkey for the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday afternoon and Saudi authorities informed Ankara that the residence was off limits, according to the people familiar with the matter. The latest Turkish allegations could complicate the Saudi government's efforts to provide an explanation of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi while distancing itself from any direct responsibility More[17] European Bank Officials Pull Out of Saudi Conference[18]: HSBC, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas chiefs are latest to withdraw after journalist's disappearance Margot Patrick and Jenny Strasburg The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  More banking executives pulled out of Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative conference Tuesday, with the heads of HSBC[19] HSBC -1.93% [20]Holdings PLC, Credit Suisse[21] CS -1.10% [22]Group AG and Standard Chartered PLC canceling plans to attend next week's event. This follows decisions this week by some of Wall Street's most prominent executives not to attend, amid a backlash against the kingdom[23] over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish officials say Mr. Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul this month. Saudi Arabia has denied the accusation[24]. The three bank chiefs pulled out Tuesday morning after discussing it among themselves, people familiar with the matter said. A fourth bank official, BNP Paribas [25]SA Chairman Jean Lemierre, later on Tuesday opted not to attend, as did London Stock Exchange Group[26] PLC CEO David Schwimmer. Global banks have been courting the Saudi government and its 33-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the public face of the kingdom's effort to establish itself as a financial and investing hub. Last year's inaugural conference, billed as a 'Davos in the Desert,' was well attended by Western executives.  Skipping this year's conference could mean banks miss out on potentially lucrative transactions involving the Saudi government over the coming years. However, many of the banks with chief executives canceling their appearances are still sending delegations. HSBC Chief Executive John Flint had been scheduled to speak, and the bank was a strategic partner for this year's conference. The British bank part-owns a lender and has an investment-banking joint venture in the country.  Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was on the conference's advisory board, while Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters was slated as a speaker.  Conference organizers have declined to comment on the cancellations and indicated the event would go forward as planned More[27] Saudi Money Flows Into Silicon Valley\u2014and With It Qualms[28]: The kingdom is now the largest single investor for U.S. startups, an unsettling fact for Silicon Valley If you are wondering why companies like Google, Facebook, and Twittershut down anyone who speaks against Islam[29]while permitting anti-Semites like Farrakhan to stay 'on the air'here is your answer Dave Eliot Brown and Greg Bensinger The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  As international backlash grows over Saudi Arabia's alleged involvement in the possible murder of a journalist[30], Silicon Valley faces a potentially unsettling fact: The kingdom is now the largest single funding source for U.S. startups. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has directed at least $11 billion of Saudi money into U.S. startups since mid-2016, either directly or through SoftBank Group[31] Corp.'s $92 billion tech-focused Vision Fund, to which the Saudis committed $45 billion[32], according to a Wall Street Journal estimate of data from research firm PitchBook. The total invested by the kingdom so far in U.S. startups is far bigger than the total raised by any single venture-capital fund.  Some of tech's most prominent young companies have welcomed Saudi money, including Uber Technologies Inc., office-sharing company WeWork Cos. and augmented-reality device maker Magic Leap Inc. For Uber, the situation could be particularly dicey: A prominent Saudi official sits on its board. For now, the companies are preferring to keep quiet about the escalating controversy. Of the 22 startups in which the Vision Fund or the Saudis have invested, all but one declined to comment or didn't respond to requests. Uber pointed to a recent statement from CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who said he planned to pull out of a Saudi-sponsored business conference and that he was troubled by the reports about the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. For the startup community, 'there are incidents where you have to look and decide which side of history you want to be on, and if this is true, this is one of those,' said Venky Ganesan, former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and an investor at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in Uber. 'It's more than about startups and money\u2014it's fundamentally about what you think about human rights.' Tech companies are in a particularly conflicted spot given the idealistic missions espoused by many leaders in Silicon Valley, where employees routinely rebel over contracts they find unprincipled. WeWork, for instance, has banned meat over concerns about its environmental impact. 'Silicon Valley has been incredibly hypocritical in accepting investments from an anti-Semitic country, [which] criminally punishes gays and de jure discriminates against women,' said Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist at prominent firm Khosla Ventures, in an email. Mr. Rabois's position also illustrates how pervasive Saudi money is: Multiple startups backed by Khosla have raised money from SoftBank's Saudi-backed Vision Fund, including online home-selling company Opendoor Labs Inc., of which he is a co-founder. SoftBank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund declined to comment.  The sheer scale of money is unprecedented\u2014and to some founders, irresistible. The Saudi-backed Vision Fund\u2014where the majority of investment decisions are made solely by SoftBank\u2014has led at least 20 deals totaling more than $17 billion of investment in U.S. startups, according to PitchBook. Saudi's Public Investment Fund has committed another $4.9 billion to Uber, Magic Leap and electric-car maker Lucid Motors Inc. After Uber co-founder and then-CEO Travis Kalanick flew to the kingdom to meet with the crown prince two years ago, he secured a $3.5 billion investment from PIF[33] within weeks, people familiar with the matter have said.

Suarez Sang Fox News October 17, 2018 Saudi-led coalition airstrike hits bus carrying several children; Greg Palkot reports on the latest in the deadly civil war. A group of Americans who had been elite soldiers or intelligence operatives were paid tens of thousands of dollarsby the United Arab Emirates to assassinate political leaders and Islamic clerics in Yemen in 2015, a new report says. According to a BuzzFeed[36] reported published Tuesday, the Delaware-incorporated Spear Operations Group recruited top veterans from the U.S. military after Spear was hired by the UAE to conduct a series of targeted killings for $1.5 million per month. The soldiers who allegedly signed on to do the dirty work were offered more than $25,000 a month. 'There was a targeted assassination program in Yemen,' Spear founder Abraham Golan, told BuzzFeed. 'I was running it. We did it. It was sanctioned by the UAE within the coalition.' Golan, a Hungarian-Israeli security contractor who lives outside of Pittsburgh, was referencing the Saudi-led band of nine countries fighting a proxy war against Iran in Yemen. The U.S. has helped the coalition by providing weapons, intelligenceand other items, the report said.  More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict since the coalition intervened in 2015 The video and more[37] Private-Equity Firm Abraaj Raised Billions Pledging to Do Good\u2014Then It Fell Apart[38]: Western investors poured money into the Dubai-based group, now the world's largest insolvent private-equity firm Do-gooder liberal globalist elites believed their own Islam-friendly propagandaand got burned Bill Gates doesn't look so smart nowadays, does he? Dave Simon Clark, Nicolas Parasie and William Louch The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  In January, the Abraaj Group had $14 billion of assets under management and was trying to raise $6 billion for what would be the world's largest emerging-markets private-equity fund. It's now the world's largest insolvent private-equity firm. In June, it filed for provisional liquidation[39]. During its rise, the Dubai-based firm attracted many Western investors. Its founder, Arif Naqvi, promised to make money by doing good in poorer countries, including with a fund that would invest in hospitals serving African and Asian cities. Abraaj's fall stands as a warning to those misled in their enthusiasm for the idea behind the firm. One former employee described Abraaj's work as 'inspirational capitalism at its most enlightened.' Signs of trouble went overlooked, with one investor receiving an anonymous email alleging problems at Abraaj.  The collapse has led some investors to question whether Dubai's regulatory environment is sufficiently safe[40]\u2014and privately, some worry it has damaged trust in the movement to use private capital to solve social problems in emerging markets. Mr. Naqvi raised billions from the likes of the Bill ...linda Gates Foundation, Bank of America[41] Corp. and the U.S. government. He made annual appearances at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and sponsored the Clinton Foundation's 2012 summit in New York. Abraaj marketing documents touted 17% net annual returns. Mr. Naqvi himself started a $100 million charity in his home country of Pakistan, and funded students attacked by the Taliban. He accumulated estates in England and France, a $20 million yacht, a private jet and Asian and Middle Eastern art. Some details of the collapse are known: Abraaj used investor funds for its own expenses, according to former executives and investors. The firm further muddied its finances with the 'unusual practice' of borrowing money[42] secured against its own stakes in its funds, creating 'a highly unstable business model,' liquidators wrote in a report. Abraaj has defaulted on more than $1 billion of debt More[43] State Department provided 'clearly false' statements to derail requests for Clinton docs, 'shocked' federal judge says[44] Gregg Re Fox News October 17, 2018 In a combative exchange at a hearingFriday in Washington, D.C., afederal judge unabashedly accused career State Department officials of lying and signing 'clearly false' affidavits to derail a series of lawsuits seeking information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said he was 'shocked' and'dumbfounded' when he learned that FBIhad granted immunity to former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills[45] during its investigation into the use of Clinton's server, according to a court transcript of his remarks. 'I had myself found that Cheryl Mills had committed perjury and lied under oath in a published opinion I had issued in a Judicial Watch case where I found her unworthy of belief, and I was quite shocked to find out she had been given immunity in \u2014 by the Justice Department in the Hillary Clinton email case,' Lamberth said during Friday's hearing. The Department of Justice's Inspector General(IG), Michael Horowitz, noted in a bombshell report[46] in June that it was 'inconsistent with typical investigative strategy' for the FBI to allow Mills to sit in during the agency's interview of Clinton during the email probe, given that classified information traveled throughMills' personal email account. '[T]here are serious potential ramifications when one witness attends another witness' interview,' the IG wrote.  On Friday, Lamberth,who was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, said hedid not know Mills had been granted immunity until he 'read the IG report and learned that and that she had accompanied [Clinton] to her interview.' The transparency group Judicial Watch initially sued the State Department in 2014, seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack after the government didn't respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Other parallel lawsuits by Judicial Watch are probing issues like Clinton's server, whose existencewas revealedduring the course of the litigation. The State Department had immediately moved to dismiss Judicial Watch's first lawsuit on a motion for summary judgment, saying in an affidavit that it had conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails in its possession and provided them.The affidavit noted that some more documents and emails could be forthcoming. But Lamberth denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit at the time \u2014 and on Friday, he said he was happy he did, charging that State Department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents, including those on Clinton's email server, had not in fact been produced. 'Itwas clear to me that at the time that I ruled initially, that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials, and it became more clear through discovery that the information that I was provided was clearly false regarding the adequacy of the search and this - what we now know turned out to be the Secretary's email system,' Lamberth said Friday More[47] Fusion GPS Founder Glenn Simpson Pleads the Fifth Before House Investigators[48] Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS,the opposition research firm behind the infamous Steele dosser, invoked his Fifth Amendmentrights before House investigators on Tuesday. Simpson's attorney, Josh Levy, decried a joint committee investigation into potential political bias in the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during the 2016 presidential election asMcCarthyism. 'This committee would make Sen. Joseph McCarthy proud,' Levy told[49] reporters on Capitol Hill. 'Like Sen. McCarthy, this committee has largely conducted its business through secret, confidential interviews and depositions, binding witnesses and their counsels into silence while the members walk outside to all of you the media with public and selectively leaked interviews to tell you what they want you to hear.' Reacting to Levy's comments, Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows (R-NC) said, 'You can't just invoke the fifth in order to avoid questions before Congress.' 'Mr. Levy is looking for a moment on all the networks so that he can have a viral moment attacking the credibility of an investigation,' Meadows added[50]. 'It was his client that refused to answer today. It was his client that has made a number of assertions that, quite frankly, are not being supported by the facts.' Simpson finds himself in the crosshairs of HouseJudiciary and Oversight Committee members after Justice Department official Bruce Ohr recently told lawmakers he met with the Fusion GPS co-founder prior to election day\u2014 an explosive detail in directconflict with Simpson's testimony last year. However, some Republicans say they aren't shocked that Simpson is now apprehensiveto speak to investigators. 'I'm not surprisedGlenn Simpson is taking the Fifth. He probably should,' Rep. John Ratcliffe, a member of the HouseJudiciary Committee, told[51] Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. 'He's in real legal jeopardy. Very clearly, someone is not telling the truth.' More[52] Treasury Employee Accused of Leaking Confidential Manafort Docs to BuzzFeed[53] The Deep State continues to be exposed Dave John Carney Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Federal prosecutors have charged a Treasury Department employee with leaking confidential banking reports to a reporter. Authorities say Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards was found witha flash drive containing the confidential reports when she was arrested Tuesday. The 40-year-old Edwards is a senior official at the department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. She's accused of leaking the material to a journalist. The court papers do not name the reporter or the media outlet. Prosecutors say reports on Paul Manafort, Richard Gates, and Maria Butina were among those leaked. Prosecutors allege Edwards photographed the confidential documents and sent them to the reporter using an encrypted messaging app. In February, BuzzFeed reported[54] that eight banks filed 23 'suspicious activity reports' between 2004 and 2014 for accounts linked to Manafort More[55] This interview goes through all the reasons why the Mueller investigation needs to endThe bottom line: Everything initially asserted to justify it has proven to be falseand nothing new has been uncovered since then to justify eitherTom Fitton on what to expect from Mueller probe[56]: Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ready to deliver key findings of the Russia probe after the midterm elections; reaction from Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. Establishment Media Reverse Course to Blast Elizabeth Warren over DNA Fiasco[57] This notice is provided as a public service messageto announce the end of Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign Dave John Nolte Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) roll-out of her DNA test has been such a train wreck that even the establishment media have been forced to reverse course and admit to it. As hard as the media worked to cover and lie[58] for her for over those first 24 hours, the unassailable facts have forced them to throw in the towel. The science is settled: Elizabeth Warren is a fake Indian. Here's a quick list of the headlines Warren is dealing with today: Washington Post[59]: 'Elizabeth Warren angers prominent Native Americans with politically fraught DNA test' CNN[60]: 'Elizabeth Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit' CBS News[61]: 'Elizabeth Warren criticized for releasing DNA report' Politico[62] (Politico!): 'Warren stumbles with 'Native American' rollout' HuffPost:[63] 'Why White Americans Love To Claim Native Ancestry' The Hill:[64] 'Dem strategist says Warren taking DNA test was 'tone deaf'' New York Times[65]: Elizabeth Warren's DNA Results Draw Rebuke from Trump and Raise Questions USA Today[66]: 'Cherokee Nation slams Sen. Elizabeth Warren DNA test as 'inappropriate and wrong'' Boston Globe[67]: Elizabeth Warren Defends Decision to Release DNA Test Compare those headlines to the headlines Monday morning when Warren rolled out her carefully planned assault on Trump using her DNA results. Keep in mind that part of Team Warren's careful planning involved alerting the media beforehand. This allowed every establishment media outlet to coordinate and execute a plan that would spin this into vindication and a big victory for Warren over Trump All of this is painfully obvious in these Monday morning headlines: ABC News:[68] 'Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry' AP[69]: 'Warren DNA shows Native American heritage' CNN[70]: 'Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with 'strong evidence' of Native American ancestry' BBC[71]: 'Elizabeth Warren: DNA test finds 'strong evidence' of Native American blood' USA Today[72]: 'Warren DNA shows Native American heritage' NBC News[73]: 'Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she has Native American heritage' Boston Globe[74]: 'Warren Reveals test Confirming Ancestry' Here is my favorite flip-flop The far-left Daily Beast on Monday:[75] 'BREAKING: Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test: Yes, she is Native American' The far-left Daily Beast on Wednesday[76]: 'Elizabeth Warren's DNA Stunt Alienates Native Americans' More[77] Andrew Gillum Graduated Training School That Spawned Soros Army of Revolutionaries[78] This Soros-sponsored training school answers the question'Where do those professionally-trained radicals keep coming from?' Dave Aaron Kline Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum graduated from an Oakland, California-based training school for progressive revolutionaries that has spawned a list of activists who have gone on to become the who's who of the far-left leadership world, with many taking senior positions at organizations financed by billionaire George Soros. In scores of cases, graduates of the Rockwood Leadership Institute founded or directed notorious Soros-financed activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org and the Tides Foundation, one of the nation's largest funders of progressive groups. Soros's own Open Society Foundations sent top staff to Rockwood for training. Notorious radicals Van Jones and Linda Sarsour are among the many famous names listed as alums. Gillum is listed[79] as a 2012 Rockwood alum. The Florida politician's involvement with the radical school was not cursory or symbolic. Only five months ago, Gillum boasted in a speech[80] to the Center for Environmental Health that he attended the institute 'for about a year and a half.' In that speech, Gillum talked about getting to know the Center for Environmental Health's director Michael Green while they both attended Rockwood together. Green is also listed as a 2012 alum along with Gillum. In 2013, Gillum, then a member of the Tallahassee City Commission, wrote that graduating the program in June of that year was a 'major milestone.' 'I will continue to use the tools and methodology in life and as I advance in my career and my role as a member of the City Commission,' he stated[81]. Gillum's Rockwood graduating class included such top activists as: Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, which was founded by Van Jones, President Obama's infamous former 'green' jobs czar. Jones stepped down[82] from his position after it was exposed that he was a founding organizer for the communist revolutionary group Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement (STORM). Soros has financed[83] Color of Change. Denise Collazo of the Soros-financed[84] radical PICO Network, which in its own terminology says[85] it is 'pushing for citizenship, and more, for an estimated 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States.' Mary Anne Hitt from the radical Sierra Club environmental activist organization. Nan Aron, president and founder of the Soros-funded[86] Alliance for Justice. Other notableRockwood alums are Van Jones; Jodie Evans, co-founder and executive director of Code Pink; several senior employees of Soros's own Open Society Foundations; and Drummond Pike, founder of the Soros-funded Tides Foundation. Radical Linda Sarsour is listed[87] as a Rockwood 'alum in the news,' as is Alicia Garza, co-founder of Black Lives Matter More[88] Biden: 'I hope' Democrats don't impeach Trump[89] Nicole Darrah Fox News October 17, 2018 Former Vice President Joe Biden said he doesn't think Democratic leadership should try to impeach President Trump if they win back the House of Representatives in the midterm elections. Biden, an oft-critical voice of Trump and his administration, told 'CBS This Morning'[90] in an interview released Wednesday that 'there's no basis' to introduce articles of impeachment for Trump. 'I hope they don't,' Biden said of the possible move by Democrats. 'I think we should wait until [Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report] comes out.' More[91] Two Minnesota Republican Candidates Reportedly Assaulted on Campaign Trail[92] Katherine Rodriguez Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Two Republican candidates running for office in Minnesota were reportedly assaulted in two incidents on the campaign trail this weekend. Police are currently investigating[93] the assaults on the candidates, who are both running campaigns for the Minnesota State House, after they each said during the weekend that they were attacked. Minnesota State Rep. Sarah Anderson (R-Plymouth) claimed one man who identified himself as an anarchist charged at her Sunday afternoon after she confronted him for kicking one of her campaign signs. Anderson said he kept her from shutting her car door before punching her in the arm. 'The idea that they will physically attack me, that is un-Minnesotan, that is not how we operate, and that's not how we solve problems in the state,' Anderson said. The other candidate, first-time Republican candidate Shane Mekeland of Benton County, claimed he suffered[94] a concussion after a man punched him without warning in a bar on Friday evening. The two were reportedly discussing taxes and health care when the unprovoked attack caused Mekeland to suffer a blow to the face. 'The last thing I heard is him say - I'll keep out the colorful language - 'You bleepin' people don't give a bleep about the middle class,'' Mekeland recalled. Mekeland said police already interviewed his alleged attacker, but police have not released his identity because no charges have been filed as of Wednesday. Both candidates said they would be continuing their campaign activities, albeit with extra caution.Mekeland is no longer conducting door-to-door activities alone, while Anderson said she has alerted her husband to her location at all times and is campaigning with volunteers More[95] Texas judge shuts down courtroom in protest of Kavanaugh confirmation[96] The unhinged behavior just keeps coming Dave Bradford Betz Fox News October 18, 2018 A Democratic judge in Texas is facing criticism for shutting down his courtroom and refusing to hear cases for one day to protest to the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, The Austin American-Statesman reported[97].  On Oct. 8 \u2014 two days after Kavanaugh's confirmation \u2014 Travis County Court-at-Law No. 3 Judge John Lipscombe draped black funeral bunting over the entrance to doors to his courtroom, the paper reported, citing a Twitter photo posted by KVUE-TV More[98] Cruz confronted by 2 protesters over his vote to confirm Kavanaugh[99] Lukas Mikelionis Fox News October 18, 2018 Two female protesters confronted Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at an airport on Wednesday over his vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a USA Today report [100]said. 'You think that putting a sexual assaulter on the court is a victory for women?' one protester asked the senator. 'You believe in men assaulting women. That's what your whole custom is, Senator.' Cruz went on to say that he believes in 'due process' for those accused, referring to the allegations from multiple women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the past with lack of corroborative evidence. 'You believe in due process? Lots of women were out there talking about their stories,' the protester replied. 'Do you believe in a man lying about his alcohol in front of the Senate and perjury? Do you believe in perjury?' the second protester joined in as Cruz was walking through the airport. 'Thank you for expressing your First Amendment rights,' Cruz responded, which prompted loud shouting by the second protester. 'Shame on you Ted Cruz!' the woman yelled multiple times.  This isn't the first time Cruz has been subjected to a confrontation[101] with protesters in public. Last month, activists stormed a Washington DC restaurant and shouted 'we believe survivors' as the Texas senator was sitting with his wife. One of the videos from the incident shows Cruz struggling to escape the hostile crowd amid chants and taunts. 'Excuse me, let my wife through,' Cruz is heard saying in the video. Cruz is currently running facing a tough re-election campaign against Democrat Beto O'Rourke. According to the multiple polls, Cruz is leading O'Rourke by seven points More[102] Soros-backed group fires operative after arrest over alleged battery against GOP campaign manager[103] Who is waging the 'war on women'??? Dave Brooke Singman, Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 17, 2018 A Democratic operative for American Bridge 21st Century, a group funded by liberal billionaire George Soros, was arrested after a female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee Adam Laxalt accused the operative of grabbing her arm and refusing to let go. The liberal group American Bridge 21st Century announced Wednesday night that it had fired one of its operatives a day after he was arrested and accused of battery against the female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. In a statement, American Bridge said that Mike Stark had been relieved of his duties 'effective immediately.' American Bridge wasfounded[104]in November 2010 by David Brock, who also founded liberal watchdog group Media Matters. The group's largest donor is liberal billionaire George Soros, who contributedmore than$2 million between 2015 and 2016. Soros is still involved with the group, most recently donating$300,000 in February,[105]and$80,000 last year.[106] Stark, 50, was arrested by Las Vegas city marshals Tuesday evening after 31-year-oldKristin Davison said he grabbed and twisted her arm, refusing to let go More[107] Trump hits the AP as media fact-check his nonstop interviews[108] Another fine case of the Mainstream Media misrepresenting what President Trump said Dave Howard Kurtz Fox News October 18, 2018 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the AP's misleading headline stating: 'Trump Tells AP He Won't Accept Blame If GOP Loses House.' As President Trump continues his midterm media blitz, he is sharpening his language against the press even as some of its practitioners ramp up their criticism of his claims. This was inevitable, given the sheer volume of words that the president is putting out there and the journalistic desire to fact-check the hell out of him. In one dispute, I have to say, Trump is basically right. While he is making this FBN week, with back-to-back sessions with Stuart Varney and Trish Regan of Fox Business Network, Trump also did a lengthy interview with the AP. It was a solid and substantive sitdown. But then the Associated Press slapped this headline on the story: 'Trump Tells AP He Won't Accept Blame If GOP Loses House.' That's pretty eye-catching, a preemptive alibi less than three weeks before the midterms. It got picked up by Drudge and a whole lot of other places. But it doesn't match what Trump said. Asked if he would accept any responsibility if the Democrats capture the House, the president responded: 'No, I think I'm helping people. They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero. Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement.' Come on: 'No, I think I'm helping people' is not even close to 'I won't accept responsibility if my party gets shellacked.' Trump didn't even address the possibility of the GOP losing the House. That's the wire-service equivalent of clickbait. (Though I'd like to see any candidate who went up 50 points [!] based on a Trumpian endorsement.) The president called the headline 'FAKE NEWS' on Twitter, and told Varney Tuesday: 'I get such phony news. Everything's a fake. Even yesterday I gave an interview to AP and the headline was totally different from everything I said. The headline was this terrible headline, everything else was perfect.'

ISIS-linked extremists in Nigeria kill 2nd of 3 abducted health workers[112] Frank Miles Fox News October 16, 2018 Islamic State-linked extremists in Nigeria have killed the second of three abducted health workers, Nigeria's government said late Monday \u2014 the death coming a month after the first health worker was killed by the Islamic State West Africa Province. The government identified her as Hauwa Mohammed Liman, who had been working in a hospital supported by the International Committee of the Red Cross. All three workers were seized in March in Nigeria's northeastern community of Rann, where thousands have sought shelter from the extremist threat that includes the Nigeria-based Boko Haram insurgency.

The answer from Twitter? Weasel words:'his message was not adverse to any policies currently in effect' We know this isn't trueAre they trying to tell us that Alex Jones[3] is worse than Farrakhan??? Dave Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News October 17, 2018 Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader who in a recent tweet said he was not prejudiced against Jewish people but was simply 'anti-Termite,' will be allowed to continue to use the social media platform. </p><p>Farrakhan took to the site[4] on Tuesday by posting a video of himself speaking at an event in Detroit, during which he addressed 'the members of the Jewish community that don't like me.' In a caption to the video, he wrote: 'I'm not an anti-Semite. I'm anti-Termite.' A Twitter spokesperson told BuzzFeed News[5] that Farrakhan's account on the platform would not be suspended because his message was not adverse to any policies currently in effect. Twitter told Fox News that Buzzfeed's report was accurate.  However, the outlet noted in their Wednesday report that Farrakhan's tweet infringed on the company's proposed 'dehumanization policy.[6]' Twitter announced via blog post on Sept. 25 that they were seeking 'feedback on a policy before it's part of the Twitter Rules.' For several months, the company was working on a new guideline to combat 'dehumanizing language' on the site, some of which they said was already included in their 'hateful conduct policy.' 'But there are still Tweets many people consider to be abusive, even when they do not break our rules,' the blog post said. 'With this change, we want to expand our hateful conduct policy to include content that dehumanizes others based on their membership in an identifiable group, even when the material does not include a direct target.'  The public survey was set to conclude on Oct. 9 and an update on the proposed policy's status would come 'later this year,' the blog post said. The company, which proposed prohibiting dehumanization of 'anyone based on membership in an identifiable group,' defined it as 'language that treats others as less than human.' The video and more[7] Gutfeld on Google's cowardice[8] Greg Gutfeld Fox News October 17, 2018 So while Google kills contracts that help our nation's defenses, opting instead to help China's artificial intelligence   Amazon puts America first. Despite getting flak from sheltered employees who think national security is for losers, CEO Jeff Bezos sticks to his guns. He recently said this,\u00a0'We are going to continue to support the DOD, and I think we should, it doesn't make any sense to me - sometimes, one of the jobs of senior leadership is to make the right decision, even when it's unpopular. And if big tech companies are going to turn their back on the U.S. Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.' Now compare that common sense to Google's virtue-signaling cowardice. First, Google suspended its contracts with our military when some workers whined about it.

It doesn't exist!The Saudi government is guilty of directing a gruesome murder and dismemberment Dave David Gauthier-Villars, Jessica Donati and Summer Said The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  ISTANBUL Saudi operatives beat, drugged, killed and dismembered a dissident Saudi journalist[11] in the presence of the kingdom's top diplomat in Istanbul, Turkish officials said Tuesday, as Washington urged Riyadh to provide answers. President Trump cautioned that Saudi Arabia should be considered innocent until proven guilty. His secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on a visit to the kingdom, said Saudi leaders had 'strongly denied' involvement and were conducting 'a serious and credible investigation.' The disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a former royal insider[12], has strained U.S.-Saudi ties[13] and sparked international outrage. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago. Saudi Arabia has denied any role in his disappearance. Mr. Trump has put Saudi Arabia and its crown prince at the center of a Middle East policy aimed at challenging Iran, Riyadh's main rival in the region, brokering an end to the Palestinian-Israeli crisis and countering extremism. Mr. Trump chose Saudi Arabia as the site of his first overseas presidential trip. The U.S. leader has emphasized the importance for U.S. jobs of the Saudi's purchasing of billions of dollars of U.S. military hardware.  In an interview with the Associated Press Tuesday, Mr. Trump compared the allegations that Saudi agents had killed Mr. Khashoggi to the accusations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh[14], who was sworn in last week after a bruising confirmation process. 'Here we go again with, you know, you're guilty until proven innocent,' Mr. Trump said. 'We just went through that with Justice Kavanaugh and he was innocent all the way as far as I'm concerned.' Turkish officials said they shared evidence in recent days, including the details of an audio recording[15], with both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia to support their conclusion that Mr. Khashoggi was killed at the hand of Saudi operatives[16]. It wasn't clear how Turkish officials had an audio recording. The recording indicates how Mr. Khashoggi was killed in the office of the Saudi consul general, Mohammad al-Otaibi, minutes after he walked into the consulate building on Oct. 2, said people familiar with the matter. Mr. Khashoggi wasn't interrogated, the people said. Instead, he was beaten up, drugged and killed by Saudi operatives who had flown in from Riyadh earlier in the day, the people said. Then, on the recording, a voice can be heard inviting the consul to leave the room, the people familiar with the matter said. The voice of a man Turkish authorities identified as Saudi forensic specialist Salah Al Tabiqi can be heard recommending other people present to listen to some music while he dismembered Mr. Khashoggi's body, the people said. Turkish investigators spent nine hours searching for clues inside the Saudi diplomatic premises on Monday and early Tuesday. Complicating the search, said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was the fact that some rooms had been freshly repainted. Tensions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia surfaced on Tuesday when Turkish investigators then sought to search the nearby consul's residence. In an unexpected development, Mr. Otaibi, the consul general, left Turkey for the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Tuesday afternoon and Saudi authorities informed Ankara that the residence was off limits, according to the people familiar with the matter. The latest Turkish allegations could complicate the Saudi government's efforts to provide an explanation of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi while distancing itself from any direct responsibility More[17] European Bank Officials Pull Out of Saudi Conference[18]: HSBC, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered and BNP Paribas chiefs are latest to withdraw after journalist's disappearance Margot Patrick and Jenny Strasburg The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  More banking executives pulled out of Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative conference Tuesday, with the heads of HSBC[19] HSBC -1.93% [20]Holdings PLC, Credit Suisse[21] CS -1.10% [22]Group AG and Standard Chartered PLC canceling plans to attend next week's event. This follows decisions this week by some of Wall Street's most prominent executives not to attend, amid a backlash against the kingdom[23] over the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Turkish officials say Mr. Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul this month. Saudi Arabia has denied the accusation[24]. The three bank chiefs pulled out Tuesday morning after discussing it among themselves, people familiar with the matter said. A fourth bank official, BNP Paribas [25]SA Chairman Jean Lemierre, later on Tuesday opted not to attend, as did London Stock Exchange Group[26] PLC CEO David Schwimmer. Global banks have been courting the Saudi government and its 33-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, the public face of the kingdom's effort to establish itself as a financial and investing hub. Last year's inaugural conference, billed as a 'Davos in the Desert,' was well attended by Western executives.  Skipping this year's conference could mean banks miss out on potentially lucrative transactions involving the Saudi government over the coming years. However, many of the banks with chief executives canceling their appearances are still sending delegations. HSBC Chief Executive John Flint had been scheduled to speak, and the bank was a strategic partner for this year's conference. The British bank part-owns a lender and has an investment-banking joint venture in the country.  Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam was on the conference's advisory board, while Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters was slated as a speaker.  Conference organizers have declined to comment on the cancellations and indicated the event would go forward as planned More[27] Saudi Money Flows Into Silicon Valley and With It Qualms[28]: The kingdom is now the largest single investor for U.S. startups, an unsettling fact for Silicon Valley If you are wondering why companies like Google, Facebook, and Twittershut down anyone who speaks against Islam[29]while permitting anti-Semites like Farrakhan to stay 'on the air'here is your answer Dave Eliot Brown and Greg Bensinger The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  As international backlash grows over Saudi Arabia's alleged involvement in the possible murder of a journalist[30], Silicon Valley faces a potentially unsettling fact: The kingdom is now the largest single funding source for U.S. startups. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has directed at least $11 billion of Saudi money into U.S. startups since mid-2016, either directly or through SoftBank Group[31] Corp.'s $92 billion tech-focused Vision Fund, to which the Saudis committed $45 billion[32], according to a Wall Street Journal estimate of data from research firm PitchBook. The total invested by the kingdom so far in U.S. startups is far bigger than the total raised by any single venture-capital fund.  Some of tech's most prominent young companies have welcomed Saudi money, including Uber Technologies Inc., office-sharing company WeWork Cos. and augmented-reality device maker Magic Leap Inc. For Uber, the situation could be particularly dicey: A prominent Saudi official sits on its board. For now, the companies are preferring to keep quiet about the escalating controversy. Of the 22 startups in which the Vision Fund or the Saudis have invested, all but one declined to comment or didn't respond to requests. Uber pointed to a recent statement from CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who said he planned to pull out of a Saudi-sponsored business conference and that he was troubled by the reports about the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi. For the startup community, 'there are incidents where you have to look and decide which side of history you want to be on, and if this is true, this is one of those,' said Venky Ganesan, former chairman of the National Venture Capital Association and an investor at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in Uber. 'It's more than about startups and money it's fundamentally about what you think about human rights.' Tech companies are in a particularly conflicted spot given the idealistic missions espoused by many leaders in Silicon Valley, where employees routinely rebel over contracts they find unprincipled. WeWork, for instance, has banned meat over concerns about its environmental impact. 'Silicon Valley has been incredibly hypocritical in accepting investments from an anti-Semitic country, [which] criminally punishes gays and de jure discriminates against women,' said Keith Rabois, a venture capitalist at prominent firm Khosla Ventures, in an email. Mr. Rabois's position also illustrates how pervasive Saudi money is: Multiple startups backed by Khosla have raised money from SoftBank's Saudi-backed Vision Fund, including online home-selling company Opendoor Labs Inc., of which he is a co-founder. SoftBank and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund declined to comment.  The sheer scale of money is unprecedented and to some founders, irresistible. The Saudi-backed Vision Fund where the majority of investment decisions are made solely by SoftBank has led at least 20 deals totaling more than $17 billion of investment in U.S. startups, according to PitchBook. Saudi's Public Investment Fund has committed another $4.9 billion to Uber, Magic Leap and electric-car maker Lucid Motors Inc. After Uber co-founder and then-CEO Travis Kalanick flew to the kingdom to meet with the crown prince two years ago, he secured a $3.5 billion investment from PIF[33] within weeks, people familiar with the matter have said. A condition of the deal: The PIF would receive a board seat More[34] Elite American soldiers, intelligence operatives hired to assassinate targets in Yemen in 2015[35] Saudi oil wealth, and it's strategic importance regarding oilhave been leading American leaders around by the noseboth inside and outside of government Dave Lucia I. Suarez Sang Fox News October 17, 2018 Saudi-led coalition airstrike hits bus carrying several children; Greg Palkot reports on the latest in the deadly civil war. A group of Americans who had been elite soldiers or intelligence operatives were paid tens of thousands of dollars\u00a0by the United Arab Emirates to assassinate political leaders and Islamic clerics in Yemen in 2015, a new report says. According to a BuzzFeed[36] reported published Tuesday, the Delaware-incorporated Spear Operations Group recruited top veterans from the U.S. military after Spear was hired by the UAE to conduct a series of targeted killings for $1.5 million per month. The soldiers who allegedly signed on to do the dirty work were offered more than $25,000 a month. 'There was a targeted assassination program in Yemen,' Spear founder Abraham Golan, told BuzzFeed. 'I was running it. We did it. It was sanctioned by the UAE within the coalition.' Golan, a Hungarian-Israeli security contractor who lives outside of Pittsburgh, was referencing the Saudi-led band of nine countries fighting a proxy war against Iran in Yemen. The U.S. has helped the coalition by providing weapons, intelligence\u00a0and other items, the report said.  More than 10,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in the conflict since the coalition intervened in 2015 The video and more[37] Private-Equity Firm Abraaj Raised Billions Pledging to Do Good Then It Fell Apart[38]: Western investors poured money into the Dubai-based group, now the world's largest insolvent private-equity firm Do-gooder liberal globalist elites believed their own Islam-friendly propagandaand got burned Bill Gates doesn't look so smart nowadays, does he? Dave Simon Clark, Nicolas Parasie and William Louch The Wall Street Journal Oct. 16, 2018  In January, the Abraaj Group had $14 billion of assets under management and was trying to raise $6 billion for what would be the world's largest emerging-markets private-equity fund. It's now the world's largest insolvent private-equity firm. In June, it filed for provisional liquidation[39]. During its rise, the Dubai-based firm attracted many Western investors. Its founder, Arif Naqvi, promised to make money by doing good in poorer countries, including with a fund that would invest in hospitals serving African and Asian cities. Abraaj's fall stands as a warning to those misled in their enthusiasm for the idea behind the firm. One former employee described Abraaj's work as 'inspirational capitalism at its most enlightened.' Signs of trouble went overlooked, with one investor receiving an anonymous email alleging problems at Abraaj.  The collapse has led some investors to question whether Dubai's regulatory environment is sufficiently safe[40] and privately, some worry it has damaged trust in the movement to use private capital to solve social problems in emerging markets. Mr. Naqvi raised billions from the likes of the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, Bank of America[41] Corp. and the U.S. government. He made annual appearances at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and sponsored the Clinton Foundation's 2012 summit in New York. Abraaj marketing documents touted 17% net annual returns. Mr. Naqvi himself started a $100 million charity in his home country of Pakistan, and funded students attacked by the Taliban. He accumulated estates in England and France, a $20 million yacht, a private jet and Asian and Middle Eastern art. Some details of the collapse are known: Abraaj used investor funds for its own expenses, according to former executives and investors. The firm further muddied its finances with the 'unusual practice' of borrowing money[42] secured against its own stakes in its funds, creating 'a highly unstable business model,' liquidators wrote in a report. Abraaj has defaulted on more than $1 billion of debt More[43] State Department provided 'clearly false' statements to derail requests for Clinton docs, 'shocked' federal judge says[44] Gregg Re Fox News October 17, 2018 In a combative exchange at a hearing\u00a0Friday in Washington, D.C., a\u00a0federal judge unabashedly accused career State Department officials of lying and signing 'clearly false' affidavits to derail a series of lawsuits seeking information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server and her handling of the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said he was 'shocked' and\u00a0'dumbfounded' when he learned that FBI\u00a0had granted immunity to former Clinton chief of staff Cheryl Mills[45] during its investigation into the use of Clinton's server, according to a court transcript of his remarks. 'I had myself found that Cheryl Mills had committed perjury and lied under oath in a published opinion I had issued in a Judicial Watch case where I found her unworthy of belief, and I was quite shocked to find out she had been given immunity in   by the Justice Department in the Hillary Clinton email case,' Lamberth said during Friday's hearing. The Department of Justice's Inspector General\u00a0(IG), Michael Horowitz, noted in a bombshell report[46] in June that it was 'inconsistent with typical investigative strategy' for the FBI to allow Mills to sit in during the agency's interview of Clinton during the email probe, given that classified information traveled through\u00a0Mills' personal email account. '[T]here are serious potential ramifications when one witness attends another witness' interview,' the IG wrote.  On Friday, Lamberth,\u00a0who was appointed to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, said he\u00a0did not know Mills had been granted immunity until he 'read the IG report and learned that and that she had accompanied [Clinton] to her interview.' The transparency group Judicial Watch initially sued the State Department in 2014, seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack after the government didn't respond to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. Other parallel lawsuits by Judicial Watch are probing issues like Clinton's server, whose existence\u00a0was revealed\u00a0during the course of the litigation. The State Department had immediately moved to dismiss Judicial Watch's first lawsuit on a motion for summary judgment, saying in an affidavit that it had conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails in its possession and provided them.\u00a0The affidavit noted that some more documents and emails could be forthcoming. But Lamberth denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit at the time   and on Friday, he said he was happy he did, charging that State Department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents, including those on Clinton's email server, had not in fact been produced. 'It\u00a0was clear to me that at the time that I ruled initially, that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials, and it became more clear through discovery that the information that I was provided was clearly false regarding the adequacy of the search and this - what we now know turned out to be the Secretary's email system,' Lamberth said Friday More[47] Fusion GPS Founder Glenn Simpson Pleads the Fifth Before House Investigators[48] Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Glenn Simpson, the co-founder of Fusion GPS,\u00a0the opposition research firm behind the infamous Steele dosser, invoked his Fifth Amendment\u00a0rights before House investigators on Tuesday. Simpson's attorney, Josh Levy, decried a joint committee investigation into potential political bias in the Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) during the 2016 presidential election as\u00a0McCarthyism. 'This committee would make Sen. Joseph McCarthy proud,' Levy told[49] reporters on Capitol Hill. 'Like Sen. McCarthy, this committee has largely conducted its business through secret, confidential interviews and depositions, binding witnesses and their counsels into silence while the members walk outside to all of you the media with public and selectively leaked interviews to tell you what they want you to hear.' Reacting to Levy's comments, Freedom Caucus leader Mark Meadows (R-NC) said, 'You can't just invoke the fifth in order to avoid questions before Congress.' 'Mr. Levy is looking for a moment on all the networks so that he can have a viral moment attacking the credibility of an investigation,' Meadows added[50]. 'It was his client that refused to answer today. It was his client that has made a number of assertions that, quite frankly, are not being supported by the facts.' Simpson finds himself in the crosshairs of House\u00a0Judiciary and Oversight Committee members after Justice Department official Bruce Ohr recently told lawmakers he met with the Fusion GPS co-founder prior to election day\u00a0  an explosive detail in direct\u00a0conflict with Simpson's testimony last year. However, some Republicans say they aren't shocked that Simpson is now apprehensive\u00a0to speak to investigators. 'I'm not surprised\u00a0Glenn Simpson is taking the Fifth. He probably should,' Rep. John Ratcliffe, a member of the House\u00a0Judiciary Committee, told[51] Fox News host Maria Bartiromo on Sunday. 'He's in real legal jeopardy. Very clearly, someone is not telling the truth.'

Authorities say Natalie Mayflower Sours Edwards was found with\u00a0a flash drive containing the confidential reports when she was arrested Tuesday. The 40-year-old Edwards is a senior official at the department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. She's accused of leaking the material to a journalist. The court papers do not name the reporter or the media outlet. Prosecutors say reports on Paul Manafort, Richard Gates, and Maria Butina were among those leaked. Prosecutors allege Edwards photographed the confidential documents and sent them to the reporter using an encrypted messaging app. In February, BuzzFeed reported[54] that eight banks filed 23 'suspicious activity reports' between 2004 and 2014 for accounts linked to Manafort More[55] This interview goes through all the reasons why the Mueller investigation needs to endThe bottom line: Everything initially asserted to justify it has proven to be falseand nothing new has been uncovered since then to justify eitherTom Fitton on what to expect from Mueller probe[56]: Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ready to deliver key findings of the Russia probe after the midterm elections; reaction from Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton. Establishment Media Reverse Course to Blast Elizabeth Warren over DNA Fiasco[57] This notice is provided as a public service messageto announce the end of Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential campaign Dave John Nolte Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-MA) roll-out of her DNA test has been such a train wreck that even the establishment media have been forced to reverse course and admit to it. As hard as the media worked to cover and lie[58] for her for over those first 24 hours, the unassailable facts have forced them to throw in the towel. The science is settled: Elizabeth Warren is a fake Indian. Here's a quick list of the headlines Warren is dealing with today: Washington Post[59]: 'Elizabeth Warren angers prominent Native Americans with politically fraught DNA test' CNN[60]: 'Elizabeth Warren might have actually made things worse with her DNA gambit' CBS News[61]: 'Elizabeth Warren criticized for releasing DNA report' Politico[62] (Politico!): 'Warren stumbles with 'Native American' rollout' HuffPost:[63] 'Why White Americans Love To Claim Native Ancestry' The Hill:[64] 'Dem strategist says Warren taking DNA test was 'tone deaf'' New York Times[65]: Elizabeth Warren's DNA Results Draw Rebuke from Trump and Raise Questions USA Today[66]: 'Cherokee Nation slams Sen.

Keep in mind that part of Team Warren's careful planning involved alerting the media beforehand. This allowed every establishment media outlet to coordinate and execute a plan that would spin this into vindication and a big victory for Warren over Trump All of this is painfully obvious in these Monday morning headlines: ABC News:[68] 'Elizabeth Warren reveals proof of Native American ancestry' AP[69]: 'Warren DNA shows Native American heritage' CNN[70]: 'Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test with 'strong evidence' of Native American ancestry' BBC[71]: 'Elizabeth Warren: DNA test finds 'strong evidence' of Native American blood' USA Today[72]: 'Warren DNA shows Native American heritage' NBC News[73]: 'Elizabeth Warren releases DNA results indicating she has Native American heritage' Boston Globe[74]: 'Warren Reveals test Confirming Ancestry' Here is my favorite flip-flop The far-left Daily Beast on Monday:[75] 'BREAKING: Elizabeth Warren releases her DNA test: Yes, she is Native American' The far-left Daily Beast on Wednesday[76]: 'Elizabeth Warren's DNA Stunt Alienates Native Americans' More[77] Andrew Gillum Graduated Training School That Spawned Soros Army of Revolutionaries[78] This Soros-sponsored training school answers the question'Where do those professionally-trained radicals keep coming from?' Dave Aaron Kline Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Florida gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum graduated from an Oakland, California-based training school for progressive revolutionaries that has spawned a list of activists who have gone on to become the who's who of the far-left leadership world, with many taking senior positions at organizations financed by billionaire George Soros. In scores of cases, graduates of the Rockwood Leadership Institute founded or directed notorious Soros-financed activist groups, such as Black Lives Matter, Media Matters for America, MoveOn.org and the Tides Foundation, one of the nation's largest funders of progressive groups. Soros's own Open Society Foundations sent top staff to Rockwood for training. Notorious radicals Van Jones and Linda Sarsour are among the many famous names listed as alums. Gillum is listed[79] as a 2012 Rockwood alum. The Florida politician's involvement with the radical school was not cursory or symbolic. Only five months ago, Gillum boasted in a speech[80] to the Center for Environmental Health that he attended the institute 'for about a year and a half.' In that speech, Gillum talked about getting to know the Center for Environmental Health's director Michael Green while they both attended Rockwood together. Green is also listed as a 2012 alum along with Gillum. In 2013, Gillum, then a member of the Tallahassee City Commission, wrote that graduating the program in June of that year was a 'major milestone.' 'I will continue to use the tools and methodology in life and as I advance in my career and my role as a member of the City Commission,' he stated[81]. Gillum's Rockwood graduating class included such top activists as: Rashad Robinson, executive director of Color of Change, which was founded by Van Jones, President Obama's infamous former 'green' jobs czar. Jones stepped down[82] from his position after it was exposed that he was a founding organizer for the communist revolutionary group Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement (STORM). Soros has financed[83] Color of Change.

Biden, an oft-critical voice of Trump and his administration, told 'CBS This Morning'[90] in an interview released Wednesday that 'there's no basis' to introduce articles of impeachment for Trump. 'I hope they don't,' Biden said of the possible move by Democrats. 'I think we should wait until [Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report] comes out.' More[91] Two Minnesota Republican Candidates Reportedly Assaulted on Campaign Trail[92] Katherine Rodriguez Breitbart News 17 Oct 2018 Two Republican candidates running for office in Minnesota were reportedly assaulted in two incidents on the campaign trail this weekend. Police are currently investigating[93] the assaults on the candidates, who are both running campaigns for the Minnesota State House, after they each said during the weekend that they were attacked. Minnesota State Rep. Sarah Anderson (R-Plymouth) claimed one man who identified himself as an anarchist charged at her Sunday afternoon after she confronted him for kicking one of her campaign signs. Anderson said he kept her from shutting her car door before punching her in the arm. 'The idea that they will physically attack me, that is un-Minnesotan, that is not how we operate, and that's not how we solve problems in the state,' Anderson said. The other candidate, first-time Republican candidate Shane Mekeland of Benton County, claimed he suffered[94] a concussion after a man punched him without warning in a bar on Friday evening. The two were reportedly discussing taxes and health care when the unprovoked attack caused Mekeland to suffer a blow to the face. 'The last thing I heard is him say - I'll keep out the colorful language - 'You bleepin' people don't give a bleep about the middle class,'' Mekeland recalled. Mekeland said police already interviewed his alleged attacker, but police have not released his identity because no charges have been filed as of Wednesday. Both candidates said they would be continuing their campaign activities, albeit with extra caution.\u00a0Mekeland is no longer conducting door-to-door activities alone, while Anderson said she has alerted her husband to her location at all times and is campaigning with volunteers More[95] Texas judge shuts down courtroom in protest of Kavanaugh confirmation[96] The unhinged behavior just keeps coming Dave Bradford Betz Fox News October 18, 2018 A Democratic judge in Texas is facing criticism for shutting down his courtroom and refusing to hear cases for one day to protest to the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, The Austin American-Statesman reported[97].

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, at an airport on Wednesday over his vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a USA Today report [100]said. 'You think that putting a sexual assaulter on the court is a victory for women?' one protester asked the senator. 'You believe in men assaulting women. That's what your whole custom is, Senator.' Cruz went on to say that he believes in 'due process' for those accused, referring to the allegations from multiple women accusing Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct in the past with lack of corroborative evidence. 'You believe in due process? Lots of women were out there talking about their stories,' the protester replied. 'Do you believe in a man lying about his alcohol in front of the Senate and perjury? Do you believe in perjury?' the second protester joined in as Cruz was walking through the airport. 'Thank you for expressing your First Amendment rights,' Cruz responded, which prompted loud shouting by the second protester. 'Shame on you Ted Cruz!' the woman yelled multiple times.  This isn't the first time Cruz has been subjected to a confrontation[101] with protesters in public. Last month, activists stormed a Washington DC restaurant and shouted 'we believe survivors' as the Texas senator was sitting with his wife. One of the videos from the incident shows Cruz struggling to escape the hostile crowd amid chants and taunts. 'Excuse me, let my wife through,' Cruz is heard saying in the video. Cruz is currently running facing a tough re-election campaign against Democrat Beto O'Rourke.

Dave Brooke Singman, Samuel Chamberlain Fox News October 17, 2018 A Democratic operative for American Bridge 21st Century, a group funded by liberal billionaire George Soros, was arrested after a female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial nominee Adam Laxalt accused the operative of grabbing her arm and refusing to let go. The liberal group American Bridge 21st Century announced Wednesday night that it had fired one of its operatives a day after he was arrested and accused of battery against the female campaign manager for Nevada GOP gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt. In a statement, American Bridge said that Mike Stark had been relieved of his duties 'effective immediately.' American Bridge was\u00a0founded\u00a0[104]in November 2010 by David Brock, who also founded liberal watchdog group Media Matters. The group's largest donor is liberal billionaire George Soros, who contributed\u00a0more than\u00a0$2 million between 2015 and 2016. Soros is still involved with the group, most recently donating\u00a0$300,000 in February,[105]\u00a0and\u00a0$80,000 last year.[106] Stark, 50, was arrested by Las Vegas city marshals Tuesday evening after 31-year-old\u00a0Kristin Davison said he grabbed and twisted her arm, refusing to let go More[107] Trump hits the AP as media fact-check his nonstop interviews[108] Another fine case of the Mainstream Media misrepresenting what President Trump said Dave Howard Kurtz Fox News October 18, 2018 'MediaBuzz' host Howard Kurtz weighs in on the AP's misleading headline stating: 'Trump Tells AP He Won't Accept Blame If GOP Loses House.' As President Trump continues his midterm media blitz, he is sharpening his language against the press even as some of its practitioners ramp up their criticism of his claims. This was inevitable, given the sheer volume of words that the president is putting out there and the journalistic desire to fact-check the hell out of him. In one dispute, I have to say, Trump is basically right. While he is making this FBN week, with back-to-back sessions with Stuart Varney and Trish Regan of Fox Business Network, Trump also did a lengthy interview with the AP. It was a solid and substantive sitdown. But then the Associated Press slapped this headline on the story: 'Trump Tells AP He Won't Accept Blame If GOP Loses House.' That's pretty eye-catching, a preemptive alibi less than three weeks before the midterms. It got picked up by Drudge and a whole lot of other places. But it doesn't match what Trump said. Asked if he would accept any responsibility if the Democrats capture the House, the president responded: 'No, I think I'm helping people. They would say that in the old days that if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support of somebody it would be nice to have, but it meant nothing, zero. Like literally zero. Some of the people I've endorsed have gone up 40 and 50 points just on the endorsement.' Come on: 'No, I think I'm helping people' is not even close to 'I won't accept responsibility if my party gets shellacked.' Trump didn't even address the possibility of the GOP losing the House. That's the wire-service equivalent of clickbait. (Though I'd like to see any candidate who went up 50 points [!] based on a Trumpian endorsement.) The president called the headline 'FAKE NEWS' on Twitter, and told Varney Tuesday: 'I get such phony news. Everything's a fake.

Youssef The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  ISLAMABAD\u2014Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. and Pakistan have still got a long way to go to reset troubled ties after a visit in which he sought Islamabad's help in ending the war in Afghanistan. Relations have soured amid differences over Afghanistan, the presence of militants on Pakistani soil, Washington's burgeoning relationship with India and Pakistan's ever-closer ties with China. The two sides didn't reach any concrete agreements during the five-hour visit to Pakistan's capital on Wednesday, but Mr. Pompeo said there were 'a lot more discussions to be had' as he boarded a flight to India after meeting with Pakistan's new leaders. </p><p>'We need to begin to do things that will actually on the ground deliver outcomes so that we can build confidence and trust. That was the focus,'he said. Washington has long accused Pakistan of providing sanctuary to the Afghan Taliban and other jihadist groups, a charge Islamabad denies. However, Washington has recently shifted its focus from fighting the Taliban to wanting to forge a peace deal. Pakistan and new Prime Minister Imran Khan have consistently called for a political settlement with the Taliban that would give the group a share of the government in Afghanistan.  The shape of any peace deal remains unclear. U.S. officials met with Taliban representatives[8] in the Gulf state of Qatar in July, but there is no word on further talks. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi described Wednesday's talks as positive. He assured the U.S. side of full support in bringing the Taliban into peace negotiations. 'Our future is linked to Afghanistan. The future of our children is linked to Afghanistan,'Mr. Qureshi said. 'My peace and stability is linked to Afghan peace and stability.' But Mr. Qureshi warned that if the U.S. wanted Pakistan to focus on its western border with Afghanistan, it would need to help ease tension on its eastern border with India. India and Pakistan remain in a nuclear-armed standoff, with frequent exchange of gunfire across their disputed border in the Kashmir region. Pakistan also accuses India of using Afghan soil to support terrorists against Pakistan, an allegation New Delhi denies. Islamabad believes that in recent years, Washington has abandoned its decades-old alliance with Islamabad in favor of India. President Trump, setting out his South Asia strategy last year, blamed Pakistan for giving sanctuary to terrorists and extending the war in Afghanistan. At the start of 2018, his administration suspended security aid to Islamabad in an attempt to pressure Pakistan to act against militants. Pakistan says it has taken action against all extremist groups and that no terrorist havens remain in its territory. The U.S. doesn't agree, and the Trump administration has been pointed in saying so More[9] U.S., India Sign Military-Intelligence-Sharing Agreement[10] India needs - and can rely on - the United States much more than IranThere is an opportunity for the U.S. to replace Iran as a source of oil for India Even if we had to subsidize oil to India, this would be a far safer and cheaper wayto defeat Iran than American blood and weapons Dave Rajesh Roy and Nancy A. Youssef The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  NEW DELHI\u2014The U.S. and India signed an agreement Thursday to usher in closer military and intelligence cooperation[11] between the world's largest democracies. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with their Indian counterparts, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a high-level meeting aimed at deepening ties between the two countries. The two sides signed an agreement to allow the sharing of encrypted military intelligence. The U.S. required India to sign the so-called Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement if it wants to buy America's most advanced military equipment. 'Our discussions have paved the way for a new era in India-U.S. defense and strategic engagement,' said Ms. Sitharaman. 'The agreement will enable India to access advanced technologies from the U.S. and enhance India's defense preparedness.' The countries have been striving to tighten ties as China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance, broadcasting its economic and military might across Asia. India is now one of the biggest buyers of arms from the U.S. Trade between the two countries has grown in recent years, and U.S. companies including Walmart[12] Inc. and Amazon.com[13] Inc. have invested billions of dollars in the Indian economy. U.S. sanctions against Iran and Russia have put India in a difficult position[14] as it sees both nations as important economic and strategic partners. On Thursday, the two sides also discussed the ramifications of U.S. sanctions against Iran. India says it needs a waiver or more time as it relies on Iran for 10% of its energy supply, mainly in the form of oil imports. The U.S., however, insists the imports from Iran be eliminated by Nov. 4. 'We have told the Indian side consistently, as we have told every nation, that sanctions from Nov. 4 will be enforced.' Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference after the meeting  More[15] Iran Defies U.S. Bid to Curb Its Middle East Influence[16]: Tehran has kept up the flow of arms and financial support to proxy forces even as Washington pressures Iran's economy  Sune Engel Rasmussen in Beirut and Michael R. Gordon in Washington The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Iran is signaling that it will buck U.S. efforts to roll back its military presence in the Middle East, moving to cement foreign alliances and continuing to project power abroad despite sanctions that have helped put intense pressure on its economy[17]. Tehran signed a long-term security pact with Syria[18] in August, and has kept up the flow of arms and financial support to proxy forces around the region, according to U.S. officials and a person close to Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. On Sunday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a meeting with air force commanders that Iran needed to boost its personnel and buy more equipment, though he said a war was unlikely. He didn't elaborate. Iran's defiant stance comes as its currency plummets[19] and foreign investors pull out, largely due to rising tension between Washington and Tehran. In May, President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal[20], which administration officials indicated was part of a broader effort to curtail Iran's activities in the Middle East, and said he was reimposing sanctions.  'In my judgment, what Iran is doing today is simply a continuation of what they have been doing for a long time, which is to harden themselves, build what alliances they can and prepare for the day' when conflict with the U.S. might erupt, Lt. Gen. Michael Nagata of the National Counterterrorism Center said at a conference Wednesday hosted by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank More[21] Iraqi Protesters Torch Iranian Consulate[22]: Baghdad's Green Zone, Iran-backed militias were also attacked  President Trump's plan for getting Iran out of Syria and Iraq is working beautifullyBy taking Iran to the brink of financial collapseTrump is causing Iran to lose its ability to project power If Iran can't pay for compliance and suppressionthe wheels come off of its foreign adventures Dave Isabel Coles and Ali Nabhan The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  DUBAI\u2014Protesters set fire to the Iranian consulate in Basra on Friday in a show of anger against Tehran's involvement in the country's affairs, capping days of violent unrest that has raised fears of a broader conflict. The torching of the Iranian consulate came hours after three mortar rounds were fired early Friday morning into the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad where the U.S. embassy is located, landing in an empty lot and causing no damage. Hours before on Thursday night, protesters had torched the offices of most political parties in Basra, including powerful Iran-backed paramilitary groups. Protests began last week over poor government services, but they have flared into violent rejections of the entire political class and foreign influence. The U.S. and Iran are vying for leverage as Iraqi politicians reconvene parliament and attempt to form a new government following May elections More[23] Iraq to Investigate Protesters' Deaths as Anger Grows[24]  Five men were killed as hundreds demonstrated in Basra about poor government services  Ghassan Adnan and Ali Nabhan The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  DUBAI\u2014Iraq's government opened an investigation into the deaths of five men allegedly killed by security forces, as continuing protests against poor government services underscored the growing public anger[25] against the country's political class. The demonstrations turned deadly when security forces tried to disperse the crowd gathered outside the Basra provincial council building late Tuesday to protest the death of a demonstrator on Monday. The violence comes amid growing public anger against a political class that continues to wrangle over government formation[26] four months after parliamentary elections, while ordinary Iraqis struggle with electricity[27] and water shortages. Mahdi al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi human rights commission's Basra office, said security forces were to blame for the deaths and noted they had shot to kill. 'The bullet wounds are all above the waist,' he said. The interior ministry didn't confirm or deny the protesters' deaths at the hands of security forces but rejected the use of live ammunition. 'The matter is being investigated and we ask protesters not to assault public property.' Iraq's health ministry said 67 people were wounded, including 27 members of the security forces, but didn't state how. Iraq already faces a daunting list of challenges after three years of war[28] against Islamic State\u2014not least rebuilding devastated areas and preventing the militants who have retreated back underground from regaining traction. Protests in Basra flared in recent days after thousands of people fell ill because the water supply was contaminated, reigniting demonstrations that posed a serious challenge to the government earlier this summer. 'Suddenly things turned violent,' said Ahmed Hadi, who was watching Tuesday's protests from his carpenter's shop near the provincial council building. 'People were throwing water bottles at the security forces and there was gunfire everywhere.' Security forces eventually withdrew from the provincial council building following which, the protesters broke in and torched it, according to Mr. Hadi and local officials More[29] Should Pakistan's attitudes toward blasphemy against Islam apply in the Netherlands?[30]  After protests thousands of miles away, an anti-Islam politician cancels a cartoon contest. The global elites who created a media echo chamber favoring globalismnever bothered to tell us of its dark side The net effect of globalism is that the most oppressive regimes in the worldwill effectively determine the laws that other nations must live by Without borders, what stop the censorship laws of China from migrating to America?What prevents the blasphemy laws of Pakistan from coming here too? This issue has been hammering us for decadesbut it has been concealed by the terms 'political correctness' and 'hate speech'so that the public wouldn't realize its repressive foreign origins Instead of joking about these terms, it is time for us to defend our borders from them This means that we must call out the media 'masters of the universe' on their tacticof selling out American freedoms to gain access to lucrative markets in oppressive nations[31]and make acceptance of American freedoms a condition for moving to the U.S Adherence to Islam fundamentally prohibits free speech[32]and on that basis should be treated as a threat Dave Death Penalty News Friday, September 07, 2018  Should Pakistan's attitudes toward blasphemy against Islam apply in the Netherlands? This is the crux of a recent controversy involving the flamboyant politician Geert Wilders of the anti-Islam Dutch Freedom Party. Last week, citing security concerns, Mr. Wilders canceled a proposed cartoon contest in Holland whose participants were invited to lampoon the prophet Muhammad. The cancellation followed protests in Pakistan as well as a spate of death threats from Pakistani celebrities and religious figures. On Aug. 28, Dutch police in The Hague arrested a 26-year-old Pakistani man who had threatened to attack Mr. Wilders and the Dutch Parliament. The Pakistani government considers the cartoon contest's cancellation a triumph. In a press conference, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry gave his country credit for Mr. Wilders's climb-down. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi hailed it as 'a great moral victory for the Muslim ummah,' the world-wide community of believers. In reality, the incident marks a setback for Pakistan's new government. By pandering to strident Islamists, Prime Minister Imran Khan deepens fears that his election in July strengthens fundamentalism in the nuclear-armed country. Rather than helping Muslims, Pakistani bullying will likely boost anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe. Mr. Wilders, for instance, has long called for an end to Muslim immigration to his country on the grounds that Islam is not compatible with the West. In Pakistan, so-called blasphemy against Islam carries the death penalty. Sometimes a mere accusation can lead an enraged mob to lynch a supposed offender. Religious minorities, including Christians and members of the beleaguered Ahmadiyya Muslim sect, often bear the brunt of these attacks. Instead of seeking to export this backward sensibility to Holland, Mr. Khan ought to use his bully pulpit to tamp down wild expectations from his people. No reasonable person grudges Pakistanis their right to revere Muhammad. And Mr. Wilders, whose political career has been defined by tasteless attacks on Muslims, is not exactly a sympathetic figure. But this does not give Pakistanis the right to set the boundaries of free speech in Holland More[33] Trump on the Potential for a Government Shutdown: 'If It Happens, It Happens'[34]  Current government funding expires at the end of the month, as president presses for funds for Mexico border wall  Vivian Salama and Kristina Peterson The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014President Trump on Wednesday wouldn't rule out a government shutdown at month's end, despite a full-court press from congressional leaders to avoid a politically damaging showdown just weeks before November's midterm elections. 'If it happens, it happens,' said Mr. Trump, who is intent on securing more funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The government's current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Oct. 1, and congressional GOP leaders have been trying for weeks to persuade Mr. Trump to avoid any legislative drama that could jeopardize their prospects of retaining GOP majorities in both chambers. Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he was confident he would not need to direct Mr. Trump away from a government shutdown. 'That's not in anyone's interest, and he knows that,' Mr. Ryan told reporters. But shortly before a meeting with the Republican House and Senate leadership Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said that 'if it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything' to secure it. 'We have to protect our borders,' he added. GOP aides said after the meeting with Mr. Trump that they remained confident the government wouldn't be closed. Mr. Trump has frequently shifted his position on legislation, including threatening to veto a spending bill which he ultimately signed.  Both chambers have passed a series of their own spending bills for the coming fiscal year, which they hope to negotiate and pass packaged into clusters of several bills at a time. But to avoid a fight over wall funding now, they plan to tackle the Department of Homeland Security's funding later in the year. 'We still want to get funding for the wall, but we think the best time to have that discussion is after the election,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on Fox News Wednesday evening. He predicted there was 'zero' chance of a shutdown  More[35] Twitter Permanently Bans Alex Jones After New Violations[36]  Twitter said the right-wing provocateur had violated its 'abusive-behavior policy'  It didn't take long for Dorsey to buckle to liberal peer pressure, did it?That is where the real danger lies Dave Yoree Koh The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Twitter[37] Inc. on Thursday said it permanently banned Alex Jones and his website Infowars, effectively taking away one of the last few online microphones available to the right-wing provocateur. While other tech companies including Apple[38] Inc., Facebook[39] Inc. and Alphabet[40] Inc.'s YouTube previously suspended various accounts associated to Mr. Jones, Twitter had allowed him to remain on its platform. Twitter said Thursday[41] its decision was based on reports of tweets and videos Mr. Jones posted in the past 24 hours 'that violate our abusive-behavior policy, in addition to the accounts' past violations.'  Among his recent posts was one video in which he berated and insulted a CNN reporter. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr. Jones for seven days for violating its content policy. Mr. Jones frequently touts discredited conspiracy theories, most notably labeling as a hoax the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children Tech companies have had a tortured relationship with Mr. Jones, who has repeatedly tested their commitment to free expression on their platforms. The issue came to a head last month when Apple removed links to content from Infowars and eliminated access to five Infowars podcasts, including 'The Alex Jones Show,' from its directory. Next, YouTube eliminated channels related to Infowars and Facebook erased four pages run by Mr. Jones. Following those actions, Mr. Jones has argued that Silicon Valley is suppressing his First Amendment rights and trying to muzzle conservative viewpoints Twitter's move to permanently remove Mr. Jones from the site came a day after its CEO, Jack Dorsey, testified before Congress on election interference and potential political bias against conservatives that impacts how content is shown to users Mr. Dorsey has said the company is trying to improve how it enforces its policies and articulates them to users. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Mr. Dorsey at times has frustrated some staffers[42] by weighing in at the last minute on enforcement decisions. The firm said he is involved in the decision-making but doesn't overrule the decisions of his team. Mr. Dorsey's involvement in such high-profile decisions wouldn't be unique. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was personally involved in the company's decision last month to suspend Mr. Jones's accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg's role in the decision.  Last month, Mr. Dorsey defended his firm's decision not to ban Mr. Jones  More[43] Justice Department to Examine Whether Social-Media Giants Are 'Intentionally Stifling' Some Viewpoints[44]  Move announced as Facebook's Sandberg and Twitter's Dorsey defend their platforms Deepa Seetharaman, Dustin Volz and John D. McKinnon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Even as top executives at Facebook[45] and Twitter[46] attempted to fend off questions from senators about election interference on their platforms, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he plans to gather state attorneys general this month to examine what the Justice Department called the intentional 'stifling' of voices on social media. The department announced the plan as Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey were wrapping up testimony Wednesday morning on efforts to deter foreign trolls and bots ahead of this year's midterm contests. Mr. Dorsey later appeared alone in front of the House Commerce Committee, where he faced a barrage of questions about alleged anticonservative bias over how Twitter enforces its rules. At both hearings, lawmakers quizzed tech executives about how their sites work, what they are doing to bolster their defenses against foreign disruption and what regulation the companies might consider. The questions sharpened the focus on the chasm between current U.S. regulations of global internet companies and the far-reaching capabilities the platforms boast in shaping American news diets and overall discourse.  At multiple points, Mr. Dorsey described Twitter's practice of waiting for users to flag issues before acting as a shortcoming. He said his company was working on algorithms to police abuse, which the company hadn't previously disclosed proactively. There was no representative of [47]Alphabet[48] Inc.'s Google at Wednesday's Senate hearing. The company had been invited, but declined when the committee said its proposed representative wasn't sufficiently senior in rank. An empty chair next to Facebook's Ms. Sandberg and Twitter's Mr. Dorsey was adorned with a placard that simply said 'Google.' Technology stocks tumbled across the board Wednesday as Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey testified, a selloff that hit not just social-media titans but also chip makers, software developers and online streaming services. Facebook fell 2.3% while Twitter sank 6.1%[49], and Google lost about 1%. The day's actions produced a split-screen effect: As most Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee zeroed in on whether the U.S. midterms are sufficiently safeguarded against Russian interference, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress doubled down on longstanding complaints that the platforms are allegedly biased against supporters of President Trump More[50] Big Tech in the Dock[51]: The companies are tempting government intervention It never ceases to amaze methat the same kinds of people who once defended pornography as protected free speech[52]as well as the same companies that make billions of dollars as the platforms for porn[53]have deemed Alex Jones to be unsuitable for the public Dave Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Twitter[54] and Facebook[55] executives were grilled on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid the growing debate over political bias in social media and search. The tech giants say they don't intentionally suppress conservatives, and perhaps that's true. But their nonchalance risks alienating users\u2014and government intervention. Complaints about anti-conservative bias by tech platforms have been growing for some time. While the evidence is mostly anecdotal, the seemingly synchronized and vaguely justified decisions by Apple[56] , Facebook and Google to ban right-wing fabulist Alex Jones's Infowars in August for 'hate speech' raised more doubts about their purported neutrality. President Trump belly-flopped in as usual on Twitter. 'They have it RIGGED,' he tweeted last week. 'Google ...hers are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can ...nnot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!' Mr. Trump warned later at the White House that tech companies are 'treading on very, very troubling territory' and had 'better be careful.'  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow then said the Administration will investigate the tech giants, and on Wednesday The Journal reported the Justice Department will examine whether the social-media giants are 'intentionally stifling' certain viewpoints. Consider conservative radio host Dennis Prager, whose 'PragerU' educational videos on topics such as 'Did Bush Lie About Iraq?' and 'Is America Racist?' have been restricted by Google's YouTube unit. None of the 50 or so censored videos included violent, sexually explicit or hateful content that violated Google's Community Guidelines.  YouTube's algorithms and 'community' of users can flag videos as objectionable, but Google guidelines require an internal review team to remove them. So Google employees ostensibly had to have agreed. PragerU has sued Google and claims in its lawsuit that YouTube 'declined to provide any explanation for why the videos were restricted or demonetized because they purportedly 'can't share more details about our review process, as doing so could benefit channels that do not play by the rules (those who game the system).'' Conservative Doug Wead recently complained on The Federalist website that Google barred him from buying an ad to promote a Fox Business interview. He says a Google employee told him the crawler along the bottom of the video, which quoted Mr. Trump calling the Mueller investigation a 'witch hunt,' was hate speech. Google has a serious problem if its employees can't distinguish news and opinion from hate speech. Infowars may have deserved to be banned, but the ill-defined justifications offered by the tech companies have unsettled even many conservatives who disdain Mr. Jones but worry that they could be next. This has allowed Mr. Jones to pose as a free-speech martyr, which he isn't More[57] Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist???Watch his interaction with Rubio Jones is absolutely right Sen. Marco Rubio and Alex Jones Clash Outside Senate Hearing[58]: Far-right talk show host Alex Jones clashes with Sen. Marco Rubio outside the Senate Intelligence Committee.  CNN Boosts Left-Wing Campaign to Censor Breitbart; Approves 'Blacklisting'[59] Joel B. Pollack Breitbart News 3 Sep 2018  CNN swept aside journalistic ethics on Sunday by endorsing a blacklisting campaign with a glowing interview of Matt Rivitz, the founder of Sleeping Giants, a failed effort to censor Breitbart News by harassing and intimidating companies whose advertisements may (or may not) have appeared on the website. The interview took place onReliableSources, a Sunday morning show that once focused on analyzing the media, but which in recent years has been turned into the editorial mouthpiece of CNN president Jeff Zucker, voiced through host Brian Stelter. Sunday's program was helmed by substitute anchor John Avlon, in for Stelter \u2014 who had earlier used his vacation to dodge[60] questions about CNN's failure to retract[61] a false story about President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Ironically, Avlon andReliable Sources addressed the Cohen story without acknowledging that CNN had lied[62] about the fact that Lanny Davis had been one of its sources. Avlon's panel slammed Davis for 'backtracking' on his version of events, then quickly shifted to talking about threats made against theBoston Globe. Nor did CNN mention the fact that last week, a Mexican cartel boss was arrested two days after putting[63] a $100,000 hit on a Breitbart News reporter \u2014 a story that, had it happened to a CNN reporter, would no doubt have been the lead, not just on CNN, but on every mainstream media outlet in the country The video and more[64] Cory Booker and Democratic Norms[65]: The Senator's political stunt to release documents backfires. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Democrats have been acting out at Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, but Cory Booker is distinguishing himself in a crowded field. The New Jersey Senator released confidential documents in what he admitted was a violation of Senate rules, and his distortions need correcting. Questioning Judge Kavanaugh on Wednesday evening, Mr. Booker referred to an email the judge sent while in George W. Bush's White House counsel's office The papers are shielded from the public under the Presidential Records Act, but Mr. Bush has allowed Senators and staff to read them.  Mr. Booker complained that an email with the subject line 'racial profiling' shouldn't have been withheld. 'This wasn't personal information. There's no national security issue whatsoever,' he intoned. 'The fact that we're not allowing these emails out, as we have asked, as I have asked,' is evidence that 'the system is rigged.' On Thursday Mr. Booker released the documents to TV fanfare and dared Republicans to punish him for it. Hold up. Weeks ago Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley invited Senators to earmark confidential documents they'd like to discuss in open hearings, so the Chairman could try to have restrictions waived. Only Senator Amy Klobuchar responded, and the four documents totaling 12 pages she requested were released late last month. Enter Mr. Booker, stage left, releasing the documents and praising himself for an act of 'civil disobedience.' The documents he referred to were already public on Thursday morning when Senator Booker was still heralding his own high moral character. A spokesman for Senate Judiciary says the committee worked overnight with the Justice Department and Mr. Bush's representatives to honor a release request Mr. Booker made late Wednesday evening. The documents were cleared for the public, and the committee says it notified Senator Booker. Fresh off this embarrassment on Thursday afternoon Senator Booker tweeted out more confidential documents, ostensibly to show his commitment to rule breaking. What salacious information appears in the documents? One email thread discusses the legal merits of racial profiling after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Judge Kavanaugh says he 'generally' favors 'effective security measures that are race-neutral.' Now there's a scoop None of this offers new insight about Judge Kavanaugh, but it does tell us something about Senator Booker's presidential ambitions and the degree to which Democrats are willing to demean the Senate to defeat a nominee. You might even say they're abusing 'democratic norms.' More[66] Dianne, Get Your Gun[67]: Kavanaugh is criticized for following the Heller precedent too well. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Senate Democrats claim to fear that Brett Kavanaugh will be too willing to overturn Supreme Court precedents, but it turns out that not all precedents are created equal. They're also complaining that Judge Kavanaugh might fail to overturn at least one precedent\u2014the landmark 2008 Heller decision upholding an individual's right to bear arms. Gun control is a favorite issue of California Senator Dianne Feinstein, who challenged Judge Kavanaugh at Wednesday's confirmation hearing for following the Supreme Court's Heller precedent too literally for her political tastes. The 2008 Supreme Court ruling struck down a Washington, D.C., ban on handguns. The district then banned so-called assault weapons including semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15. In D.C. v. Heller (2011), Judge Kavanaugh dissented from his appellate-court colleagues by arguing that the rifle ban is unconstitutional. Judge Kavanaugh's reasoning followed Antonin Scalia's originalist logic in Heller that the Second Amendment applies to guns in 'common use.' His colleagues applied a 'balancing' test that allowed them to carve a giant hole in Heller and uphold a rifle ban. 'There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,' Judge Kavanaugh wrote in his circuit-court dissent. 'Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses. Moreover, semi-automatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are.' This upsets Ms. Feinstein, who wants to ban semi-automatic rifles, and so she asked Judge Kavanaugh 'what evidence or study did you use' to determine that assault weapons were in 'common use'? Mr. Kavanaugh replied: 'Semiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. There are millions and millions and millions of semiautomatic rifles that are possessed, so that seemed to fit common use.'  Americans across the country use semi-automatic rifles for hunting and self-defense\u2014so many that Dick's Sporting Goods reported weaker revenue last quarter after stopping sales of assault-style weapons. But according to Ms. Feinstein, the fact that large numbers of Americans buy and use these weapons doesn't mean they are in common use. 'Common use is an activity,' she said. 'It is not common storage or possession. It is use. So what you said was that these weapons are commonly used. They are not.' In colonial times long guns and rifles were commonly kept and carried to be used to defend against tyrannical government and billigerents. By Ms. Feinstein's Second Amendment interpretation, nearly any gun could be banned since they spend more time in storage than 'use.' Judge Kavanaugh said he'd faithfully apply Scalia's Heller opinion, which allowed that some gun regulation may be permissible\u2014for instance, he said, 'dangerous and unusual weapons could be prohibited.' But states have been trying to undercut Heller left and right. New Jersey requires that individuals who wish to carry a handgun for self-defense prove to the state that they have a 'justifiable need'\u2014which has become a nearly impossible standard to meet More[68] Kavanaugh Hearing: Not for Children, but Hottest Ticket in Town[69] Protesters, procedures and presidential ambitions combine for hours of entertainment Dick Durbin is a flat out liarHe knows exactly who organized the protests  It was Chuck Schumer[70], and Durbin was on the phone for the conference call Dave Byron Tau The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  WASHINGTON\u2014In three long days of Senate hearings for President Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court, there were more than 100 arrests of protesters, plenty of procedural maneuvering and a vow by Democrats to commit a willful violation of Senate rules over confidential documents that turned out to be public anyway. Somewhere in the middle of it all was Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee. 'People wonder, are these hearings turning into a circus? I want to defend circuses,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a 15-year veteran of the Senate and a member of the Judiciary Committee. 'Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people.' Perhaps he was thinking about the steady stream of vitriol, as when a woman screamed at Judge Kavanaugh, 'You have blood on your hands; you're a murderer,' before she was removed Thursday from the hearing room by Capitol Police. The disruptions weren't limited to the protesters. On Tuesday, Democratic senators repeatedly attempted to delay the start of the hearings. On Wednesday, they invoked a rarely used procedural maneuver that forced Republicans to adjourn the entire Senate early to continue the hearing. On Thursday, the panel once again engaged in a long debate about documents, as Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said he was planning to release what he called confidential documents, thereby 'knowingly violating the rules.' Other Democratic senators joined in Although recent confirmation hearings for all manner of positions have often prompted political disagreement and sporadic protests, few members of the Senate Judiciary Committee could remember such a sour mood. 'I haven't been in as many confirmation hearings as some of my colleagues, but this is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) on Tuesday. Democrats had sparked an hourlong argument over access to documents, numerous protests had broke out and the panel's chairman had struggled to regain order and keep the hearing on track. In response, Sen. Dick Durbin (D, Ill.), said,. 'I don't know who organized these protests or why they did it, but thank goodness in the United States of America where we venerate free speech, these things can happen.'' More[71] Senate Democratic Infowars[72]: The questioning of Brett Kavanaugh was often as factual as Alex Jones. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Liberals understandably revile right-wing demagogue Alex Jones for fanning conspiracy theories, and on Thursday Twitter[73] permanently banned the Infowars founder. But that doesn't absolve Senate Democrats from indulging their own version of Infowars this week against Brett Kavanaugh.  \u2022 Start with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy's accusation that the judge conspired with Republican Senate staffer Manny Miranda in 2002 to 'hack' Democratic Senators' emails to 'assist in getting President Bush's most controversial judicial nominees confirmed.' That's a weighty charge. So what's Sen. Leahy's evidence? \u2022 Then there was Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono's intimation that Judge Kavanaugh must have known about Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski's sexual musings with female clerks\u2014because how could he not? \u2022 California Sen. Kamala Harris charged that Judge Kavanaugh had communicated with someone at President Trump's personal law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres about the Robert Mueller investigation. 'I have good reason to believe there was a conversation,' Ms. Harris declared, adding that 'I received reliable information.'  North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis asked Ms. Harris to share any 'specific piece of information,' but she demurred. The judge replied on Wednesday that he couldn't recall a conversation, though 'I'm not sure if I know everyone who works at that law firm.' But on Thursday the judge unequivocally denied discussing the Mueller probe with anyone at the law firm \u2022 Then there's the Democratic conceit that President Trump appointed Judge Kavanaugh as legal protection. 'You were gonna basically, like I said, be the human torpedo to take out anything that Mueller brings to the Supreme Court,' Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse declared More[74] Senators Urge Justice Department to Probe Giuliani's Foreign Work[75]  Democrats ask whether President Trump's lawyer should have registered as a foreign agent Democrats don't want blind justice Instead they want to give American justice a black eye It is obvious that the only reason these senators are urging an investigation of Giulianiis that he works for Trump In today's environment, any association with Trump marks a personfor a search-and-destroy witch huntand a lethal dose of the politics of personal destruction Our system of justice was intended to apply equally to alland not simply be a weapon to aim at political enemies Dave Julie Bykowicz The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Seven Senate Democrats are asking the Justice Department to review whether President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The senators allege in a letter dated Wednesday that recent news reports suggest Mr. Giuliani has 'conducted a number of political and public relations activities on behalf of foreign entities' that would seem to require him to register as a foreign agent. Mr. Giuliani has served since April as Mr. Trump's attorney[76] in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump's campaign and associates conspired with them. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion. Russia has denied interfering in the election, even as U.S. intelligence and legal authorities have concluded otherwise[77]. Mr. Giuliani has been employed as a lawyer and strategic adviser since leaving his post as New York City mayor in late December 2001. He has never filed any FARA paperwork, according to the Justice Department's database, saying in the past that his activities don't trigger that requirement because he isn't aiming to influence U.S. policy. The senators cited in their letter recent paid work that Mr. Giuliani did on behalf of the Freeh Group International Solutions, led by former FBI director Louis Freeh. At the firm's request, Mr. Giuliani wrote to the president of Romania last month to criticize the country's anticorruption investigations, taking a position that counters that of the U.S. State Department. Mr. Freeh was retained in July 2016 to review Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu's conviction on corruption charges, Mr. Freeh said in an August 2017 statement. Mr. Freeh said he believes Mr. Popoviciu was wrongly convicted. The Freeh group didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Giuliani has said he was working for a U.S. firm and wasn't trying to influence U.S. policy, the triggers for disclosure. He said Thursday he 'did nothing to invoke FARA either now or ever' and 'never represented foreign interests with [the] U.S. government.' He called the senators' inquiry 'kind of useless' and said they can 'knock themselves out' because they won't find anything illegal or inappropriate.  The letter is signed by Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Dick Durbin of Illinois. The senators reference other work by Mr. Giuliani, including on behalf of the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, and his advocacy for a regime change in Iran More[78] Obama Accuses Trump of 'Capitalizing on Resentment'[79]: Former president urges Americans to engage in midterm elections This is unprecedentedEx-presidents never used to talk like this about their successor Obama tries to act as if he is not breaking precedentby saying that he is speaking as a private citizen, not an ex-president What a liar If he wasn't an ex-president, his message would carry no weight Even worse, Obama is also lying when he claims credit for Trump's great economyObama's economic recovery was anemic throughout his termIt never produced results like this[80], no matter what Obama claims Dave Janet Hook The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Former President Barack Obama Friday accused President Trump of 'capitalizing on resentment' and called on voters to engage in the midterm elections, which he said are 'more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.' 'Just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire,' Mr. Obama said in a speech at the University of Illinois. 'This is not normal.' Mr. Obama bridled at efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to claim credit for the improving economy[81], saying it was a process begun under his presidency. 'When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,' he said. 'Suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle. I have to remind them those job numbers are the same numbers as 2015 and 2016.' Until now, Mr. Obama had withheld open criticism of Mr. Trump, keeping to a tradition of former presidents refraining from attacking their successors. In his address, he said he was stepping out 'as a fellow citizen, not an ex-president' with a call to action. 'I am here to deliver a simple message: You need to vote because our democracy depends on it,' he said More[82] At this point, if Trump sneezed he'd be accused of committing an impeachable offense by the Dems Toobin: Trump's Tweet Blasting Sessions 'May Be an Impeachable Offense'[83].

Donald Trump to Supporters: If You Don't Vote, I Might Get Impeached[84] Your vote this November is more important than ever Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 6 Sep 2018  President Donald Trump warned supporters that Democrats would try to impeach him if they took back the congressional majority. 'They like to use the impeach word,' Trump said, referring to Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters. The president commented on the threat during a rally in Billings, Montana, on Thursday. Trump appeared surprised by the notion of impeachment, adding that 'haters' in the Democrat party did not care about the good he was doing for the country. 'How do you impeach somebody that is doing a great job?' he asked, pointing to the strength of the economy. Trump explained that impeachment would be a bad precedent for Democrats to set, particularly if a Republican majority House felt the need to retaliate against a future Democratic president More[85] Ex-Trump Campaign Adviser George Papadopoulos Sentenced to 14 Days In Prison[86]: He pleaded guilty to lying to FBI about contacts with Russian intermediary This light sentence is Papdopoulos's rewardfor saying incriminating things[87] about President Trump Dave Aruna Viswanatha The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Ex-Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was sentenced Friday to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts [88]with a Russian intermediary, giving special counsel Robert Mueller a second prison term[89] from his 15-month inquiry.  U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ordered the incarceration, saying that he couldn't avoid imposing prison time given the gravity of the investigation. But he said he was moved by what he viewed as Mr. Papadopoulos's 'genuine remorse.' At a 90-minute court hearing, Mr. Papadopoulos said he had made a 'terrible mistake' and wanted to have a second chance. Mr. Papadopoulos wasn't taken into custody. He will begin serving his sentence at a later date. Earlier Friday, President Trump said aboard Air Force One that he doesn't know Mr. Papadopoulos. 'I saw him sitting in one picture at a table with me that's the only thing I know about him,' the president told reporters. 'They got him on, I guess, a couple of lies.' Later, he issued a tweet in which he contrasted the short sentence with the multimillion-dollar cost of the special counsel probe. 'No Collusion. A great day for America!' he wrote. The sentencing came days before a federal jury is scheduled to convene, in the same Washington federal courthouse, to hear a second criminal case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Mr. Manafort faces charges by Mr. Mueller's prosecutors stemming from lobbying and money-laundering allegations More[90] NBC News Humiliated After Chairman Andy Lack Attacks Ronan Farrow[91] Breitbart News September 4, 2018 NBC News is reeling after chairman Andy Lack's overnight attack on Ronan Farrow blew up in the left-wing network's face. Currently, NBC News is under fire for two reasons. The network had in its hot little hands the biggest scandal in Hollywood history, the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, and let it waltz out the door for no valid reason. NBC News refused to bring in outside investigators (as Fox News did following two sexual harassment scandals) to examine its conduct in this matter or the Matt Lauer scandal.

(@JordyAri) September 4, 2018[98] More[99] Trump, Mrs. Wilson and That 'Senior Official'[100]: An attempt via op-ed effectively to inflict a stroke and a twilight on the 45th president. Lance Morrow The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  It was a little less than a century ago that Woodrow Wilson suffered his disabling stroke. He was on the presidential train on a siding near Wichita, Kan., in the midst of his exhausting cross-country whistle-stop tour. He was trying to sell the League of Nations to the American people over the heads of the U.S. Senate and Henry Cabot Lodge. If Twitter[101] had been available in 1919, Wilson might have skipped the tour, avoided the stress, and escaped the stroke.  As the tragedy played out, Wilson was more or less confined for the rest of his second term to the twilight of his sickroom, protected from visitors except for carefully arranged audiences meant to fool Congress and the public into thinking that all was well, or anyway not so bad. For 16 months, First Lady Edith Wilson, presidential physician Cary Grayson and private secretary Joseph Tumulty in effect exercised the powers of the presidency. It was a strange interlude. The country survived. The election of 1920 proceeded in due course, and\u2014not that it was much improvement\u2014brought forth the brief, corrupt presidency of Warren G. Harding.  Now a 'senior official' in the Trump White House\u2014in league with the New York Times\u2014has attempted, in effect, to inflict a stroke and a twilight upon the 45th president, and to declare publicly what Mrs. Wilson kept private: that the president is disabled (given to 'instability' and 'erratic behavior,' according to the anonymous senior official) and that, in his stead, the sane and steady ones will manage Mr. Trump and govern the world, as if in saintly reminder of George Eliot's lines at the end of Middlemarch: 'that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.' Yond 'senior official' has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much\u2014or perhaps he thinks too little and too smugly. The official and the Times are perhaps conjuring episodes of 'Mission Impossible,' in which the IMF (the Impossible Missions Force) surrounds a target person (the president, in this case) with the illusion of an Oval Office and a Rose Garden and limousines and all of his constitutional powers, while in actuality the office of president is being conducted by a secret Committee of the Wise and Sane and Just, with the advice and consent of the Times editorial board.  The ploy is unconstitutional\u2014a mutiny against the democratic process. But is it necessary nonetheless? If so, how is the great danger (an incompetent or radically unstable president) to be handled? Who makes the call?  Before answering, one should consider a subsidiary puzzle: If it is true that the senior official and his colleagues have quietly set themselves up as the Edith Wilson and Joe Tumulty of the Trump administration, why on earth would they jeopardize the task they had set themselves\u2014to contain Mr. Trump and keep the country from running off the rails\u2014by publishing an article in the New York Times announcing that they had done so? Does he imagine that only fellow members of the 'resistance' read the Times? The article will surely lead to the identification of its author; it could not possibly have any other effect than to further destabilize the White House and further enrage the besieged president. If the senior official truly had the best interests of the country at heart, he would have kept secret what he is doing, not only his identity. Publishing the essay makes the author look like a partisan phony whose purpose is not to advance the interests of the American people but rather to inflame voters against Mr. Trump in advance of the November elections. The timing of the op-ed is more than suspicious, coming at just the moment when the contents of Bob Woodward's book 'Fear' (the title itself is pure propaganda) were fed to world-wide media\u2014filled with anecdotes supporting the senior official's version of a mad and incompetent king.  The moment is enriched by the Kavanaugh hearings, with their background theatrics, which themselves might have been arranged by the IMF people: hysterical screamers, and women dressed up in costumes from 'The Handmaid's Tale.' I suspect that the entire performance\u2014the Woodward book, the unidentified senior official's usurpation by op-ed, the screaming, the Handmaids\u2014will be greeted, out in the still-flourishing regions of common sense, as a gaudy, disgraceful example of jumping the shark  More[102] Palestinians, You Don't Have to Live Like a Refugee[103]: Trump is right to defund Unwra, whose anti-Israel propaganda undermines efforts to make peace. Alex Joffe and Asaf Romirowsky The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Dramatic shifts are rare in American foreign policy. One undeniable example is the Trump administration's decision last week to cease funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the main U.N. agency giving aid to Palestinians. At once a nearly 70-year-old Gordian knot has been cut, but what comes next? From Unrwa's 1949 founding on, each U.S. administration had ignored the agency's central role in prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict. As we pointed out in our 2013 book, 'Religion, Politics and the Origins of Palestine Refugee Relief,' the U.S. has aimed since the early 1950s to stabilize Palestinian society through the delivery of aid, providing more than a quarter of Unrwa's funding. But the effect has been to foster Palestinian dependence on foreign support. As the current administration recognizes, Palestinian elites continue to demand aid even as they fulminate against the U.S. in every way.  The decision to cut Unrwa's funding corresponds with the Trump administration's broader perspective on foreign policy. Like trade policy, the U.N. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, President Trump insists that foreign aid must benefit the U.S. in a more substantial way than merely sustaining stability. Unrwa does not, and has not. It retards the development of Palestinian civil institutions and affirms several of the Palestinians' self-defeating grievances. The so-called right of return for Palestinian refugees, which Unrwa promulgates through its educational and policy organs, bolsters a sense of disenfranchisement among Palestinians throughout the world. Unrwa's definition of 'refugees' to include millions who never set foot in British Mandate-era Palestine runs counter to international law and practice. And in the long run, the agency's assumption of duties that ought to belong to the Palestinian people might slow the emergence of a two-state solution to the standoff with Israel.  The Palestinian Authority must now overcome its shock and rage and recognize reality. Reports that they are betting on Democrats' winning control of Congress in November indicate they are betting on the past. Even if the Democrats win, they will be unlikely to build enough support to sustain funding over the president's veto More[104] Twin Bombings in Afghanistan Hit Shiite Enclave[105]: At least 20 people were killed by the blasts in Kabul, and suspicion fell on Sunni fighters with an ISIS affiliate Craig Nelson, Ehsanullah Amiri and Habib Khan Totakhil The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  KABUL\u2014Two bomb blasts just minutes apart tore through a mainly Shiite Muslim neighborhood in the Afghan capital on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and wounding 60 others and reviving fears of a growing sectarian conflict in a country already racked with violence. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apparently coordinated bombings in western Kabul's Dashte Barchi neighborhood. But suspicion fell immediately on the extremist Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State's local affiliate[106], which has carried out attacks regularly in the enclave, which is dominated by minority Shiites of the ethnic Hazara community. The Taliban, the country's largest and most powerful insurgency, denied involvement in the attacks. It issued the denial in a WhatsApp message. In Wednesday's first attack, a man entered a wrestling club as a match was under way and detonated an explosives vest hidden under his clothes, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said. Minutes later, as police, rescue workers and reporters converged on the street outside the club and pedestrians were beginning to ferry the wounded to nearby hospitals, a second blast erupted. It wasn't immediately known how the second attack was carried out A Health Ministry official said at least 20 people were killed in the attacks. For the Shiites of Dashte Barchi, the blasts were confirmation that there is no place to escape in their neighborhood More[107] Judges rule ICC has jurisdiction over Rohingya deportations[108] To fully appreciate the bias being expressed by the ICCagainst the Buddhists of Myanmar in favor of Muslimsread about the genocide that has been committed against Buddhists[109]in neighboring Bangladesh, which the ICC pays no attention to The coverage of this cross-border conflict is about as fairas a description of World War II that focuses on Hiroshima and Nagasakiwithout mentioning Pearl Harbor Dave Mike Corder Associated Press September 6, 2018 THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Thursday that the court has jurisdiction to investigate widespread allegations that Myanmar forces have driven thousands of Rohingya Muslims from their homes. The decision opens up the possibility of crimes against Rohingya people being prosecuted at the Hague-based court, even though Myanmar is not a member of the court. The court said in a statement that Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda must take the jurisdiction ruling into account 'as she continues with her preliminary examination concerning the crimes allegedly committed against the Rohingya people.' The court said the preliminary probe, which aims to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to launch a full-blown investigation, 'must be concluded within a reasonable time.' Bensouda asked earlier this year for a ruling on jurisdiction, arguing that while the Rohingya were forced from their homes in Myanmar, part of the crime involved them being driven across the border into neighboring Bangladesh, which is a member of the court. There have been widespread reports of atrocities committed against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Last week, investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body said that Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for genocide against Rohingya Muslims, taking the unusual step of identifying by name six of those it says were behind systematic crimes targeting the ethnic minority. The call amounted to some of the strongest language yet from U.N. officials who have denounced alleged human rights violations in Myanmar since a bloody crackdown began last August. The three-member 'fact-finding mission' and their team, working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts from expatriate Rohingya, as well as satellite footage and other information for the report More[110] Sweden's Far Right Rises in a Campaign Defined by Immigration[111]  Consensus on the issue is giving way to polarization ahead of elections in the progressive bastion  Bojan Pancevski The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  STRNGNS, Sweden\u2014With his gelled hair and jovial eloquence, Jimmie Akesson could have been mistaken for a talk-show host as he addressed a crowd recently in this idyllic lakeside town. In fact, Mr. Akesson is the leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in neo-Nazism that is poised to become a leading political force in Sunday's elections. And he credits the rise to the party's stance on crime in Sweden, which is seeing rising rates of rape and of murder involving firearms that he blames on its liberal asylum policy. 'Our questioning of mass migration and how to push back against crime\u2014everybody is talking about that now. That's of course in our favor,' Mr. Akesson said in an interview after his campaign appearance, which featured a big screen that flashed crime statistics and images of burning cars. Nationalists and antiestablishment groups have flourished around Europe since a wave of refugees[112] sparked a crisis across the continent in 2015. But Sweden, one of the world's most affluent and progressive nations, is poised for a particularly dramatic swing from a broad liberal consensus to extreme polarization. Polls put the Sweden Democrats in first or second place, and either outcome could leave center-left and center-right blocs struggling to form a stable government. Sweden's economy is growing, jobs are plentiful and the welfare system leaves no one by the wayside. And overall crime rates, while high by Western European standards, remain low, particularly when compared with the U.S. Yet immigration has become the defining issue in the campaign, in part because many Swedes are rattled by surging violent crime in small urban enclaves populated mostly by people of foreign origin More[113] British Jews Have Reason to Fear Corbyn's Labour Party[114] The opposition leader has called Hamas terrorists 'brothers' and disparaged even domestic 'Zionists.' Dovid Efune The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Lord Jonathan Sacks isn't known to throw around accusations. So when the Commonwealth's former chief rabbi weighed in on Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, people took notice. Rabbi Sacks last week described Mr. Corbyn as 'an anti-Semite' who has 'given support to racists, terrorists and dealers of hate.' He called one Corbyn comment 'the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell's 1968 'Rivers of Blood' speech,' a vicious anti-immigration diatribe. Rabbi Sacks was referring to Mr. Corbyn's 2013 description of British 'Zionists': 'They don't want to study history and ... they don't understand English irony either.' On Sunday Rabbi Sacks doubled down, telling the BBC that the prospect of Mr. Corbyn as prime minister was a 'danger' to British Jewry. In July, 68 leading U.K. rabbis had written an open letter to the Guardian accusing Labour's leadership of ignoring the Jewish community and the 'severe and widespread' anti-Semitism plaguing the party. Shortly after, in an unprecedented move, the country's three leading Jewish newspapers published joint cover stories describing the potential of a Corbyn-led government as an 'existential threat to Jewish life' in Britain But Mr. Corbyn and his acolytes are having none of it\u2014and have engaged in concerted efforts to undermine their critics. A Labour spokesman called Rabbi Sacks's comments 'absurd and offensive.' The party briefly put Ms. Hodge under investigation. Labourites who participated in a March protest over anti-Semitism were accused of attempting to smear the party leader and were threatened with dismissal from the party via a process known as 'deselection.' A letter endorsed by thousands of Corbyn supporters alleged that the gathering was the work of a 'very powerful special interest group.' For his part, Mr. Corbyn claimed in an interview: 'I'm not an anti-Semite in any way, never have been, never will be.' His actions and words tell a very different story. He was long associated\u2014unwittingly, he says, with Holocaust denier Paul Eisen. In 2012 he approved of a mural that grotesquely depicted Jewish bankers, and he did not reverse himself until earlier this year. He was long a member in Facebook[115] groups that featured anti-Jewish conspiracies.  His worst blind spot, though, is his failure to distinguish between criticism of Israeli policies and an irrational and thoroughly bigoted hatred of Israel itself. It's an obsession that has led him to align with those who oppose the idea of Jewish self-determination in the Levant, as well as those who have made their purpose to seek Israel's destruction, and even those who have murdered or championed the murder of Israelis and their supporters. In 2010 Mr. Corbyn hosted an event on Holocaust Memorial Day in which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis. In 2012 he appeared on Iranian television to celebrate the release of Palestinian terrorists by Israel in a painful prisoner exchange with Hamas. He referred to the returning convicts as 'brothers.'

Youssef The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  ISLAMABAD Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the U.S. and Pakistan have still got a long way to go to reset troubled ties after a visit in which he sought Islamabad's help in ending the war in Afghanistan. Relations have soured amid differences over Afghanistan, the presence of militants on Pakistani soil, Washington's burgeoning relationship with India and Pakistan's ever-closer ties with China. The two sides didn't reach any concrete agreements during the five-hour visit to Pakistan's capital on Wednesday, but Mr. Pompeo said there were 'a lot more discussions to be had' as he boarded a flight to India after meeting with Pakistan's new leaders. </p><p>'We need to begin to do things that will actually on the ground deliver outcomes so that we can build confidence and trust. That was the focus,'\u00a0he said. Washington has long accused Pakistan of providing sanctuary to the Afghan Taliban and other jihadist groups, a charge Islamabad denies. However, Washington has recently shifted its focus from fighting the Taliban to wanting to forge a peace deal. Pakistan and new Prime Minister Imran Khan have consistently called for a political settlement with the Taliban that would give the group a share of the government in Afghanistan.  The shape of any peace deal remains unclear. U.S. officials met with Taliban representatives[8] in the Gulf state of Qatar in July, but there is no word on further talks. Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi described Wednesday's talks as positive. He assured the U.S. side of full support in bringing the Taliban into peace negotiations. 'Our future is linked to Afghanistan. The future of our children is linked to Afghanistan,'Mr. Qureshi said. 'My peace and stability is linked to Afghan peace and stability.' But Mr. Qureshi warned that if the U.S. wanted Pakistan to focus on its western border with Afghanistan, it would need to help ease tension on its eastern border with India. India and Pakistan remain in a nuclear-armed standoff, with frequent exchange of gunfire across their disputed border in the Kashmir region. Pakistan also accuses India of using Afghan soil to support terrorists against Pakistan, an allegation New Delhi denies. Islamabad believes that in recent years, Washington has abandoned its decades-old alliance with Islamabad in favor of India. President Trump, setting out his South Asia strategy last year, blamed Pakistan for giving sanctuary to terrorists and extending the war in Afghanistan. At the start of 2018, his administration suspended security aid to Islamabad in an attempt to pressure Pakistan to act against militants. Pakistan says it has taken action against all extremist groups and that no terrorist havens remain in its territory. The U.S. doesn't agree, and the Trump administration has been pointed in saying so More[9] U.S., India Sign Military-Intelligence-Sharing Agreement[10] India needs - and can rely on - the United States much more than IranThere is an opportunity for the U.S. to replace Iran as a source of oil for India Even if we had to subsidize oil to India, this would be a far safer and cheaper wayto defeat Iran than American blood and weapons Dave Rajesh Roy and Nancy A. Youssef The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  NEW DELHI The U.S. and India signed an agreement Thursday to usher in closer military and intelligence cooperation[11] between the world's largest democracies. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met with their Indian counterparts, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Defense Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a high-level meeting aimed at deepening ties between the two countries. The two sides signed an agreement to allow the sharing of encrypted military intelligence. The U.S. required India to sign the so-called Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement if it wants to buy America's most advanced military equipment. 'Our discussions have paved the way for a new era in India-U.S. defense and strategic engagement,' said Ms. Sitharaman. 'The agreement will enable India to access advanced technologies from the U.S. and enhance India's defense preparedness.' The countries have been striving to tighten ties as China has been taking an increasingly muscular stance, broadcasting its economic and military might across Asia. India is now one of the biggest buyers of arms from the U.S. Trade between the two countries has grown in recent years, and U.S. companies including Walmart[12] Inc. and Amazon.com[13] Inc. have invested billions of dollars in the Indian economy. U.S. sanctions against Iran and Russia have put India in a difficult position[14] as it sees both nations as important economic and strategic partners. On Thursday, the two sides also discussed the ramifications of U.S. sanctions against Iran. India says it needs a waiver or more time as it relies on Iran for 10% of its energy supply, mainly in the form of oil imports. The U.S., however, insists the imports from Iran be eliminated by Nov. 4. 'We have told the Indian side consistently, as we have told every nation, that sanctions from Nov. 4 will be enforced.' Mr. Pompeo said at a news conference after the meeting  More[15] Iran Defies U.S. Bid to Curb Its Middle East Influence[16]: Tehran has kept up the flow of arms and financial support to proxy forces even as Washington pressures Iran's economy  Sune Engel Rasmussen in Beirut and Michael R. Gordon in Washington The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Iran is signaling that it will buck U.S. efforts to roll back its military presence in the Middle East, moving to cement foreign alliances and continuing to project power abroad despite sanctions that have helped put intense pressure on its economy[17]. Tehran signed a long-term security pact with Syria[18] in August, and has kept up the flow of arms and financial support to proxy forces around the region, according to U.S. officials and a person close to Lebanon's Hezbollah militia. On Sunday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a meeting with air force commanders that Iran needed to boost its personnel and buy more equipment, though he said a war was unlikely. He didn't elaborate. Iran's defiant stance comes as its currency plummets[19] and foreign investors pull out, largely due to rising tension between Washington and Tehran. In May, President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the 2015 nuclear deal[20], which administration officials indicated was part of a broader effort to curtail Iran's activities in the Middle East, and said he was reimposing sanctions.  'In my judgment, what Iran is doing today is simply a continuation of what they have been doing for a long time, which is to harden themselves, build what alliances they can and prepare for the day' when conflict with the U.S. might erupt, Lt. Gen. Michael Nagata of the National Counterterrorism Center said at a conference Wednesday hosted by the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank More[21] Iraqi Protesters Torch Iranian Consulate[22]: Baghdad's Green Zone, Iran-backed militias were also attacked  President Trump's plan for getting Iran out of Syria and Iraq is working beautifullyBy taking Iran to the brink of financial collapseTrump is causing Iran to lose its ability to project power If Iran can't pay for compliance and suppressionthe wheels come off of its foreign adventures Dave Isabel Coles and Ali Nabhan The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  DUBAI Protesters set fire to the Iranian consulate in Basra on Friday in a show of anger against Tehran's involvement in the country's affairs, capping days of violent unrest that has raised fears of a broader conflict. The torching of the Iranian consulate came hours after three mortar rounds were fired early Friday morning into the heavily fortified Green Zone in Baghdad where the U.S. embassy is located, landing in an empty lot and causing no damage. Hours before on Thursday night, protesters had torched the offices of most political parties in Basra, including powerful Iran-backed paramilitary groups. Protests began last week over poor government services, but they have flared into violent rejections of the entire political class and foreign influence. The U.S. and Iran are vying for leverage as Iraqi politicians reconvene parliament and attempt to form a new government following May elections More[23] Iraq to Investigate Protesters' Deaths as Anger Grows[24]  Five men were killed as hundreds demonstrated in Basra about poor government services  Ghassan Adnan and Ali Nabhan The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  DUBAI Iraq's government opened an investigation into the deaths of five men allegedly killed by security forces, as continuing protests against poor government services underscored the growing public anger[25] against the country's political class. The demonstrations turned deadly when security forces tried to disperse the crowd gathered outside the Basra provincial council building late Tuesday to protest the death of a demonstrator on Monday. The violence comes amid growing public anger against a political class that continues to wrangle over government formation[26] four months after parliamentary elections, while ordinary Iraqis struggle with electricity[27] and water shortages. Mahdi al-Tamimi, the head of the Iraqi human rights commission's Basra office, said security forces were to blame for the deaths and noted they had shot to kill. 'The bullet wounds are all above the waist,' he said. The interior ministry didn't confirm or deny the protesters' deaths at the hands of security forces but rejected the use of live ammunition. 'The matter is being investigated and we ask protesters not to assault public property.' Iraq's health ministry said 67 people were wounded, including 27 members of the security forces, but didn't state how. Iraq already faces a daunting list of challenges after three years of war[28] against Islamic State not least rebuilding devastated areas and preventing the militants who have retreated back underground from regaining traction. Protests in Basra flared in recent days after thousands of people fell ill because the water supply was contaminated, reigniting demonstrations that posed a serious challenge to the government earlier this summer. 'Suddenly things turned violent,' said Ahmed Hadi, who was watching Tuesday's protests from his carpenter's shop near the provincial council building. 'People were throwing water bottles at the security forces and there was gunfire everywhere.' Security forces eventually withdrew from the provincial council building following which, the protesters broke in and torched it, according to Mr. Hadi and local officials More[29] Should Pakistan's attitudes toward blasphemy against Islam apply in the Netherlands?[30]  After protests thousands of miles away, an anti-Islam politician cancels a cartoon contest. The global elites who created a media echo chamber favoring globalismnever bothered to tell us of its dark side The net effect of globalism is that the most oppressive regimes in the worldwill effectively determine the laws that other nations must live by Without borders, what stop the censorship laws of China from migrating to America?What prevents the blasphemy laws of Pakistan from coming here too? This issue has been hammering us for decadesbut it has been concealed by the terms 'political correctness' and 'hate speech'so that the public wouldn't realize its repressive foreign origins Instead of joking about these terms, it is time for us to defend our borders from them This means that we must call out the media 'masters of the universe' on their tacticof selling out American freedoms to gain access to lucrative markets in oppressive nations[31]and make acceptance of American freedoms a condition for moving to the U.S Adherence to Islam fundamentally prohibits free speech[32]and on that basis should be treated as a threat Dave Death Penalty News Friday, September 07, 2018  Should Pakistan's attitudes toward blasphemy against Islam apply in the Netherlands? This is the crux of a recent controversy involving the flamboyant politician Geert Wilders of the anti-Islam Dutch Freedom Party. Last week, citing security concerns, Mr. Wilders canceled a proposed cartoon contest in Holland whose participants were invited to lampoon the prophet Muhammad. The cancellation followed protests in Pakistan as well as a spate of death threats from Pakistani celebrities and religious figures. On Aug. 28, Dutch police in The Hague arrested a 26-year-old Pakistani man who had threatened to attack Mr. Wilders and the Dutch Parliament. The Pakistani government considers the cartoon contest's cancellation a triumph. In a press conference, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry gave his country credit for Mr. Wilders's climb-down. Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi hailed it as 'a great moral victory for the Muslim ummah,' the world-wide community of believers. In reality, the incident marks a setback for Pakistan's new government. By pandering to strident Islamists, Prime Minister Imran Khan deepens fears that his election in July strengthens fundamentalism in the nuclear-armed country. Rather than helping Muslims, Pakistani bullying will likely boost anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe. Mr. Wilders, for instance, has long called for an end to Muslim immigration to his country on the grounds that Islam is not compatible with the West. In Pakistan, so-called blasphemy against Islam carries the death penalty. Sometimes a mere accusation can lead an enraged mob to lynch a supposed offender. Religious minorities, including Christians and members of the beleaguered Ahmadiyya Muslim sect, often bear the brunt of these attacks. Instead of seeking to export this backward sensibility to Holland, Mr. Khan ought to use his bully pulpit to tamp down wild expectations from his people. No reasonable person grudges Pakistanis their right to revere Muhammad. And Mr. Wilders, whose political career has been defined by tasteless attacks on Muslims, is not exactly a sympathetic figure. But this does not give Pakistanis the right to set the boundaries of free speech in Holland More[33] Trump on the Potential for a Government Shutdown: 'If It Happens, It Happens'[34]  Current government funding expires at the end of the month, as president presses for funds for Mexico border wall  Vivian Salama and Kristina Peterson The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  WASHINGTON President Trump on Wednesday wouldn't rule out a government shutdown at month's end, despite a full-court press from congressional leaders to avoid a politically damaging showdown just weeks before November's midterm elections. 'If it happens, it happens,' said Mr. Trump, who is intent on securing more funding for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The government's current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Oct. 1, and congressional GOP leaders have been trying for weeks to persuade Mr. Trump to avoid any legislative drama that could jeopardize their prospects of retaining GOP majorities in both chambers. Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) said he was confident he would not need to direct Mr. Trump away from a government shutdown. 'That's not in anyone's interest, and he knows that,' Mr. Ryan told reporters. But shortly before a meeting with the Republican House and Senate leadership Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump said that 'if it's about border security, I'm willing to do anything' to secure it. 'We have to protect our borders,' he added. GOP aides said after the meeting with Mr. Trump that they remained confident the government wouldn't be closed. Mr. Trump has frequently shifted his position on legislation, including threatening to veto a spending bill which he ultimately signed.  Both chambers have passed a series of their own spending bills for the coming fiscal year, which they hope to negotiate and pass packaged into clusters of several bills at a time. But to avoid a fight over wall funding now, they plan to tackle the Department of Homeland Security's funding later in the year. 'We still want to get funding for the wall, but we think the best time to have that discussion is after the election,' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said on Fox News Wednesday evening. He predicted there was 'zero' chance of a shutdown  More[35] Twitter Permanently Bans Alex Jones After New Violations[36]  Twitter said the right-wing provocateur had violated its 'abusive-behavior policy'  It didn't take long for Dorsey to buckle to liberal peer pressure, did it?That is where the real danger lies Dave Yoree Koh The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Twitter[37] Inc. on Thursday said it permanently banned Alex Jones and his website Infowars, effectively taking away one of the last few online microphones available to the right-wing provocateur. While other tech companies including Apple[38] Inc., Facebook[39] Inc. and Alphabet[40] Inc.'s YouTube previously suspended various accounts associated to Mr. Jones, Twitter had allowed him to remain on its platform. Twitter said Thursday[41] its decision was based on reports of tweets and videos Mr. Jones posted in the past 24 hours 'that violate our abusive-behavior policy, in addition to the accounts' past violations.'  Among his recent posts was one video in which he berated and insulted a CNN reporter. Twitter last month temporarily suspended Mr. Jones for seven days for violating its content policy. Mr. Jones frequently touts discredited conspiracy theories, most notably labeling as a hoax the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School that killed 20 children Tech companies have had a tortured relationship with Mr. Jones, who has repeatedly tested their commitment to free expression on their platforms. The issue came to a head last month when Apple removed links to content from Infowars and eliminated access to five Infowars podcasts, including 'The Alex Jones Show,' from its directory. Next, YouTube eliminated channels related to Infowars and Facebook erased four pages run by Mr. Jones. Following those actions, Mr. Jones has argued that Silicon Valley is suppressing his First Amendment rights and trying to muzzle conservative viewpoints Twitter's move to permanently remove Mr. Jones from the site came a day after its CEO, Jack Dorsey, testified before Congress on election interference and potential political bias against conservatives that impacts how content is shown to users Mr. Dorsey has said the company is trying to improve how it enforces its policies and articulates them to users. The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Mr. Dorsey at times has frustrated some staffers[42] by weighing in at the last minute on enforcement decisions. The firm said he is involved in the decision-making but doesn't overrule the decisions of his team. Mr. Dorsey's involvement in such high-profile decisions wouldn't be unique. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was personally involved in the company's decision last month to suspend Mr. Jones's accounts, according to a person familiar with the matter. Facebook declined to comment on Mr. Zuckerberg's role in the decision.  Last month, Mr. Dorsey defended his firm's decision not to ban Mr. Jones  More[43] Justice Department to Examine Whether Social-Media Giants Are 'Intentionally Stifling' Some Viewpoints[44]  Move announced as Facebook's Sandberg and Twitter's Dorsey defend their platforms Deepa Seetharaman, Dustin Volz and John D. McKinnon The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Even as top executives at Facebook[45] and Twitter[46] attempted to fend off questions from senators about election interference on their platforms, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he plans to gather state attorneys general this month to examine what the Justice Department called the intentional 'stifling' of voices on social media. The department announced the plan as Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter Inc. Chief Executive Jack Dorsey were wrapping up testimony Wednesday morning on efforts to deter foreign trolls and bots ahead of this year's midterm contests. Mr. Dorsey later appeared alone in front of the House Commerce Committee, where he faced a barrage of questions about alleged anticonservative bias over how Twitter enforces its rules. At both hearings, lawmakers quizzed tech executives about how their sites work, what they are doing to bolster their defenses against foreign disruption and what regulation the companies might consider. The questions sharpened the focus on the chasm between current U.S. regulations of global internet companies and the far-reaching capabilities the platforms boast in shaping American news diets and overall discourse.  At multiple points, Mr. Dorsey described Twitter's practice of waiting for users to flag issues before acting as a shortcoming. He said his company was working on algorithms to police abuse, which the company hadn't previously disclosed proactively. There was no representative of [47]Alphabet[48] Inc.'s Google at Wednesday's Senate hearing. The company had been invited, but declined when the committee said its proposed representative wasn't sufficiently senior in rank. An empty chair next to Facebook's Ms. Sandberg and Twitter's Mr. Dorsey was adorned with a placard that simply said 'Google.' Technology stocks tumbled across the board Wednesday as Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Dorsey testified, a selloff that hit not just social-media titans but also chip makers, software developers and online streaming services. Facebook fell 2.3% while Twitter sank 6.1%[49], and Google lost about 1%. The day's actions produced a split-screen effect: As most Republicans and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee zeroed in on whether the U.S. midterms are sufficiently safeguarded against Russian interference, the Trump administration and its allies in Congress doubled down on longstanding complaints that the platforms are allegedly biased against supporters of President Trump More[50] Big Tech in the Dock[51]: The companies are tempting government intervention It never ceases to amaze methat the same kinds of people who once defended pornography as protected free speech[52]as well as the same companies that make billions of dollars as the platforms for porn[53]have deemed Alex Jones to be unsuitable for the public Dave Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Twitter[54] and Facebook[55] executives were grilled on Capitol Hill Wednesday, amid the growing debate over political bias in social media and search. The tech giants say they don't intentionally suppress conservatives, and perhaps that's true. But their nonchalance risks alienating users and government intervention. Complaints about anti-conservative bias by tech platforms have been growing for some time. While the evidence is mostly anecdotal, the seemingly synchronized and vaguely justified decisions by Apple[56] , Facebook and Google to ban right-wing fabulist Alex Jones's Infowars in August for 'hate speech' raised more doubts about their purported neutrality. President Trump belly-flopped in as usual on Twitter. 'They have it RIGGED,' he tweeted last week. 'Google others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!' Mr. Trump warned later at the White House that tech companies are 'treading on very, very troubling territory' and had 'better be careful.'  White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow then said the Administration will investigate the tech giants, and on Wednesday The Journal reported the Justice Department will examine whether the social-media giants are 'intentionally stifling' certain viewpoints. Consider conservative radio host Dennis Prager, whose 'PragerU' educational videos on topics such as 'Did Bush Lie About Iraq?' and 'Is America Racist?' have been restricted by Google's YouTube unit. None of the 50 or so censored videos included violent, sexually explicit or hateful content that violated Google's Community Guidelines.  YouTube's algorithms and 'community' of users can flag videos as objectionable, but Google guidelines require an internal review team to remove them. So Google employees ostensibly had to have agreed. PragerU has sued Google and claims in its lawsuit that YouTube 'declined to provide any explanation for why the videos were restricted or demonetized because they purportedly 'can't share more details about our review process, as doing so could benefit channels that do not play by the rules (those who game the system).'' Conservative Doug Wead recently complained on The Federalist website that Google barred him from buying an ad to promote a Fox Business interview. He says a Google employee told him the crawler along the bottom of the video, which quoted Mr. Trump calling the Mueller investigation a 'witch hunt,' was hate speech. Google has a serious problem if its employees can't distinguish news and opinion from hate speech. Infowars may have deserved to be banned, but the ill-defined justifications offered by the tech companies have unsettled even many conservatives who disdain Mr. Jones but worry that they could be next. This has allowed Mr. Jones to pose as a free-speech martyr, which he isn't More[57] Alex Jones is a conspiracy theorist???Watch his interaction with Rubio Jones is absolutely right Sen. Marco Rubio and Alex Jones Clash Outside Senate Hearing[58]: Far-right talk show host Alex Jones clashes with Sen. Marco Rubio outside the Senate Intelligence Committee.  CNN Boosts Left-Wing Campaign to Censor Breitbart; Approves 'Blacklisting'[59] Joel B. Pollack Breitbart News 3 Sep 2018  CNN swept aside journalistic ethics on Sunday by endorsing a blacklisting campaign with a glowing interview of Matt Rivitz, the founder of Sleeping Giants, a failed effort to censor Breitbart News by harassing and intimidating companies whose advertisements may (or may not) have appeared on the website. The interview took place on\u00a0Reliable\u00a0Sources, a Sunday morning show that once focused on analyzing the media, but which in recent years has been turned into the editorial mouthpiece of CNN president Jeff Zucker, voiced through host Brian Stelter. Sunday's program was helmed by substitute anchor John Avlon, in for Stelter   who had earlier used his vacation to dodge[60] questions about CNN's failure to retract[61] a false story about President Donald Trump's former lawyer, Michael Cohen. Ironically, Avlon and\u00a0Reliable Sources addressed the Cohen story without acknowledging that CNN had lied[62] about the fact that Lanny Davis had been one of its sources. Avlon's panel slammed Davis for 'backtracking' on his version of events, then quickly shifted to talking about threats made against the\u00a0Boston Globe. Nor did CNN mention the fact that last week, a Mexican cartel boss was arrested two days after putting[63] a $100,000 hit on a Breitbart News reporter   a story that, had it happened to a CNN reporter, would no doubt have been the lead, not just on CNN, but on every mainstream media outlet in the country The video and more[64] Cory Booker and Democratic Norms[65]: The Senator's political stunt to release documents backfires. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Democrats have been acting out at Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, but Cory Booker is distinguishing himself in a crowded field. The New Jersey Senator released confidential documents in what he admitted was a violation of Senate rules, and his distortions need correcting. Questioning Judge Kavanaugh on Wednesday evening, Mr. Booker referred to an email the judge sent while in George W. Bush's White House counsel's office The papers are shielded from the public under the Presidential Records Act, but Mr. Bush has allowed Senators and staff to read them.  Mr. Booker complained that an email with the subject line 'racial profiling' shouldn't have been withheld. 'This wasn't personal information. There's no national security issue whatsoever,' he intoned. 'The fact that we're not allowing these emails out, as we have asked, as I have asked,' is evidence that 'the system is rigged.' On Thursday Mr. Booker released the documents to TV fanfare and dared Republicans to punish him for it. Hold up. Weeks ago Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley invited Senators to earmark confidential documents they'd like to discuss in open hearings, so the Chairman could try to have restrictions waived. Only Senator Amy Klobuchar responded, and the four documents totaling 12 pages she requested were released late last month. Enter Mr. Booker, stage left, releasing the documents and praising himself for an act of 'civil disobedience.' The documents he referred to were already public on Thursday morning when Senator Booker was still heralding his own high moral character. A spokesman for Senate Judiciary says the committee worked overnight with the Justice Department and Mr. Bush's representatives to honor a release request Mr. Booker made late Wednesday evening. The documents were cleared for the public, and the committee says it notified Senator Booker. Fresh off this embarrassment on Thursday afternoon Senator Booker tweeted out more confidential documents, ostensibly to show his commitment to rule breaking. What salacious information appears in the documents? One email thread discusses the legal merits of racial profiling after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. Judge Kavanaugh says he 'generally' favors 'effective security measures that are race-neutral.' Now there's a scoop None of this offers new insight about Judge Kavanaugh, but it does tell us something about Senator Booker's presidential ambitions and the degree to which Democrats are willing to demean the Senate to defeat a nominee. You might even say they're abusing 'democratic norms.' More[66] Dianne, Get Your Gun[67]: Kavanaugh is criticized for following the Heller precedent too well. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Senate Democrats claim to fear that Brett Kavanaugh will be too willing to overturn Supreme Court precedents, but it turns out that not all precedents are created equal. They're also complaining that Judge Kavanaugh might fail to overturn at least one precedent the landmark 2008 Heller decision upholding an individual's right to bear arms. Gun control is a favorite issue of California Senator Dianne Feinstein, who challenged Judge Kavanaugh at Wednesday's confirmation hearing for following the Supreme Court's Heller precedent too literally for her political tastes. The 2008 Supreme Court ruling struck down a Washington, D.C., ban on handguns. The district then banned so-called assault weapons including semi-automatic rifles such as the AR-15. In D.C. v. Heller (2011), Judge Kavanaugh dissented from his appellate-court colleagues by arguing that the rifle ban is unconstitutional. Judge Kavanaugh's reasoning followed Antonin Scalia's originalist logic in Heller that the Second Amendment applies to guns in 'common use.' His colleagues applied a 'balancing' test that allowed them to carve a giant hole in Heller and uphold a rifle ban. 'There is no meaningful or persuasive constitutional distinction between semi-automatic handguns and semi-automatic rifles,' Judge Kavanaugh wrote in his circuit-court dissent. 'Semi-automatic rifles, like semi-automatic handguns, have not traditionally been banned and are in common use by law-abiding citizens for self-defense in the home, hunting, and other lawful uses. Moreover, semi-automatic handguns are used in connection with violent crimes far more than semi-automatic rifles are.' This upsets Ms. Feinstein, who wants to ban semi-automatic rifles, and so she asked Judge Kavanaugh 'what evidence or study did you use' to determine that assault weapons were in 'common use'? Mr. Kavanaugh replied: 'Semiautomatic rifles are widely possessed in the United States. There are millions and millions and millions of semiautomatic rifles that are possessed, so that seemed to fit common use.'  Americans across the country use semi-automatic rifles for hunting and self-defense so many that Dick's Sporting Goods reported weaker revenue last quarter after stopping sales of assault-style weapons. But according to Ms. Feinstein, the fact that large numbers of Americans buy and use these weapons doesn't mean they are in common use. 'Common use is an activity,' she said. 'It is not common storage or possession. It is use. So what you said was that these weapons are commonly used. They are not.' In colonial times long guns and rifles were commonly kept and carried to be used to defend against tyrannical government and billigerents. By Ms. Feinstein's Second Amendment interpretation, nearly any gun could be banned since they spend more time in storage than 'use.' Judge Kavanaugh said he'd faithfully apply Scalia's Heller opinion, which allowed that some gun regulation may be permissible for instance, he said, 'dangerous and unusual weapons could be prohibited.' But states have been trying to undercut Heller left and right. New Jersey requires that individuals who wish to carry a handgun for self-defense prove to the state that they have a 'justifiable need' which has become a nearly impossible standard to meet More[68] Kavanaugh Hearing: Not for Children, but Hottest Ticket in Town[69] Protesters, procedures and presidential ambitions combine for hours of entertainment Dick Durbin is a flat out liarHe knows exactly who organized the protests  It was Chuck Schumer[70], and Durbin was on the phone for the conference call Dave Byron Tau The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  WASHINGTON In three long days of Senate hearings for President Trump's nomination to the Supreme Court, there were more than 100 arrests of protesters, plenty of procedural maneuvering and a vow by Democrats to commit a willful violation of Senate rules over confidential documents that turned out to be public anyway. Somewhere in the middle of it all was Brett Kavanaugh, the nominee. 'People wonder, are these hearings turning into a circus? I want to defend circuses,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a 15-year veteran of the Senate and a member of the Judiciary Committee. 'Circuses are entertaining, and you can take your children to them. This hearing is neither entertaining nor appropriate for young people.' Perhaps he was thinking about the steady stream of vitriol, as when a woman screamed at Judge Kavanaugh, 'You have blood on your hands; you're a murderer,' before she was removed Thursday from the hearing room by Capitol Police. The disruptions weren't limited to the protesters. On Tuesday, Democratic senators repeatedly attempted to delay the start of the hearings. On Wednesday, they invoked a rarely used procedural maneuver that forced Republicans to adjourn the entire Senate early to continue the hearing. On Thursday, the panel once again engaged in a long debate about documents, as Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) said he was planning to release what he called confidential documents, thereby 'knowingly violating the rules.' Other Democratic senators joined in Although recent confirmation hearings for all manner of positions have often prompted political disagreement and sporadic protests, few members of the Senate Judiciary Committee could remember such a sour mood. 'I haven't been in as many confirmation hearings as some of my colleagues, but this is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) on Tuesday. Democrats had sparked an hourlong argument over access to documents, numerous protests had broke out and the panel's chairman had struggled to regain order and keep the hearing on track. In response, Sen. Dick Durbin (D, Ill.), said,. 'I don't know who organized these protests or why they did it, but thank goodness in the United States of America where we venerate free speech, these things can happen.'' More[71] Senate Democratic Infowars[72]: The questioning of Brett Kavanaugh was often as factual as Alex Jones. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Liberals understandably revile right-wing demagogue Alex Jones for fanning conspiracy theories, and on Thursday Twitter[73] permanently banned the Infowars founder. But that doesn't absolve Senate Democrats from indulging their own version of Infowars this week against Brett Kavanaugh.    Start with Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy's accusation that the judge conspired with Republican Senate staffer Manny Miranda in 2002 to 'hack' Democratic Senators' emails to 'assist in getting President Bush's most controversial judicial nominees confirmed.' That's a weighty charge. So what's Sen. Leahy's evidence?   Then there was Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono's intimation that Judge Kavanaugh must have known about Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Alex Kozinski's sexual musings with female clerks because how could he not?   California Sen. Kamala Harris charged that Judge Kavanaugh had communicated with someone at President Trump's personal law firm Kasowitz Benson Torres about the Robert Mueller investigation. 'I have good reason to believe there was a conversation,' Ms. Harris declared, adding that 'I received reliable information.'  North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis asked Ms. Harris to share any 'specific piece of information,' but she demurred. The judge replied on Wednesday that he couldn't recall a conversation, though 'I'm not sure if I know everyone who works at that law firm.' But on Thursday the judge unequivocally denied discussing the Mueller probe with anyone at the law firm   Then there's the Democratic conceit that President Trump appointed Judge Kavanaugh as legal protection. 'You were gonna basically, like I said, be the human torpedo to take out anything that Mueller brings to the Supreme Court,' Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse declared More[74] Senators Urge Justice Department to Probe Giuliani's Foreign Work[75]  Democrats ask whether President Trump's lawyer should have registered as a foreign agent Democrats don't want blind justice Instead they want to give American justice a black eye It is obvious that the only reason these senators are urging an investigation of Giulianiis that he works for Trump In today's environment, any association with Trump marks a personfor a search-and-destroy witch huntand a lethal dose of the politics of personal destruction Our system of justice was intended to apply equally to alland not simply be a weapon to aim at political enemies Dave Julie Bykowicz The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Seven Senate Democrats are asking the Justice Department to review whether President Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani has complied with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The senators allege in a letter dated Wednesday that recent news reports suggest Mr. Giuliani has 'conducted a number of political and public relations activities on behalf of foreign entities' that would seem to require him to register as a foreign agent. Mr. Giuliani has served since April as Mr. Trump's attorney[76] in special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether Russian operatives interfered in the 2016 presidential election and whether Mr. Trump's campaign and associates conspired with them. Mr. Trump has denied any collusion. Russia has denied interfering in the election, even as U.S. intelligence and legal authorities have concluded otherwise[77]. Mr. Giuliani has been employed as a lawyer and strategic adviser since leaving his post as New York City mayor in late December 2001. He has never filed any FARA paperwork, according to the Justice Department's database, saying in the past that his activities don't trigger that requirement because he isn't aiming to influence U.S. policy. The senators cited in their letter recent paid work that Mr. Giuliani did on behalf of the Freeh Group International Solutions, led by former FBI director Louis Freeh. At the firm's request, Mr. Giuliani wrote to the president of Romania last month to criticize the country's anticorruption investigations, taking a position that counters that of the U.S. State Department. Mr. Freeh was retained in July 2016 to review Romanian businessman Gabriel Popoviciu's conviction on corruption charges, Mr. Freeh said in an August 2017 statement. Mr. Freeh said he believes Mr. Popoviciu was wrongly convicted. The Freeh group didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Giuliani has said he was working for a U.S. firm and wasn't trying to influence U.S. policy, the triggers for disclosure. He said Thursday he 'did nothing to invoke FARA either now or ever' and 'never represented foreign interests with [the] U.S. government.' He called the senators' inquiry 'kind of useless' and said they can 'knock themselves out' because they won't find anything illegal or inappropriate.  The letter is signed by Sens. Tom Udall of New Mexico, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Jeff Merkley of Oregonand Dick Durbin of Illinois. The senators reference other work by Mr. Giuliani, including on behalf of the city of Kharkiv, Ukraine, and his advocacy for a regime change in Iran More[78] Obama Accuses Trump of 'Capitalizing on Resentment'[79]: Former president urges Americans to engage in midterm elections This is unprecedentedEx-presidents never used to talk like this about their successor Obama tries to act as if he is not breaking precedentby saying that he is speaking as a private citizen, not an ex-president What a liar If he wasn't an ex-president, his message would carry no weight Even worse, Obama is also lying when he claims credit for Trump's great economyObama's economic recovery was anemic throughout his termIt never produced results like this[80], no matter what Obama claims Dave Janet Hook The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Former President Barack Obama Friday accused President Trump of 'capitalizing on resentment' and called on voters to engage in the midterm elections, which he said are 'more important than any I can remember in my lifetime.' 'Just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire,' Mr. Obama said in a speech at the University of Illinois. 'This is not normal.' Mr. Obama bridled at efforts by Mr. Trump and his allies to claim credit for the improving economy[81], saying it was a process begun under his presidency. 'When you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let's just remember when this recovery started,' he said. 'Suddenly Republicans are saying it's a miracle. I have to remind them those job numbers are the same numbers as 2015 and 2016.' Until now, Mr. Obama had withheld open criticism of Mr. Trump, keeping to a tradition of former presidents refraining from attacking their successors. In his address, he said he was stepping out 'as a fellow citizen, not an ex-president' with a call to action. 'I am here to deliver a simple message: You need to vote because our democracy depends on it,' he said More[82] At this point, if Trump sneezed he'd be accused of committing an impeachable offense by the Dems Toobin: Trump's Tweet Blasting Sessions 'May Be an Impeachable Offense'[83].

Donald Trump to Supporters: If You Don't Vote, I Might Get Impeached[84] Your vote this November is more important than ever Dave Charlie Spiering Breitbart News 6 Sep 2018  President Donald Trump warned supporters that Democrats would try to impeach him if they took back the congressional majority. 'They like to use the impeach word,' Trump said, referring to Democrats like Rep. Maxine Waters. The president commented on the threat during a rally in Billings, Montana, on Thursday. Trump appeared surprised by the notion of impeachment, adding that 'haters' in the Democrat party did not care about the good he was doing for the country. 'How do you impeach somebody that is doing a great job?' he asked, pointing to the strength of the economy. Trump explained that impeachment would be a bad precedent for Democrats to set, particularly if a Republican majority House felt the need to retaliate against a future Democratic president More[85] Ex-Trump Campaign Adviser George Papadopoulos Sentenced to 14 Days In Prison[86]: He pleaded guilty to lying to FBI about contacts with Russian intermediary This light sentence is Papdopoulos's rewardfor saying incriminating things[87] about President Trump Dave Aruna Viswanatha The Wall Street Journal Sept. 7, 2018  Ex-Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos was sentenced Friday to 14 days in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts [88]with a Russian intermediary, giving special counsel Robert Mueller a second prison term[89] from his 15-month inquiry.  U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ordered the incarceration, saying that he couldn't avoid imposing prison time given the gravity of the investigation. But he said he was moved by what he viewed as Mr. Papadopoulos's 'genuine remorse.' At a 90-minute court hearing, Mr. Papadopoulos said he had made a 'terrible mistake' and wanted to have a second chance. Mr. Papadopoulos wasn't taken into custody. He will begin serving his sentence at a later date. Earlier Friday, President Trump said aboard Air Force One that he doesn't know Mr. Papadopoulos. 'I saw him sitting in one picture at a table with me that's the only thing I know about him,' the president told reporters. 'They got him on, I guess, a couple of lies.' Later, he issued a tweet in which he contrasted the short sentence with the multimillion-dollar cost of the special counsel probe. 'No Collusion. A great day for America!' he wrote. The sentencing came days before a federal jury is scheduled to convene, in the same Washington federal courthouse, to hear a second criminal case against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Mr. Manafort faces charges by Mr. Mueller's prosecutors stemming from lobbying and money-laundering allegations More[90] NBC News Humiliated After Chairman Andy Lack Attacks Ronan Farrow[91] Breitbart News September 4, 2018 NBC News is reeling after chairman Andy Lack's overnight attack on Ronan Farrow blew up in the left-wing network's face. Currently, NBC News is under fire for two reasons. The network had in its hot little hands the biggest scandal in Hollywood history, the Harvey Weinstein sex abuse scandal, and let it waltz out the door for no valid reason. NBC News refused to bring in outside investigators (as Fox News did following two sexual harassment scandals) to examine its conduct in this matter or the Matt Lauer scandal.

(@JordyAri) September 4, 2018[98] More[99] Trump, Mrs. Wilson and That 'Senior Official'[100]: An attempt via op-ed effectively to inflict a stroke and a twilight on the 45th president. Lance Morrow The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  It was a little less than a century ago that Woodrow Wilson suffered his disabling stroke. He was on the presidential train on a siding near Wichita, Kan., in the midst of his exhausting cross-country whistle-stop tour. He was trying to sell the League of Nations to the American people over the heads of the U.S. Senate and Henry Cabot Lodge. If Twitter[101] had been available in 1919, Wilson might have skipped the tour, avoided the stress, and escaped the stroke.  As the tragedy played out, Wilson was more or less confined for the rest of his second term to the twilight of his sickroom, protected from visitors except for carefully arranged audiences meant to fool Congress and the public into thinking that all was well, or anyway not so bad. For 16 months, First Lady Edith Wilson, presidential physician Cary Grayson and private secretary Joseph Tumulty in effect exercised the powers of the presidency. It was a strange interlude. The country survived. The election of 1920 proceeded in due course, and not that it was much improvement brought forth the brief, corrupt presidency of Warren G. Harding.  Now a 'senior official' in the Trump White House in league with the New York Times has attempted, in effect, to inflict a stroke and a twilight upon the 45th president, and to declare publicly what Mrs. Wilson kept private: that the president is disabled (given to 'instability' and 'erratic behavior,' according to the anonymous senior official) and that, in his stead, the sane and steady ones will manage Mr. Trump and govern the world, as if in saintly reminder of George Eliot's lines at the end of Middlemarch: 'that things are not so ill with you and me as they might have been, is half owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life, and rest in unvisited tombs.' Yond 'senior official' has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much or perhaps he thinks too little and too smugly. The official and the Times are perhaps conjuring episodes of 'Mission Impossible,' in which the IMF (the Impossible Missions Force) surrounds a target person (the president, in this case) with the illusion of an Oval Office and a Rose Garden and limousines and all of his constitutional powers, while in actuality the office of president is being conducted by a secret Committee of the Wise and Sane and Just, with the advice and consent of the Times editorial board.  The ploy is unconstitutional a mutiny against the democratic process. But is it necessary nonetheless? If so, how is the great danger (an incompetent or radically unstable president) to be handled? Who makes the call?  Before answering, one should consider a subsidiary puzzle: If it is true that the senior official and his colleagues have quietly set themselves up as the Edith Wilson and Joe Tumulty of the Trump administration, why on earth would they jeopardize the task they had set themselves to contain Mr. Trump and keep the country from running off the rails by publishing an article in the New York Times announcing that they had done so? Does he imagine that only fellow members of the 'resistance' read the Times? The article will surely lead to the identification of its author; it could not possibly have any other effect than to further destabilize the White House and further enrage the besieged president. If the senior official truly had the best interests of the country at heart, he would have kept secret what he is doing, not only his identity. Publishing the essay makes the author look like a partisan phony whose purpose is not to advance the interests of the American people but rather to inflame voters against Mr. Trump in advance of the November elections. The timing of the op-ed is more than suspicious, coming at just the moment when the contents of Bob Woodward's book 'Fear' (the title itself is pure propaganda) were fed to world-wide media filled with anecdotes supporting the senior official's version of a mad and incompetent king.  The moment is enriched by the Kavanaugh hearings, with their background theatrics, which themselves might have been arranged by the IMF people: hysterical screamers, and women dressed up in costumes from 'The Handmaid's Tale.' I suspect that the entire performance the Woodward book, the unidentified senior official's usurpation by op-ed, the screaming, the Handmaids will be greeted, out in the still-flourishing regions of common sense, as a gaudy, disgraceful example of jumping the shark  More[102] Palestinians, You Don't Have to Live Like a Refugee[103]: Trump is right to defund Unwra, whose anti-Israel propaganda undermines efforts to make peace. Alex Joffe and Asaf Romirowsky The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  Dramatic shifts are rare in American foreign policy. One undeniable example is the Trump administration's decision last week to cease funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, the main U.N. agency giving aid to Palestinians. At once a nearly 70-year-old Gordian knot has been cut, but what comes next? From Unrwa's 1949 founding on, each U.S. administration had ignored the agency's central role in prolonging the Arab-Israeli conflict. As we pointed out in our 2013 book, 'Religion, Politics and the Origins of Palestine Refugee Relief,' the U.S. has aimed since the early 1950s to stabilize Palestinian society through the delivery of aid, providing more than a quarter of Unrwa's funding. But the effect has been to foster Palestinian dependence on foreign support. As the current administration recognizes, Palestinian elites continue to demand aid even as they fulminate against the U.S. in every way.  The decision to cut Unrwa's funding corresponds with the Trump administration's broader perspective on foreign policy. Like trade policy, the U.N. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, President Trump insists that foreign aid must benefit the U.S. in a more substantial way than merely sustaining stability. Unrwa does not, and has not. It retards the development of Palestinian civil institutions and affirms several of the Palestinians' self-defeating grievances. The so-called right of return for Palestinian refugees, which Unrwa promulgates through its educational and policy organs, bolsters a sense of disenfranchisement among Palestinians throughout the world. Unrwa's definition of 'refugees' to include millions who never set foot in British Mandate-era Palestine runs counter to international law and practice. And in the long run, the agency's assumption of duties that ought to belong to the Palestinian people might slow the emergence of a two-state solution to the standoff with Israel.  The Palestinian Authority must now overcome its shock and rage and recognize reality. Reports that they are betting on Democrats' winning control of Congress in November indicate they are betting on the past. Even if the Democrats win, they will be unlikely to build enough support to sustain funding over the president's veto More[104] Twin Bombings in Afghanistan Hit Shiite Enclave[105]: At least 20 people were killed by the blasts in Kabul, and suspicion fell on Sunni fighters with an ISIS affiliate Craig Nelson, Ehsanullah Amiri and Habib Khan Totakhil The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  KABUL Two bomb blasts just minutes apart tore through a mainly Shiite Muslim neighborhood in the Afghan capital on Wednesday, killing at least 20 people and wounding 60 others and reviving fears of a growing sectarian conflict in a country already racked with violence. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the apparently coordinated bombings in western Kabul's Dashte Barchi neighborhood. But suspicion fell immediately on the extremist Sunni Muslim fighters of Islamic State's local affiliate[106], which has carried out attacks regularly in the enclave, which is dominated by minority Shiites of the ethnic Hazara community. The Taliban, the country's largest and most powerful insurgency, denied involvement in the attacks. It issued the denial in a WhatsApp message. In Wednesday's first attack, a man entered a wrestling club as a match was under way and detonated an explosives vest hidden under his clothes, Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said. Minutes later, as police, rescue workers and reporters converged on the street outside the club and pedestrians were beginning to ferry the wounded to nearby hospitals, a second blast erupted. It wasn't immediately known how the second attack was carried out A Health Ministry official said at least 20 people were killed in the attacks. For the Shiites of Dashte Barchi, the blasts were confirmation that there is no place to escape in their neighborhood More[107] Judges rule ICC has jurisdiction over Rohingya deportations[108] To fully appreciate the bias being expressed by the ICCagainst the Buddhists of Myanmar in favor of Muslimsread about the genocide that has been committed against Buddhists[109]in neighboring Bangladesh, which the ICC pays no attention to The coverage of this cross-border conflict is about as fairas a description of World War II that focuses on Hiroshima and Nagasakiwithout mentioning Pearl Harbor Dave Mike Corder Associated Press September 6, 2018 THE HAGUE, Netherlands - Judges at the International Criminal Court ruled Thursday that the court has jurisdiction to investigate widespread allegations that Myanmar forces have driven thousands of Rohingya Muslims from their homes. The decision opens up the possibility of crimes against Rohingya people being prosecuted at the Hague-based court, even though Myanmar is not a member of the court. The court said in a statement that Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda must take the jurisdiction ruling into account 'as she continues with her preliminary examination concerning the crimes allegedly committed against the Rohingya people.' The court said the preliminary probe, which aims to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to launch a full-blown investigation, 'must be concluded within a reasonable time.' Bensouda asked earlier this year for a ruling on jurisdiction, arguing that while the Rohingya were forced from their homes in Myanmar, part of the crime involved them being driven across the border into neighboring Bangladesh, which is a member of the court. There have been widespread reports of atrocities committed against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar. Last week, investigators working for the U.N.'s top human rights body said that Myanmar military leaders should be prosecuted for genocide against Rohingya Muslims, taking the unusual step of identifying by name six of those it says were behind systematic crimes targeting the ethnic minority. The call amounted to some of the strongest language yet from U.N. officials who have denounced alleged human rights violations in Myanmar since a bloody crackdown began last August. The three-member 'fact-finding mission' and their team, working under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts from expatriate Rohingya, as well as satellite footage and other information for the report More[110] Sweden's Far Right Rises in a Campaign Defined by Immigration[111]  Consensus on the issue is giving way to polarization ahead of elections in the progressive bastion  Bojan Pancevski The Wall Street Journal Sept. 6, 2018  STR\u00c4NGN\u00c4S, Sweden With his gelled hair and jovial eloquence, Jimmie Akesson could have been mistaken for a talk-show host as he addressed a crowd recently in this idyllic lakeside town. In fact, Mr. Akesson is the leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats, a party with roots in neo-Nazism that is poised to become a leading political force in Sunday's elections. And he credits the rise to the party's stance on crime in Sweden, which is seeing rising rates of rape and of murder involving firearms that he blames on its liberal asylum policy. 'Our questioning of mass migration and how to push back against crime everybody is talking about that now. That's of course in our favor,' Mr. Akesson said in an interview after his campaign appearance, which featured a big screen that flashed crime statistics and images of burning cars. Nationalists and antiestablishment groups have flourished around Europe since a wave of refugees[112] sparked a crisis across the continent in 2015. But Sweden, one of the world's most affluent and progressive nations, is poised for a particularly dramatic swing from a broad liberal consensus to extreme polarization. Polls put the Sweden Democrats in first or second place, and either outcome could leave center-left and center-right blocs struggling to form a stable government. Sweden's economy is growing, jobs are plentiful and the welfare system leaves no one by the wayside. And overall crime rates, while high by Western European standards, remain low, particularly when compared with the U.S. Yet immigration has become the defining issue in the campaign, in part because many Swedes are rattled by surging violent crime in small urban enclaves populated mostly by people of foreign origin More[113] British Jews Have Reason to Fear Corbyn's Labour Party[114] The opposition leader has called Hamas terrorists 'brothers' and disparaged even domestic 'Zionists.' Dovid Efune The Wall Street Journal Sept. 5, 2018  Lord Jonathan Sacks isn't known to throw around accusations. So when the Commonwealth's former chief rabbi weighed in on Jeremy Corbyn, leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party, people took notice. Rabbi Sacks last week described Mr. Corbyn as 'an anti-Semite' who has 'given support to racists, terrorists and dealers of hate.' He called one Corbyn comment 'the most offensive statement made by a senior British politician since Enoch Powell's 1968 'Rivers of Blood' speech,' a vicious anti-immigration diatribe. Rabbi Sacks was referring to Mr. Corbyn's 2013 description of British 'Zionists': 'They don't want to study history and .\u00a0.\u00a0. they don't understand English irony either.' On Sunday Rabbi Sacks doubled down, telling the BBC that the prospect of Mr. Corbyn as prime minister was a 'danger' to British Jewry. In July, 68 leading U.K. rabbis had written an open letter to the Guardian accusing Labour's leadership of ignoring the Jewish community and the 'severe and widespread' anti-Semitism plaguing the party. Shortly after, in an unprecedented move, the country's three leading Jewish newspapers published joint cover stories describing the potential of a Corbyn-led government as an 'existential threat to Jewish life' in Britain But Mr. Corbyn and his acolytes are having none of it and have engaged in concerted efforts to undermine their critics. A Labour spokesman called Rabbi Sacks's comments 'absurd and offensive.' The party briefly put Ms. Hodge under investigation. Labourites who participated in a March protest over anti-Semitism were accused of attempting to smear the party leader and were threatened with dismissal from the party via a process known as 'deselection.' A letter endorsed by thousands of Corbyn supporters alleged that the gathering was the work of a 'very powerful special interest group.' For his part, Mr. Corbyn claimed in an interview: 'I'm not an anti-Semite in any way, never have been, never will be.' His actions and words tell a very different story. He was long associated unwittingly, he says, with Holocaust denier Paul Eisen. In 2012 he approved of a mural that grotesquely depicted Jewish bankers, and he did not reverse himself until earlier this year. He was long a member in Facebook[115] groups that featured anti-Jewish conspiracies.  His worst blind spot, though, is his failure to distinguish between criticism of Israeli policies and an irrational and thoroughly bigoted hatred of Israel itself. It's an obsession that has led him to align with those who oppose the idea of Jewish self-determination in the Levant, as well as those who have made their purpose to seek Israel's destruction, and even those who have murdered or championed the murder of Israelis and their supporters. In 2010 Mr. Corbyn hosted an event on Holocaust Memorial Day in which the Israeli government was compared to the Nazis. In 2012 he appeared on Iranian television to celebrate the release of Palestinian terrorists by Israel in a painful prisoner exchange with Hamas. He referred to the returning convicts as 'brothers.'

Dave A Royal Saudi Mess[1]: The disappearance of a journalist could mean a crisis in U.S.-Saudi ties. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  The disappearance of dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey last week is a debacle that could have far-reaching consequences for the Middle East and U.S. interests. </p><p>President Trump has to seek a full accounting lest he lose control of his foreign-policy agenda in the region. Mr. Khashoggi entered the consulate on Oct. 2 and there is no evidence he left alive. The Turks are whispering to everyone that they have audio surveillance tapes of Mr. Khashoggi's interrogation, torture and murder, though they have released nothing to the public. The Saudis deny foul play, but Turkish and U.S. intelligence say Saudi agents entered Turkey by private aircraft on the day that Mr. Khashoggi disappeared. The evidence is building that this was a kidnapping, or murder, ordered by senior officials in Riyadh.  All of this is a crisis for Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS, the 33-year-old Crown Prince who has been using authoritarian methods to reform Saudi Arabia's economy, politics and culture. The Trump Administration has formed an especially strong alliance with MBS, and that has made sense given his desire to contain Iran, his willingness to cooperate behind the scenes with Israel, and his modernization agenda. All of this is now at risk if MBS or one of his deputies ordered a hit on Mr. Khashoggi, who was arguably the Crown Prince's most important critic from his perch as a Washington Post columnist well known throughout the Arab world. MBS has developed a reputation for hell-bent decision-making, as in his war in Yemen. But it takes a special kind of reckless arrogance to think you can kidnap or kill a world-famous critic and get away with it inside a Saudi consulate on foreign soil. Vladimir Putin's critics are usually murdered in Russia. Mr. Khashoggi is a more complicated figure than the liberal democrat he is portrayed to be in the Western press. He is a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood and favors Islamic theocracy He has longtime ties to the Saudi royal family as a journalist and adviser, and some reports suggest MBS recently offered him a significant government post if he returned from exile in Washington, D.C. Some speculate that his refusal to accept that offer may have triggered the Saudi assault in Turkey. None of this justifies a brazen murder, if that's what happened, which would be a blunder and a crime. The fiasco puts enormous pressure on aging King Salman, who put the Crown Prince in charge. The Saudi royal family can be like feuding Borgias in the best of times, and the rivals of MBS will see a moment to strike at his power and agenda. The episode is not the fault of Mr. Trump or son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, despite the predictable claims of the American left. Any sensible U.S. Administration would support a Saudi reformer willing to help restrain Iranian military adventurism. But a murder of this sordid kind would inevitably have bilateral consequences. Senators of both parties are already warning that the episode, if proven, could lead to Magnitsky Act sanctions on the individuals involved. U.S. military aid and cooperation could be at risk. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham says there would be 'hell to pay.' While the Saudis could buy arms from the Russians or Chinese if Congress balks, the U.S. can't afford an unstable Kingdom that would be vulnerable to Iranian or Sunni radical subversion More[2] Trump defends policies in contentious 60 Minutes interview[3]: Jason Chaffetz joins The Next Revolution to discuss President Trump, Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia vows to retaliate if Trump follows through on 'severe punishment' threat over Khashoggi[4] Saudi Arabia is threatening to impose an oil embargoif the United States punishes it for murdering a dissident This is a sure sign of guiltThe Saudi consulate has security cameras at its exits and in its hallwaysIf Kashoggi had left the building, it would be easy to release videos of him doing so The fact that Saudi Arabia is making threats instead of showing the videosconfirms that the Saudis committed a ruthless and gruesome murder All the more reason to make energy independence a top national priorityWe should also make it a top priority to turn the U.S. into a major energy exporterand support energy production among its true allies We should also put a new emphasis on plug-in hybrids and electric vehiclespossibly by extending the tax credit incentives It should be a top priority of the U.S. to make Saudi Arabia irrelevant Dave Gregg Re Fox News October 14, 2018 Thegovernment of Saudi Arabia on Sunday vowed to retaliate with 'greater action' if the Trump administration punishes the country for the apparently preplannedmurder of a dissident earlier this month inside its Turkish Embassy. Jamal Khashoggi, who wrote columns in the Washington Post critical of the Saudi government, entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul October 2 and disappeared. Trump has said the U.S. would be 'very upset and angry' if the Saudi government was behind itand, in an interview with '60 Minutes,' he clarified that there would be 'severe punishment.' 'The Kingdom affirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by waving economic sanctions, using political pressure, or repeating false accusations,' the countrysaid in a statement[5] released by the Saudi Press Agency. 'The Kingdom also affirms that if it receives any action, it will respond with greater action, [and] that the Kingdom's economy has an influential and vital role in the global economy,' the statement continued More[6] Freedom for an American Hostage[7]: Trump used his leverage to bring pastor Andrew Brunson home. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Two years after being unjustly imprisoned in Turkey, the American pastor Andrew Brunson is coming home, thanks in no small part to President Trump. On Friday a Turkish court convicted Mr. Brunson on unsupported terrorism charges, yet sentenced him to time served. This leniency was purportedly for good behavior, but more likely a response to U.S. pressure. 'This is the day our family has been praying for,' Mr. Brunson said. 'My entire family thanks the President, the administration, and Congress for their unwavering support.'  Mr. Trump had repeatedly raised the evangelical pastor's detention with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. After that failed to produce results, the Treasury Department applied sanctions, under the Global Magnitsky Act, to the country's justice and interior ministers. As the lira went into free fall this summer, Mr. Trump announced he planned to double tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel. This was a hard line to take with a NATO ally. But Mr. Brunson never should have been arrested. Swept up in 2016 after a failed Turkish coup, he was essentially Mr. Erdogan's hostage. The strongman suggested he would free the pastor if the U.S. handed over Fethullah Gulen, an imam in Pennsylvania whom Mr. Erdogan accuses, without credible evidence, of plotting the coup. Credit to the White House for knowing when to ease up. After showing his seriousness, Mr. Trump softened his tone as Friday's court date approached, giving Mr. Erdogan room to back down.  Now the task is patching up relations with Turkey. U.S. officials have said Mr. Erdogan is also unjustly holding NASA scientist Serkan Golge, as well as employees of America's diplomatic mission More[8] Pastor Brunson's Deed of Derring-Do[9] Hugh Fitzgerald Jihad Watch Oct 14, 2018  Pastor Andrew Brunson has now been released from house arrest in Turkey and returned to the United States, but the lessons of his captivity should not be forgotten. In the long saga of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's refusal to release Brunson, the pastor was held for months in a single cell along with 17 Muslim prisoners accused, as he was initially, of 'G\u00fclenism.' Then he was placed under house arrest. The sheer craziness of Turkey's polity under Erdogan was on display as never before in the Brunson case. In the vast dragnet Erdogan ordered in Turkey after the attempted coup of mid-July 2016, his government detained more than 100,000 Turks, and arrested almost 50,000 of them, accused of being followers of Fethulleh G\u00fclen. In October 2016, Brunson, a pastor of the Presbyterian Evangelical Church, who had lived in Turkey for 23 years, ministering quietly to a church of 25 congregants, was arrested for being a 'terrorist' \u2014 the terrorists in question apparently being the G\u00fclenists. Among the absurdities offered into evidence by the prosecution, court documents claimed that a photo of maqluba, a popular Levantine rice dish, was found on Brunson's phone, sent to him by his daughter. The court documents describe maqluba as a 'G\u00fclenist delicacy.' Brunson was in one charge accused of having attended a G\u00fclenist event. In another, it was claimed that he spoke positively once about relations between Christians and the G\u00fclenist movement. Brunson was charged with 'membership in an armed terrorist organization,' 'gathering state secrets for espionage, attempting to overthrow the Turkish parliament and government, and to change the constitutional order.' But even that was not enough. He was accused not just of being a G\u00fclenist \u2014 that iPhone picture of maqluba being a dead giveaway \u2014 but also accused of being a collaborator with armed Kurdish groups, of visiting the YPG (a Kurdish militia group that Erdogan describes as 'terrorist') territory in Syria, and of wanting to Christianize Kurdistan and have it become a Christian state. And even that was not all. Pastor Brunson was also accused in the indictment of being a 'high-level member of the G\u00fclen movement' as well as an American spy, positioned to become CIA chief in Turkey had the 2016 coup attempt succeeded. It was alleged that Brunson fended off an assassination attempt thanks to his intelligence agency training, and there was speculation in the press that the CIA would assassinate Brunson in prison if it thought he would not be deported back to the U.S. For he knew too many secrets. All of these charges were both idiotic and fantastical. Pastor Brunson was exactly what he seemed to be: a dedicated Christian, who had tended his tiny flock of 25 congregants for more than 20 years, and had never visited, much less plotted with, Kurds in Syria, had never attended a single G\u00fclenist meeting, and had no plans either to take over and balkanize Turkey, nor to 'Christianize Kurdistan.' Another absurdity came in an article by one Mehmet Erdogan, a deputy from the ruling party, who accused Brunson of having served in the American military in Iraq, where he was, as a Marine, in charge of stealing gold bullion from the Iraqis worth hundreds of billions. The proof? A photograph of an American soldier, supposedly looking like Pastor Brunson, with the military name-tag of 'Brownm' holding up what was described as a 'gold bar.' In truth, the soldier in question did not look anything like Andrew Brunson, except in his crew-cut. The name 'Brown' may, to a Turk or Arab, seem similar to 'Brunson' (BRN-BRN), but not to anyone else. And the 'gold bar' being held up could not possibly have been of gold, because if it were, it would weigh 300 pounds. The 'gold bar' in question was not the right size for conventional gold bars. It was, in fact, part of a cache found in a truck in Iraq in 2003 that had originally been estimated to be worth $500 million. According to a Reuters report from August 1, 2003, later testing of the more than 1,000 bars that were found revealed they were not gold, but mostly copper and zinc. Experts said they were melted-down shell casings. And the true content of the bars was made in a report to Congress about the reconstruction effort More[10] Voices of Reason\u2014and Unreason[11]: Susan Collins put on a clinic in thoroughness and justice. Democrats need to stand up to the screamers. Peggy Noonan The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  What did the Kavanaugh controversy tell us about our historical moment? It underscored what we already know, that America is politically and culturally divided and that activists and the two parties don't just disagree with but dislike and distrust each other. We know also the Supreme Court has come to be seen not only as a constitutional (and inevitably political) body but as a cultural body. It follows cultural currents, moods, assumptions. It has frequently brushed past the concept of democratic modesty to make decisions that would most peacefully be left to the people, at the ballot box, after national debate. So citizens will experience the court as having great power over their lives, and nominations to the court will inevitably draw passion. And this was a fifth conservative seat on a nine-person court.  But the Kavanaugh hearings had some new elements. There were no boundaries on inquiry, no bowing to the idea of a private self. Accusations were made about the wording of captions under yearbook photos. The Senate showed a decline in public standards of decorum. A significant number of senators no longer even pretend to have class or imitate fairness. The screaming from the first seconds of the first hearings, the coordinated interruptions, the insistent rudeness and accusatory tones\u2014none of it looked like the workings of the ordered democracy that has been the envy of the world.  Two Republican senators this week wrote to me with a sound of mourning. One found it 'amazing' and 'terrifying' that 'seemingly, and without very much thought, nearly half the United States Senate has abandoned the presumption of innocence in this country, all to achieve a political goal.' The other cited 'a truly disturbing result: One of the great political parties abandoning the Constitutionally-based traditions of due process and presumption of innocence.' At the very least, Senate Democrats overplayed their hand A word on the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic Party. The howling and screeching that interrupted the hearings and the voting, the people who clawed on the door of the court, the ones who chased senators through the halls and screamed at them in elevators, who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife, who disrupted and brought an air of chaos, who attempted to thwart democratic processes so that the people could not listen and make their judgments: Do you know how that sounded to normal people, Republican and Democratic and unaffiliated? It sounded demonic. It didn't sound like 'the resistance' or #MeToo. It sounded like the shrieking in the background of an old audiotape of an exorcism. Democratic leaders should stand up to the screamers. They haven't, because they're afraid of them. But things like this spread and deepen. Stand up to your base. It's leading you nowhere good. And you know it More[12] Democrats Sing, the ABA Dances[13]: Will the lawyers' guild try to delegitimize the new Court Justice? Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  Brett Kavanaugh has already heard his first Supreme Court oral arguments, but Democrats are signaling they'll continue a campaign to undermine his standing. Let's hope the American Bar Association doesn't become their partisan handmaiden. Paul Moxley, head of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, wrote to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley in an Oct. 5 letter that the ABA committee is 'reopening' its 'evaluation' of Justice Kavanaugh. This is the same ABA committee that on August 30 gave the judge its highest rating in a report replete with praise. Now Mr. Moxley writes that this could change, given 'new information of a material nature regarding temperament during the September 27th hearing' in which Judge Kavanaugh defended himself against claims by Christine Blasey Ford. Mr. Moxley's letter landed more than a week after the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, though on the eve of the crucial full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It followed a public demand by ABA President Robert Carlson\u2014a Hillary Clinton donor\u2014to further delay the Senate vote with an FBI probe. The vote proceeded after that probe, and now the only purpose of an ABA re-evaluation would be to join the Democratic political campaign to delegitimize the new Justice and the current Supreme Court. Mr. Moxley seems like a straight-shooter, but if he's being bullied by Mr. Carlson or Democrats on his committee, he ought to resign and say so publicly. Otherwise he should shut down this revisionist exercise More[14] 'You Cannot Be Civil'[15]: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on the current state of the Democratic party. Daniel Henninger The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  At a time when it's said that anything is possible in American politics, the impossible just happened. Hillary Clinton has aligned herself with Donald Trump's view of the Democratic Party.  Mr. Trump has been using his political rallies to denounce 'the radical Democrats' as 'an angry mob.' On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton told CNN: 'You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.' You cannot be civil. Behold the Trump sun and the Clinton moon in a moment of political eclipse.  It's hard to pick out exactly when in the past month the Democrats shifted the national focus away from Mr. Trump and onto their own behavior. I'd say it was the Senate's final vote Saturday on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. Democrats had thrown everything at Judge Kavanaugh, and it was over. But not in the Senate gallery. On cue, literally, spectators started shrieking at the senators on the floor. Guards moved toward the chamber's doors, and the vote stopped while the screamers were removed.  During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was Jeane Kirkpatrick, who in some ways was a template for Nikki Haley's U.N. tenure as an unapologetic defender of America's interests. At the Republicans' 1984 national convention, Kirkpatrick delivered a speech memorable for one phrase\u2014'the San Francisco Democrats.' The idea behind 'the San Francisco Democrats' has never died. It stands for a party of the unelectable left. That year, Reagan defeated Walter Mondale by 525 to 13 electoral votes.  Democrats will complain it is beyond chutzpah for Donald Trump to brand them as divisive or radical after he has spent his presidency polarizing the electorate with his rhetoric and Twitter[16] account. Maybe, but that was then. Whatever else was at issue in the midterm elections, it has been overtaken by the Kavanaugh nomination, which transfixed the nation for weeks.  The Democrats were in OK shape through phase one of the Kavanaugh hearings, a sometimes intense back-and-forth about his judicial beliefs. But it was phase two\u2014the Christine Blasey Ford weeks, brought forth by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Democratic Party activists\u2014that defined the battle lines for the November elections.  The hearings began as a familiar narrative\u2014Republicans are hostile to women. But that spun out of control into broader issues of fundamental fairness and due process. In conversations I've had recently with Democrats, once past the Kavanaugh arguments, most express a desire for more political civility. This is wishful thinking. The party has a problem: The San Francisco Democrats are back the Kavanaugh episode shows that the party is being taken over by what I would call the Code Pink Left.  The professional network of the Code Pink Left, typified by the George-Soros-funded woman who trapped Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator, has virtually no interest in substantive policy goals. The Code Pink Left specializes in creating political story lines or 'frames'\u2014such as that conservatives are weak on sexual abuse\u2014which it promotes with theatrical protests, distributes on social media, and depends on mainstream media for constant repetition. This is something familiar. It is called agitprop. The goal is to make the broader electorate nervous and doubtful. It worked. Many voters are now nervous about the Democrats' street-fighting men and women. Every Republican from Trump down to dogcatcher is running against the Democrats' 'angry mob' of Senate screamers and restaurant marauders More[17] Patriot Prayer Rally for 'Law and Order' Faces Antifa Violence[18] Penny Starr Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 The streets of Portland, Oregon, became violent over the weekend as the right-wing Patriot Prayer group clashed with black-clad and masked Antifa as ongoing protests and counter-protests in the city often go unchecked by police. The violent clash on Saturday came after a protest on Friday was held following the death of Patrick Kimmons, whom police shot on September 30 after he allegedly shot two other men. At Friday's protest, a 74-year-old man drove through a crowd of protesters who responded by attacking the car and breaking a window. The incident was captured[19] on video. 'Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler came under fire over a viral video showing Antifa protesters blocking traffic and harassing drivers, but he says he supports the decision by police to watch from a distance without getting involved,' the Washington Times reported[20]. 'I was appalled by what I saw in the video, but I support the Portland Police Bureau's decision not to intervene,' Wheelersaid[21] at a Friday press conference. 'This whole incident will be investigated.' That's when Patriot Prayer organized what it billed as a 'law and order' rally[22] on Saturday to demand Portland police respond to such violence and called for Wheeler to resign. But when they arrived on Saturday, they were met by Antifa counter-protesters. Journalist Andy Ngo captured much of the clash between the two groups on video, which he tweeted as it unfolded 'The American Divide: One side chants, 'USA!' Masked side chants, 'black lives matter!'' Ngo tweeted 'And then it became a full-on brawl \u2014 with lots of pepper spray flying everywhere. I couldn't really see what I was recording until now. #Portland,' Ngo tweeted. 'The mayor has been accused of taking a kid-gloves approach to the protests that routinely roil the liberal enclave, such as the summer occupation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, which saw Portland police refuse to assist unless federal officers were in physical danger,' the Times reported More[23] Alec Baldwin calls for 'overthrow' of Trump at Dem fundraiser in New Hampshire[24] Paul Steinhauser Fox News October 15, 2018 MANCHESTER, N.H. - Less than 24 hours after reprising his Emmy Award-winning parody of President Trump on 'Saturday Night Live,' Alec Baldwin took aim at the president again. 'In an orderly and formal way, and lawful way, we need to overthrow the government of the United States under Donald Trump,' Baldwin said Sunday night at a major fundraising dinner for New Hampshire's Democratic Party The video and more[25] Is 'First, Kill All the Lawyers' the Democrats' New Credo?[26] Their cries that the Supreme Court has been 'corrupted' evoke the rhetoric of totalitarians. George Melloan The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Democrats don't want to kill all the lawyersJust the ones associated with President Trump Dave In Shakespeare's 'Henry VI,' Jack Cade promises a coup that will make him king, after which 'all the realm shall be in common' with bounties for all. To which the murderous Dick the Butcher replies, 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.' This oft-quoted line has become a lawyer's joke, but Shakespeare no doubt also wanted to convey revolutionary zeal. If you destroy lawyers, you also do in the law. That would have suited Dick fine.  Fast forward to last Saturday, after Brett Kavanaugh concluded his own dramatic turn on the world stage by ascending to the Supreme Court. His Democratic tormentors, including California's 85-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein, don't want the drama to end. Up went the hue and cry that Justice Kavanaugh would 'taint' future Supreme Court decisions. The Atlantic's Adam Serwer didn't leave it at that, screaming that all three branches of government had been befouled by 'Trumpist corruption.' Maybe it's time for the Democrats to calm down. They probably aren't aware of it, since reading history has gone out of style, but their hatred of Donald Trump has now boiled over into what sounds like an attack on America's institutions. As the party of the left, they should be more careful about any such suggestion. Modern history records that it is the left, not the right, that has been more culpable in destroying institutions that protected citizens from authoritarian rule.  Mrs. Feinstein should know better. For someone in her position to suggest that Justice Kavanaugh's appointment 'undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court,' as she tweeted Saturday, is not quite equivalent to suggesting that we kill all the lawyers. But it does strike a blow against the sanctity of the judiciary. That is an offense more serious than the senator likely intended. It constitutes an attack on the rule of law\u2014an institution at the heart of the much admired and widely emulated success of the American experiment in self-government.  Other large nations have tried similar experiments, which too often have led to disastrous failures. It is often forgotten that the Russians attempted to make representative government work, electing their first State Duma, or parliament, in 1906 and making some progress over 11 years until the effort was shattered by revolution. Lenin said the Bolsheviks 'found power lying in the streets and simply picked it up.' We know how that turned out; the Russian people are still living with its legacy It is not a good omen when leaders of a major party and its adherents in the press seem to justify lawlessness simply because they don't like the president the country elected. In National Review Online last weekend, Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, reviews recent warning signs of this turn to lawlessness. One example was the FBI's use in 2016 of a fake dossier manufactured by the Democrats as a reason to spy on the Trump campaign. Under the title 'The Left Criminalizes Politics By Weaponizing Investigations,' Mr. McCarthy writes of the Kavanaugh hearings: 'The world has changed. People who care nothing about norms can no longer be dismissed as a fringe. For generations, left-wing activists have instructed students and other groups that norms are the building blocks of a rigged system that deprives them of power and denies their 'selfless' desires We don't want to acknowledge what this has wrought. We have norms because they safeguard foundational principles, such as due process, the presumption of innocence, and freedom from unreasonable and unwarranted police prying. But the Left is no longer attached to those principles.' More[27] Rep. John Ratcliffe: Fusion GPS Founder Glenn Simpson 'in Real Legal Jeopardy'[28] Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Rep. John Ratcliffe (R-TX) toldFox News'sSunday Morning FutureshostMaria Bartiromo on Sunday that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson is in 'real legal jeopardy.' Glenn Simpson's lawyer notified Congress that his clientwill invoke hisFifthAmendment right not to testify before the House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committees next week. A partial transcript is as follows The video and more[29] Who Is Michael Sussmann?[30] The FBI's general counsel met with a Clinton lawyer in September 2016. Kimberley A. Strassel The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  When Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked about the origin of the infamous Trump dossier, James Comey brushed off most of the questions. The former Federal Bureau of Investigations director said someone on his 'senior staff'\u2014he couldn't remember who\u2014had 'briefed' him on the dossier 'sometime in the fall' of 2016. Mr. Comey had been told it came 'from a reliable source.' He insisted he 'never knew exactly which Democrats had funded' it. He then continued on about his book, which meditated on the importance of 'truth.' That interview, in April 2018, is relevant in light of a recent report from the Hill's John Solomon that James Baker, the FBI's general counsel from 2014-17, met 'weeks before the 2016 election' with a lawyer from Perkins Coie. That's the firm that hired Fusion GPS to compile the dossier on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.  My sources confirm that the Perkins partner who bent Mr. Baker's ear and handed over documents was Michael Sussmann, point man for the firm's DNC and Clinton campaign accounts. They also confirm the subject of the meeting was Russian interference in the election, including hacking and supposed ties to Donald Trump. Much of this comes from an interview House investigators conducted last week with Mr. Baker.  The significance of this revelation is enormous for everything from FBI investigatory malpractice, to its dishonesty, to its current fight with the White House over document disclosure. That the FBI's general counsel was even meeting with a top lawyer for the Clinton campaign shortly before the election is proof of that the bureau strayed beyond obvious guardrails.  It's alarming enough that the FBI felt free to open a counterintelligence investigation into an active presidential campaign. That it also felt free to gather information for that probe from the opposing campaign is mind-boggling. Team Clinton had the most powerful position on earth to gain from Mr. Trump's downfall. No conflict there, right?  It is unclear whether Mr. Sussmann supplied any dossier-related information to Mr. Baker. But we know from the House Intelligence Committee's February Russia memo that 'senior DOJ and FBI officials' by this time knew the DNC and the Clinton campaign were behind the dossier. The Baker-Sussmann meeting raises the likelihood that those 'senior officials' extended into Mr. Comey's inner circle and that quite a few people understood the bureau was moving against a campaign based on the rival campaign's opposition research. Yet those officials marched into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and never revealed in any of their warrant applications that the dossier was a product of the Clinton campaign. It now appears the FBI also didn't tell the court that its investigation had been informed directly by a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sussmann, as a former Justice Department employee, would presumably add credibility to any FISA application\u2014unless the FBI was worried about revealing how much it was relying on the Clinton camp. By the way, Mr. Baker told congressional investigators that he personally reviewed the initial FISA application. The news of this meeting also gives cause to doubt the FBI's stated reasons for refusing to release documents to Congress The Baker-Sussmann revelation underscores that we will never get the truth about the FBI's behavior until those documents are made public. Mr. Trump: Disclose More[31] Hillary Clinton: 'The Way Trump Debated Me, It Was Imbued with Sexism'[32] Pam Key Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 On this weekend's broadcast of CBS's 'Sunday Morning,' 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton complained the'way Trump debated' her was 'imbued with sexism.' When asked if she really has a 'file on sexism in politics,' Clinton said, 'I do. I do. It's a file that tells a somewhat sobering story about how hard it is to break through the mindsets that people have. And it is difficult for many people, not just men, a lot of women, to think, wait a minute, this woman is going to be a governor or a member of Congress or my mayor or maybe even a president.' She added, 'If you watched the way Trump debated me, it was imbued with sexism. Making fun of me for preparing\u2014that's the old like, 'Oh, yeah, the girl in the class who is always prepared, I don't need to be prepared.'' The video[33] NBC Belatedly Corrects Fake News Story on Trump and Robert E.

Lee at a rally in Ohio, misquoting the president and leaving out the context that he was setting up praise of Union General Ulysses S. Grant. When the Fever Passes, Learn From Trump's Taxes[35]: The tax code isn't just the rates but the loopholes and gray areas. Moving on to the next ploy Democrats are going to tryin their efforts to impeach President Trump Dave Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Last Saturday's column[36] on the New York Times investigation of Trump family tax dodging put aside the question of whether hefty inheritance taxes are good public policy. Let's take it up now. Those who complained that my nondefense 'normalized' Trump-era corruption miss an obvious fact. The events took place 30 years ago. It was already normalized. The Times itself has now run two [37]op-eds[38] making the same point. The appraiser who valued Trump property for tax purposes, according to the paper's investigation, was a 'favorite of New York City's big real-estate families.' Trump family lawyers and accountants were the same ones used by other real-estate developers. The family's returns were approved and accepted by the New York State Department of Taxation and the Internal Revenue Service. You might ask: If Times reporters can decide 30 years after the fact the Trumps didn't pay enough taxes, why didn't enforcement agencies decide so at the time? Trump projects were important to the city. The Trumps were big donors. Fred Trump (whose taxes we're mostly talking about) had been tight with Mayor Abe Beame. Trump advisers would have known to a fine degree what they could get away with because they'd been working the angles for many years on behalf of many clients. Beware of the Times's assumptions about the valuations morass. Not everything is required to be valued at market prices. There's a lesson here. The tax code isn't just the rates but the loopholes and gray areas. An intelligent person wonders why it's so full of features that work at cross-purposes. Unfortunately, a lot of people have an interest in a complicated tax system, politicians most of all. They want credit for soaking the rich, but they also want to be on friendly terms with their rich constituents, and they don't want the economic consequences of deterring work and investment More[39] Rutgers Postpones Alum's Speaking Appearance on Free Speech After Islamophobia Accusations[40]  Fox News Insider October 13, 2018 A Rutgers University alumna had her lecture on free speech postponed by the university after a petition by students began circulating, accusing her of Islamophobia. Lisa Daftari was scheduled to speak at Rutgers on 'Radicalism on College Campuses' next Tuesday and was invited by the institution.

Pro-life activist assaulted by abortion protester on campus[43] Unhinged Dave Caleb Parke Fox News October 13, 2018 Police are investigating an incident in Toronto caught on camera where an abortion protester attacked a female pro-life activist. Gabriela 'Gabby' Skwarko, a student at Ryerson University in Ontario who works for the school's Office of Social Innovation and is part of the Ryerson Reproductive Justice Collective, is seen in a video attacking two members of Toronto Against Abortion (TAA). 'I was shocked and terrified,' TAA Director Katie Somerstold Fox News. 'When I cried out in pain I kind of thought she would leave me alone but it seemed to make no difference to her.' Blaise Alleyne, president and founder of TAA, said Skwarko launched the attack out of nowhere as the anti-abortion group was getting to wrap up for the day. 'I don't like seeing my friends get beat up in the street,' Alleyne said. 'We're in the business of exposing violence to end it. We're shining a light on this deplorable behavior. Assaulting somebody for having a conversation is not acceptable. We want to expose it and end it.' Skwarko allegedly targeted Somers and Alleyne for their role in the pro-life group. She kicked over signs, fell on top of one, landing on Somers. Then she threw a metal cart at Somers and ran toward her, grabbed her backpack and reached in, took out her stainless steel water bottle, andthrew it on the ground. She shoved Somers and then bumped Alleyne in the chest. 'Let's go! C'mon,' Skwarko said, taunting the pro-life advocates. EMS and police were immediately called. The Toronto Police Service and the Ryerson Student Conduct Office are currently investigating the situation. Skwardo is temporarily forbidden from contacting Alleyene, who is a part-time student at Ryerson, and from going within 100 meters of him or any pro-life demonstration he is involved in. As a result of Skwarko's attack, Somers has taken time off work to heal, including an injury to her wrist and bruising down her right leg. The incident comes just a day after a video went viral of a pro-choice activist, Jordan Hunt, a Toronto hairstylist who lost his job and was arrested last week for violently kicking a female pro-life activist after he tried to steal [44]one[45] of their signs[46] More[47] Is a War Memorial's Cross Illegal?[48] Three federal judges decide a century-old monument violates the Constitution. Jeremy Dys The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  As a lowly corporal, Milton Edward Hartman's death shouldn't have drawn much attention. But on July 19, 1919: 'The whole countryside came to the memorial service, thronged the church and filled the churchyard ten feet deep around the church, listening and participating through the open doors and windows.' Yet Cpl. Hartman's body wasn't there. He was killed in France on Oct. 10, 1918. Like too many U.S. Army infantrymen who fell in World War I, he was buried in an American cemetery on European soil Today few remember the names of men who made the ultimate sacrifice. Their mothers knew that people often forget what they do not see. With that in mind, Gold Star mothers from Prince George's County, Md., sought to preserve some of these names. In 1919 they embarked on a mission to construct a concrete and bronze, cross-shaped memorial featuring the names of their sons, including Hartman.  In 1925, these mothers and the American Legion dedicated the Bladensburg World War I Veterans Memorial to the memory of these men. Martha Redman, who lost her son William F. Redman in World War I, explained that she considered the memorial to be her son's 'grave stone.' Yet after years of litigation, a three-judge panel of the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined this year that this memorial is unlawful. According to the court, the memorial's cross shape violates the Constitution. Chief Judge Roger Gregory dissented from the decision to deny a review of the case before the full Fourth Circuit. 'Nearly a century ago, Maryland citizens, out of deep respect and gratitude, took on the daunting task of erecting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so nobly advanced,' he wrote. 'The panel majority says their effort violates the Constitution the soldiers fought to defend. I, respectfully, think otherwise.' Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III also understood the importance of the memorial, writing in his dissent: 'The dead cannot speak for themselves. But may the living hear their silence.' Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, also dissenting, wrote that the Fourth Circuit's decision 'offends the monument's commemoration of those soldiers' sacrifice. Moreover, it puts at risk hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of similar monuments.'  A few miles from Bladensburg is Arlington National Cemetery. Unless the Supreme Court agrees to hear our appeal and overturns the Fourth Circuit's decision, the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, the Argonne Cross, and perhaps the Tomb of the Unknowns\u2014itself originally a World War I veterans monument inscribed with language intertwining the poetic and religious\u2014could face desecration and demolition. That's only at Arlington. Within 40 miles of Bladensburg are similar monuments employing religious symbolism to commemorate lost soldiers. Countless others across the country share a similar design. There's a reason for that. Judge Niemeyer explained: 'The monument's use of the cross shape mirrors the custom in Europe during World War I.' He also correctly observed that the Fourth Circuit's decision 'will now have the monument removed or destroyed because, as it concludes, its presence on public land amounts to a violation of the Establishment Clause, although no Supreme Court case has ever held that the Establishment Clause prohibits such monuments.' Alvergia Guyton is the niece of John Henry Seaburn, a soldier who joined the segregated U.S. Army when he was 16. He fought with the African-American 372nd Infantry Regiment, 93rd Division of the French army during the war. Reflecting on the prospect that the memorial could be destroyed, she told a reporter, 'It's history, and people can't see it when they start tearing it down. You're robbing the next generation.' More[49] The Price of BernieCare[50]: Democrats object that Republicans are telling voters the truth about single payer. BernieCare sounds like the Cloward-Piven strategy[51] for bankrupting America Dave Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  Chuck Schumer declared this week that health care is the issue that will define the November elections, and the Senate Minority Leader may be right for the wrong reason. Democrats could end up paying a big political price for signing up en masse for Bernie Sanders's government-run health-care agenda. Republicans are running ads slamming Democrats on single-payer health care, and President Trump framed the issue this week in a USA Today op-ed that said 'Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.' Democrats claim this is unfair because not every candidate has endorsed single payer, but if they now want to repudiate it they should say so. Mr. Trump is referring to the Bernie Sanders bill known as Medicare for All, which has been endorsed by 16 Senators, including almost all of the left's leading 2020 presidential contenders (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren).  A companion House bill has attracted more than 120 co-sponsors, which is nearly two-thirds of the current Democratic caucus. Other devotees include the Democratic nominees for Governor in California (Gavin Newsom) and Florida (Andrew Gillum) and dozens of other candidates around the country. Did Democrats think they could endorse this to please their progressive base but then have no one notice? Medicare for All would finance health care through taxes instead of insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays. All care would then be 'free' in the Venezuelan sense of the word. Government would dramatically cut the reimbursement rates doctors receive for providing services. All this would lower administrative costs and make health care more efficient, or so we're told. And we're not supposed to call this 'government-run health care,' though who do you think would make the payment decisions? Mr. Trump noted in his op-ed that the plan would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over 10 years. That figure is from an analysis by the Mercatus Center's Charles Blahous, a respected researcher and a former Social Security and Medicare trustee who sometimes writes for us. His findings are in the ballpark of every serious analysis. That spending figure amounts to 10.7% of GDP in 2022 when the plan kicks in and then up from there. National defense\u2014routinely derided as too expensive and wasteful\u2014is a mere 3% of GDP today. And brace yourself: 'Doubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan,' Mr. Blahous says More[52] In 'The Good Censor,' Google Admitted to Censorship \u2014 And The Media Ignored It[53] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Earlier this week, Breitbart News released 'The Good Censor,'[54] an 85-page internal company presentation created by Google, explaining in frank terms that the handful of big tech companies that dominate the internet have 'shifted towards censorship.' The response from the establishment media? Virtually nothing. There were a couple notable exceptions.The Daily Mail ran a detailed story[55] about the leak, as did The Hill. And The Verge, part of the far-left Vox Media empire, ran two stories on the leak - although they mostly defended Google's right to censor in the name of 'safety and security.' BuzzFeed's Charlie Warzel called the leaked presentation 'incredibly fascinating[56]' in a social media post, but BuzzFeed itself has thus far failed to cover it. The conservative media did much better, with coverage in The Western Journal, World Net Daily, LifeSite, Fox News, NewsBusters, and The Daily Wire. But most of the mainstream 'tech media' seems more interested in reviewing Google's latest smartphone[57] than the company's candid acknowledgment that the masters of the digital universe have largely abandoned the internet's founding principles of freedom and openness. Why the silence? Perhaps they buy Google's explanation that the presentation was just 'research' and doesn't reflect 'official Google positions' \u2014 a confusing explanation, as the research isaboutofficialGoogle positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers' assessment of where the company is headed? A more likely explanation for the media turning a blind eye to the presentation is that they basically agree with it, and find nothing uncontroversial about its declaration that tech companies have abandoned the 'American tradition' of free speech in favor of the 'European tradition' of protecting everyone's feelings. Here's how The Verge puts it: 'Almost all of us would agree that some restrictions on free speech are necessary. But few of us would agree on what those restrictions should be. Being a good censor \u2014 or at least, a more consistent censor \u2014 is within Google's grasp. But being a politically neutral one is probably impossible.' According to the author of the piece, censorship is difficult in practice but still good in theory. What's more, being a 'good censor' is 'within Google's grasp' \u2014 even if that censorship isn't politically neutral. Harvard's Nieman Lab, a purportedly respectable institution of establishment journalism, didn't just ignore The Good Censor \u2014 it praised it. Nieman Lab's piece was gushing[58] in its assessment of the presentation, calling it 'insightful and interesting,' going so far as to suggest that Google should have voluntarily made it public. Why the praise? A clue is in the list of bullet points the Nieman Lab author uses to summarize The Good Censor: at the very top is Google's distinction between 'authoritative sources' and 'have-a-go commentators.' Google bemonas that in an environment of total free speech, the opinions of ordinary people can compete with sources likeThe New York Timeson an even playing field. It's easy to see why the Nieman Lab, a pillar of establishment journalism, would applaud this assessment More[59] 80 Percent Of Americans Think Political Correctness Is A National Problem[60]  Contrary to a common narrative, majorities of Americans of all ages, income levels, and racial backgrounds strongly oppose political correctness.  Don't let the PC bunch intimidate youIt is time for the 'silent majority' to stand up to these guilt-flinging bullies Dave Joy Pullmann The Federalist October 12, 2018 Eighty percent of Americans say'political correctness is a problem in our country,' according to newly released data from a nationally representative poll drawing upon 8,000 survey respondents, 30 one-hour interviews, and six focus group. Some of this data, compiled with help from YouGov, has been newly released in a report called 'Hidden Tribes[61].' Objections to political correctness are even stronger among racial minorities and those who have never attended college. High-income college graduates, especially those with advanced degrees, are the Americans most likely to think political correctness is not a problem. These are also the group most likely to label themselves atheists or agnostics, and identify as politically liberal. Contrary to a common cultural narrative, the poll finds large majorities of Americans of all ages, income levels, and racial backgrounds oppose political correctness, even while 82 percent also think 'hate speech' is a problem. This may suggest Americans believe thought and speech censorship is not the best way to address rude and discriminatory behavior. Opposition to political correctness was higher among Asians (82 percent), Hispanics (87 percent), and American Indians (88 percent) than among white Americans (79 percent). In fact, just about every single demographic studied showed overwhelming objection to political correctness except the Americans the study reporting the poll results identified as 'progressive activists.'Progressive activists, the study says, 'have an outsized rolein political discourse, even though they comprisea small portion of the total population (about 1 in12 Americans).' About the 8 Percent of People Love PC 'Progressive activists are the only group that strongly backs political correctness: Only 30 percent see it as a problem,' wrote Harvard University lecturer Yascha Mounk in an overview of the poll results[62] at The Atlantic More[63] The Scourge of 'Diversity'[64]: A onetime liberal, Heather Mac Donald now believes identity politics threatens higher education and civilization itself. Jillian Kay Melchior The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Heather Mac Donald may be best known for braving angry collegiate mobs, determined to prevent her from speaking last year in defense of law enforcement In her new book, 'The Diversity Delusion,' Ms. Mac Donald, 61, explores how identity politics has diverted higher education from more elevated subjects. She warns of this ideology's spread to other cultural institutions and industries\u2014Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street She thinks conservatives miss the point when they focus on the due-process infirmities of campus sexual-misconduct tribunals. She doesn't believe there's a campus 'rape epidemic,' only a lot of messy, regrettable and mutually degrading hookups. 'To say the solution to all of this is simply more lawyering up is ridiculous because this is really, fundamentally, about sexual norms.' Society once assumed 'no' was women's default response to sexual propositions. 'That put power in the hands of females,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'You didn't have to bargain every time you didn't want to have sex. The male had to bargain you into yes. But you could say no, and you didn't have to exhaust yourself.' Sexual liberationists claimed men and women were alike, and chivalry and feminine modesty were oppressive. 'Now, the default for premarital sex is yes,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'That gives enormous power to the male libido' at the expense of women. The #MeToo movement is one reflection of this reality, but so is the growing realization that consensual sex isn't always healthy sex When it comes to race She argues that minorities could overcome economic and educational disparities by embracing 'bourgeois values.' She opposes all forms of affirmative action, and believes admissions and hiring should be based solely on aptitude tests and objective measures of performance Even when disadvantaged students truly have shown exceptional work ethic, unless their test scores pass muster, 'I think the mismatch is far too powerful a problem.' That refers to the theory that preferences set up their intended beneficiaries for failure. They're suddenly expected to perform beyond their proven capabilities and to compete with peers who earned admission through merit. This helps explain why universities may feel racially hostile despite the best efforts of admissions officers, faculty and administrators. Minority students may be excluded from study groups or chosen last for class projects because of aptitude, not race. 'That's heartbreaking,' Ms. Mac Donald says, 'but if you come to a university with one or two standard deviations below your peers of academic qualifications, the gap doesn't close.'  So without affirmative action, how can kids born into poverty and dysfunction ever escape their circumstances? Ms. Mac Donald questions the premise: 'What I also find striking about the defenses of racial preferences is the extraordinary snobbery and elitism on the part of the most selective schools\u2014the assumption is that unless you go to Harvard or UC Berkeley, life is over for you,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'To escape poverty, you just need to graduate from high school, hold a job\u2014any job, minimum-wage job, full-time\u2014and wait until you get married to have children. Nearly three-fourths of all people who follow those simple rules are not poor.' Some conservatives attempt to match the hyperbole and theatrics of campus progressives. That isn't Ms. Mac Donald's approach 'to see me as a 'provocateur' is kind of ridiculous,' she adds.  Leftist mobs don't make that distinction. As Ms. Mac Donald recalls the night in April 2017 when she needed a police escort and spoke to an empty hall at Claremont McKenna College, she stiffens, crosses her arms, and speaks softly. The shades were pulled down at a guest suite-turned-safe house, she recalls, and the crowd outside grew louder and louder, chanting and wailing and drumming. 'I don't want to sound melodramatic about this, because I was obviously not at huge risk of any physical danger,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'But I did feel somewhat of an understanding of what the victims of the French Revolution felt, in waiting for the guillotine. Because you hear a mob that is, in fact, hysterical. And you don't know what's going to happen next.' What worries Ms. Mac Donald more than the mob is the destructive power of its animating ideas. If the university continues its decline, how will knowledge be passed on to the next generation, or new knowledge created? Ms. Mac Donald also warns of a rising white identity politics\u2014'an absolutely logical next step in the metastasizing of identity politics.' 'One of the great achievements of Western European civilization was to move beyond tribalism, to nation-states, to concepts of citizenship that transcend tribal identity,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'And we've been playing with fire for the last 40 years in thinking we can keep this ethnic warfare thing at a low simmer rather than a hot boil.'

Since February,Breitbart Newshas reported[70] how the Trump administration is set toenforce[71]an existing law whereby foreign nationals seeking to permanently resettle in the U.S. would need to prove that they will not become drains on the American taxpayer. Such a plan would be a boon for American taxpayers, who currently spend[72] about$57.4 billiona year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year.

Venezuelan Socialist Leader on Suspect Opposition Leader's Death: Respect Choice of Suicide[78] Ahhhh The joys of Socialism Dave Ben Kew Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Leading Venezuelan socialist Diosdado Cabello declared[79] on Thursday that people 'must respect' the decision of an opposition lawmaker to commit suicide, despite no evidence suggesting he chose to kill himself. Fernando Albn, a local councilman from Caracas, died[80] in police custody on Monday shortly after returning from New York. According toVenezuelan officials, Albn threw himself from the tenth floor of Secret Police (Sebin) headquarters after being interrogated by officials. Officials offered conflicting stories on whether Albn chose to jump from the main officers of the building or asked to go to the restroom and then took the alleged plunge. 'They say he could not have killed himself because he was a Catholic. Isn't there proof that there are Catholics priests with children? Where does it say they can do that? It's absurd,' Cabello said on his state television showCon El Mazo Dando ('Hitting with the Mallet'). 'He took the decision and we have to respect that because it is the life of a human being.' Authorities arrested Albn at Caracas airport last Fridaywho claimed they had evidencelinking[81]Albn to a failed droneassassination attempt on Maduro at a military event the capital in August. The country's attorney general William Tarek Saab claimed that Albn requested to use a bathroom on the tenth floor of the Sebin facility and jumped out of the bathroom window to his death. Opposition and foreign governments rejected this explanation and accused officials of torturing and murdering the politician. A spokeswoman for the U.N. rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, told reporters[82] that the Maduro regime had 'an obligation to ensure (Alban's) safety, personal integrity, and dignity We are concerned about news of his death We do indeed call for a transparent investigation to clarify the circumstances of his death.' More[83] China Acknowledges Re-Education Centers for Uighurs[84] Beijing had previously denied it was detaining members of the ethnic minority in centers, a campaign that has sparked an international outcry Eva Dou The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  BEIJING\u2014China has retroactively changed the law to legitimize its detention of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs in a campaign that has sparked an international outcry over human rights abuses against the ethnic minority. The amended counterterrorism regulations, adopted Tuesday in the northwest Xinjiang region where most Uighurs live, say that authorities can use 'vocational skills training centers' to 'deradicalize' people suspected of extremism. The previous rules made no reference to vocational centers. The new rules appear to mark the first time China has acknowledged its use of vocational centers to detain Xinjiang residents for 'transformation through education.' Senior Chinese officials have maintained\u2014including before a United Nations panel[85] in August\u2014that the centers taught vocational skills to petty criminals. It had disputed reports the centers were used for 'political re-education.' The new regulations 'establish a much more direct link between re-education and vocational skills training,' said Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the Xinjiang camps at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. Criticism is growing over China's mass detention of Uighurs. A U.S. Congressional report[86] released on Wednesday warned of a 'dire human rights situation' in China, particularly the country's mass internment of Uighurs and other minorities. The U.N. panel in August found that Uighurs were being held for extended periods without charge or trial 'under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism.'

Dave A Royal Saudi Mess[1]: The disappearance of a journalist could mean a crisis in U.S.-Saudi ties. Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  The disappearance of dissident Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey last week is a debacle that could have far-reaching consequences for the Middle East and U.S. interests. </p><p>President Trump has to seek a full accounting lest he lose control of his foreign-policy agenda in the region. Mr. Khashoggi entered the consulate on Oct. 2 and there is no evidence he left alive. The Turks are whispering to everyone that they have audio surveillance tapes of Mr. Khashoggi's interrogation, torture and murder, though they have released nothing to the public. The Saudis deny foul play, but Turkish and U.S. intelligence say Saudi agents entered Turkey by private aircraft on the day that Mr. Khashoggi disappeared. The evidence is building that this was a kidnapping, or murder, ordered by senior officials in Riyadh.  All of this is a crisis for Mohammed bin Salman, aka MBS, the 33-year-old Crown Prince who has been using authoritarian methods to reform Saudi Arabia's economy, politics and culture. The Trump Administration has formed an especially strong alliance with MBS, and that has made sense given his desire to contain Iran, his willingness to cooperate behind the scenes with Israel, and his modernization agenda. All of this is now at risk if MBS or one of his deputies ordered a hit on Mr. Khashoggi, who was arguably the Crown Prince's most important critic from his perch as a Washington Post columnist well known throughout the Arab world. MBS has developed a reputation for hell-bent decision-making, as in his war in Yemen. But it takes a special kind of reckless arrogance to think you can kidnap or kill a world-famous critic and get away with it inside a Saudi consulate on foreign soil. Vladimir Putin's critics are usually murdered in Russia. Mr. Khashoggi is a more complicated figure than the liberal democrat he is portrayed to be in the Western press. He is a longtime member of the Muslim Brotherhood and favors Islamic theocracy He has longtime ties to the Saudi royal family as a journalist and adviser, and some reports suggest MBS recently offered him a significant government post if he returned from exile in Washington, D.C. Some speculate that his refusal to accept that offer may have triggered the Saudi assault in Turkey. None of this justifies a brazen murder, if that's what happened, which would be a blunder and a crime. The fiasco puts enormous pressure on aging King Salman, who put the Crown Prince in charge. The Saudi royal family can be like feuding Borgias in the best of times, and the rivals of MBS will see a moment to strike at his power and agenda. The episode is not the fault of Mr. Trump or son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner, despite the predictable claims of the American left. Any sensible U.S. Administration would support a Saudi reformer willing to help restrain Iranian military adventurism. But a murder of this sordid kind would inevitably have bilateral consequences. Senators of both parties are already warning that the episode, if proven, could lead to Magnitsky Act sanctions on the individuals involved. U.S. military aid and cooperation could be at risk.

Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Two years after being unjustly imprisoned in Turkey, the American pastor Andrew Brunson is coming home, thanks in no small part to President Trump. On Friday a Turkish court convicted Mr. Brunson on unsupported terrorism charges, yet sentenced him to time served. This leniency was purportedly for good behavior, but more likely a response to U.S. pressure. 'This is the day our family has been praying for,' Mr. Brunson said. 'My entire family thanks the President, the administration, and Congress for their unwavering support.'  Mr. Trump had repeatedly raised the evangelical pastor's detention with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. After that failed to produce results, the Treasury Department applied sanctions, under the Global Magnitsky Act, to the country's justice and interior ministers. As the lira went into free fall this summer, Mr. Trump announced he planned to double tariffs on Turkish aluminum and steel. This was a hard line to take with a NATO ally. But Mr. Brunson never should have been arrested. Swept up in 2016 after a failed Turkish coup, he was essentially Mr. Erdogan's hostage. The strongman suggested he would free the pastor if the U.S. handed over Fethullah Gulen, an imam in Pennsylvania whom Mr. Erdogan accuses, without credible evidence, of plotting the coup. Credit to the White House for knowing when to ease up. After showing his seriousness, Mr. Trump softened his tone as Friday's court date approached, giving Mr. Erdogan room to back down.  Now the task is patching up relations with Turkey. U.S. officials have said Mr. Erdogan is also unjustly holding NASA scientist Serkan Golge, as well as employees of America's diplomatic mission More[8] Pastor Brunson's Deed of Derring-Do[9] Hugh Fitzgerald Jihad Watch Oct 14, 2018  Pastor Andrew Brunson has now been released from house arrest in Turkey and returned to the United States, but the lessons of his captivity should not be forgotten. In the long saga of Recep Tayyip Erdogan's refusal to release Brunson, the pastor was held for months in a single cell along with 17 Muslim prisoners accused, as he was initially, of 'G\u00fclenism.' Then he was placed under house arrest. The sheer craziness of Turkey's polity under Erdogan was on display as never before in the Brunson case. In the vast dragnet Erdogan ordered in Turkey after the attempted coup of mid-July 2016, his government detained more than 100,000 Turks, and arrested almost 50,000 of them, accused of being followers of Fethulleh G\u00fclen. In October 2016, Brunson, a pastor of the Presbyterian Evangelical Church, who had lived in Turkey for 23 years, ministering quietly to a church of 25 congregants, was arrested for being a 'terrorist'   the terrorists in question apparently being the G\u00fclenists. Among the absurdities offered into evidence by the prosecution, court documents claimed that a photo of maqluba, a popular Levantine rice dish, was found on Brunson's phone, sent to him by his daughter. The court documents describe maqluba as a 'G\u00fclenist delicacy.' Brunson was in one charge accused of having attended a G\u00fclenist event. In another, it was claimed that he spoke positively once about relations between Christians and the G\u00fclenist movement. Brunson was charged with 'membership in an armed terrorist organization,' 'gathering state secrets for espionage, attempting to overthrow the Turkish parliament and government, and to change the constitutional order.' But even that was not enough. He was accused not just of being a G\u00fclenist   that iPhone picture of maqluba being a dead giveaway   but also accused of being a collaborator with armed Kurdish groups, of visiting the YPG (a Kurdish militia group that Erdogan describes as 'terrorist') territory in Syria, and of wanting to Christianize Kurdistan and have it become a Christian state. And even that was not all. Pastor Brunson was also accused in the indictment of being a 'high-level member of the G\u00fclen movement' as well as an American spy, positioned to become CIA chief in Turkey had the 2016 coup attempt succeeded. It was alleged that Brunson fended off an assassination attempt thanks to his intelligence agency training, and there was speculation in the press that the CIA would assassinate Brunson in prison if it thought he would not be deported back to the U.S. For he knew too many secrets. All of these charges were both idiotic and fantastical. Pastor Brunson was exactly what he seemed to be: a dedicated Christian, who had tended his tiny flock of 25 congregants for more than 20 years, and had never visited, much less plotted with, Kurds in Syria, had never attended a single G\u00fclenist meeting, and had no plans either to take over and balkanize Turkey, nor to 'Christianize Kurdistan.' Another absurdity came in an article by one Mehmet Erdogan, a deputy from the ruling party, who accused Brunson of having served in the American military in Iraq, where he was, as a Marine, in charge of stealing gold bullion from the Iraqis worth hundreds of billions. The proof? A photograph of an American soldier, supposedly looking like Pastor Brunson, with the military name-tag of 'Brownm' holding up what was described as a 'gold bar.' In truth, the soldier in question did not look anything like Andrew Brunson, except in his crew-cut. The name 'Brown' may, to a Turk or Arab, seem similar to 'Brunson' (BRN-BRN), but not to anyone else. And the 'gold bar' being held up could not possibly have been of gold, because if it were, it would weigh 300 pounds. The 'gold bar' in question was not the right size for conventional gold bars. It was, in fact, part of a cache found in a truck in Iraq in 2003 that had originally been estimated to be worth $500 million. According to a Reuters report from August 1, 2003, later testing of the more than 1,000 bars that were found revealed they were not gold, but mostly copper and zinc. Experts said they were melted-down shell casings. And the true content of the bars was made in a report to Congress about the reconstruction effort More[10] Voices of Reason and Unreason[11]: Susan Collins put on a clinic in thoroughness and justice. Democrats need to stand up to the screamers. Peggy Noonan The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  What did the Kavanaugh controversy tell us about our historical moment? It underscored what we already know, that America is politically and culturally divided and that activists and the two parties don't just disagree with but dislike and distrust each other. We know also the Supreme Court has come to be seen not only as a constitutional (and inevitably political) body but as a cultural body. It follows cultural currents, moods, assumptions. It has frequently brushed past the concept of democratic modesty to make decisions that would most peacefully be left to the people, at the ballot box, after national debate. So citizens will experience the court as having great power over their lives, and nominations to the court will inevitably draw passion. And this was a fifth conservative seat on a nine-person court.  But the Kavanaugh hearings had some new elements. There were no boundaries on inquiry, no bowing to the idea of a private self. Accusations were made about the wording of captions under yearbook photos. The Senate showed a decline in public standards of decorum. A significant number of senators no longer even pretend to have class or imitate fairness. The screaming from the first seconds of the first hearings, the coordinated interruptions, the insistent rudeness and accusatory tones none of it looked like the workings of the ordered democracy that has been the envy of the world.  Two Republican senators this week wrote to me with a sound of mourning. One found it 'amazing' and 'terrifying' that 'seemingly, and without very much thought, nearly half the United States Senate has abandoned the presumption of innocence in this country, all to achieve a political goal.' The other cited 'a truly disturbing result: One of the great political parties abandoning the Constitutionally-based traditions of due process and presumption of innocence.' At the very least, Senate Democrats overplayed their hand A word on the destructive theatrics we now see gripping parts of the Democratic Party. The howling and screeching that interrupted the hearings and the voting, the people who clawed on the door of the court, the ones who chased senators through the halls and screamed at them in elevators, who surrounded and harassed one at dinner with his wife, who disrupted and brought an air of chaos, who attempted to thwart democratic processes so that the people could not listen and make their judgments: Do you know how that sounded to normal people, Republican and Democratic and unaffiliated? It sounded demonic. It didn't sound like 'the resistance' or #MeToo. It sounded like the shrieking in the background of an old audiotape of an exorcism. Democratic leaders should stand up to the screamers. They haven't, because they're afraid of them. But things like this spread and deepen. Stand up to your base. It's leading you nowhere good. And you know it More[12] Democrats Sing, the ABA Dances[13]: Will the lawyers' guild try to delegitimize the new Court Justice? Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  Brett Kavanaugh has already heard his first Supreme Court oral arguments, but Democrats are signaling they'll continue a campaign to undermine his standing. Let's hope the American Bar Association doesn't become their partisan handmaiden. Paul Moxley, head of the ABA's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, wrote to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley in an Oct. 5 letter that the ABA committee is 'reopening' its 'evaluation' of Justice Kavanaugh. This is the same ABA committee that on August 30 gave the judge its highest rating in a report replete with praise. Now Mr. Moxley writes that this could change, given 'new information of a material nature regarding temperament during the September 27th hearing' in which Judge Kavanaugh defended himself against claims by Christine Blasey Ford. Mr. Moxley's letter landed more than a week after the Kavanaugh-Ford hearing, though on the eve of the crucial full Senate vote on Judge Kavanaugh. It followed a public demand by ABA President Robert Carlson a Hillary Clinton donor to further delay the Senate vote with an FBI probe. The vote proceeded after that probe, and now the only purpose of an ABA re-evaluation would be to join the Democratic political campaign to delegitimize the new Justice and the current Supreme Court. Mr. Moxley seems like a straight-shooter, but if he's being bullied by Mr. Carlson or Democrats on his committee, he ought to resign and say so publicly. Otherwise he should shut down this revisionist exercise More[14] 'You Cannot Be Civil'[15]: Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton agree on the current state of the Democratic party. Daniel Henninger The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  At a time when it's said that anything is possible in American politics, the impossible just happened. Hillary Clinton has aligned herself with Donald Trump's view of the Democratic Party.  Mr. Trump has been using his political rallies to denounce 'the radical Democrats' as 'an angry mob.' On Tuesday, Mrs. Clinton told CNN: 'You cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.' You cannot be civil. Behold the Trump sun and the Clinton moon in a moment of political eclipse.  It's hard to pick out exactly when in the past month the Democrats shifted the national focus away from Mr. Trump and onto their own behavior. I'd say it was the Senate's final vote Saturday on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation. Democrats had thrown everything at Judge Kavanaugh, and it was over. But not in the Senate gallery. On cue, literally, spectators started shrieking at the senators on the floor. Guards moved toward the chamber's doors, and the vote stopped while the screamers were removed.  During Ronald Reagan's presidency, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was Jeane Kirkpatrick, who in some ways was a template for Nikki Haley's U.N. tenure as an unapologetic defender of America's interests. At the Republicans' 1984 national convention, Kirkpatrick delivered a speech memorable for one phrase 'the San Francisco Democrats.' The idea behind 'the San Francisco Democrats' has never died. It stands for a party of the unelectable left. That year, Reagan defeated Walter Mondale by 525 to 13 electoral votes.  Democrats will complain it is beyond chutzpah for Donald Trump to brand them as divisive or radical after he has spent his presidency polarizing the electorate with his rhetoric and Twitter[16] account. Maybe, but that was then. Whatever else was at issue in the midterm elections, it has been overtaken by the Kavanaugh nomination, which transfixed the nation for weeks.  The Democrats were in OK shape through phase one of the Kavanaugh hearings, a sometimes intense back-and-forth about his judicial beliefs. But it was phase two the Christine Blasey Ford weeks, brought forth by Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Democratic Party activists that defined the battle lines for the November elections.  The hearings began as a familiar narrative Republicans are hostile to women. But that spun out of control into broader issues of fundamental fairness and due process. In conversations I've had recently with Democrats, once past the Kavanaugh arguments, most express a desire for more political civility. This is wishful thinking. The party has a problem: The San Francisco Democrats are back the Kavanaugh episode shows that the party is being taken over by what I would call the Code Pink Left.  The professional network of the Code Pink Left, typified by the George-Soros-funded woman who trapped Sen. Jeff Flake in an elevator, has virtually no interest in substantive policy goals. The Code Pink Left specializes in creating political story lines or 'frames' such as that conservatives are weak on sexual abuse which it promotes with theatrical protests, distributes on social media, and depends on mainstream media for constant repetition. This is something familiar. It is called agitprop. The goal is to make the broader electorate nervous and doubtful. It worked. Many voters are now nervous about the Democrats' street-fighting men and women. Every Republican from Trump down to dogcatcher is running against the Democrats' 'angry mob' of Senate screamers and restaurant marauders More[17] Patriot Prayer Rally for 'Law and Order' Faces Antifa Violence[18] Penny Starr Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 The streets of Portland, Oregon, became violent over the weekend as the right-wing Patriot Prayer group clashed with black-clad and masked Antifa as ongoing protests and counter-protests in the city often go unchecked by police. The violent clash on Saturday came after a protest on Friday was held following the death of Patrick Kimmons, whom police shot on September 30 after he allegedly shot two other men. At Friday's protest, a 74-year-old man drove through a crowd of protesters who responded by attacking the car and breaking a window. The incident was captured[19] on video. 'Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler came under fire over a viral video showing Antifa protesters blocking traffic and harassing drivers, but he says he supports the decision by police to watch from a distance without getting involved,' the Washington Times reported[20]. 'I was appalled by what I saw in the video, but I support the Portland Police Bureau's decision not to intervene,' Wheeler\u00a0said[21] at a Friday press conference. 'This whole incident will be investigated.' That's when Patriot Prayer organized what it billed as a 'law and order' rally[22] on Saturday to demand Portland police respond to such violence and called for Wheeler to resign. But when they arrived on Saturday, they were met by Antifa counter-protesters.\u00a0 Journalist Andy Ngo captured much of the clash between the two groups on video, which he tweeted as it unfolded 'The American Divide: One side chants, 'USA!' Masked side chants, 'black lives matter!'' Ngo tweeted 'And then it became a full-on brawl   with lots of pepper spray flying everywhere. I couldn't really see what I was recording until now. #Portland,' Ngo tweeted. 'The mayor has been accused of taking a kid-gloves approach to the protests that routinely roil the liberal enclave, such as the summer occupation of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement building, which saw Portland police refuse to assist unless federal officers were in physical danger,' the Times reported More[23] Alec Baldwin calls for 'overthrow' of Trump at Dem fundraiser in New Hampshire[24] Paul Steinhauser Fox News October 15, 2018 MANCHESTER, N.H. - Less than 24 hours after reprising his Emmy Award-winning parody of President Trump on 'Saturday Night Live,' Alec Baldwin took aim at the president again. 'In an orderly and formal way, and lawful way, we need to overthrow the government of the United States under Donald Trump,' Baldwin said Sunday night at a major fundraising dinner for New Hampshire's Democratic Party The video and more[25] Is 'First, Kill All the Lawyers' the Democrats' New Credo?[26] Their cries that the Supreme Court has been 'corrupted' evoke the rhetoric of totalitarians. George Melloan The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Democrats don't want to kill all the lawyersJust the ones associated with President Trump Dave In Shakespeare's 'Henry VI,' Jack Cade promises a coup that will make him king, after which 'all the realm shall be in common' with bounties for all. To which the murderous Dick the Butcher replies, 'The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.' This oft-quoted line has become a lawyer's joke, but Shakespeare no doubt also wanted to convey revolutionary zeal. If you destroy lawyers, you also do in the law. That would have suited Dick fine.  Fast forward to last Saturday, after Brett Kavanaugh concluded his own dramatic turn on the world stage by ascending to the Supreme Court. His Democratic tormentors, including California's 85-year-old Sen. Dianne Feinstein, don't want the drama to end. Up went the hue and cry that Justice Kavanaugh would 'taint' future Supreme Court decisions. The Atlantic's Adam Serwer didn't leave it at that, screaming that all three branches of government had been befouled by 'Trumpist corruption.' Maybe it's time for the Democrats to calm down. They probably aren't aware of it, since reading history has gone out of style, but their hatred of Donald Trump has now boiled over into what sounds like an attack on America's institutions. As the party of the left, they should be more careful about any such suggestion. Modern history records that it is the left, not the right, that has been more culpable in destroying institutions that protected citizens from authoritarian rule.  Mrs. Feinstein should know better. For someone in her position to suggest that Justice Kavanaugh's appointment 'undermines the legitimacy of the Supreme Court,' as she tweeted Saturday, is not quite equivalent to suggesting that we kill all the lawyers. But it does strike a blow against the sanctity of the judiciary. That is an offense more serious than the senator likely intended. It constitutes an attack on the rule of law an institution at the heart of the much admired and widely emulated success of the American experiment in self-government.  Other large nations have tried similar experiments, which too often have led to disastrous failures. It is often forgotten that the Russians attempted to make representative government work, electing their first State Duma, or parliament, in 1906 and making some progress over 11 years until the effort was shattered by revolution. Lenin said the Bolsheviks 'found power lying in the streets and simply picked it up.' We know how that turned out; the Russian people are still living with its legacy It is not a good omen when leaders of a major party and its adherents in the press seem to justify lawlessness simply because they don't like the president the country elected. In National Review Online last weekend, Andrew C. McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor, reviews recent warning signs of this turn to lawlessness. One example was the FBI's use in 2016 of a fake dossier manufactured by the Democrats as a reason to spy on the Trump campaign. Under the title 'The Left Criminalizes Politics By Weaponizing Investigations,' Mr. McCarthy writes of the Kavanaugh hearings: 'The world has changed. People who care nothing about norms can no longer be dismissed as a fringe. For generations, left-wing activists have instructed students and other groups that norms are the building blocks of a rigged system that deprives them of power and denies their 'selfless' desires We don't want to acknowledge what this has wrought. We have norms because they safeguard foundational principles, such as due process, the presumption of innocence, and freedom from unreasonable and unwarranted police prying. But the Left is no longer attached to those principles.' More[27] Rep. John Ratcliffe: Fusion GPS Founder Glenn Simpson 'in Real Legal Jeopardy'[28] Joshua Caplan Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Rep.

A partial transcript is as follows The video and more[29] Who Is Michael Sussmann?[30] The FBI's general counsel met with a Clinton lawyer in September 2016. Kimberley A. Strassel The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  When Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked about the origin of the infamous Trump dossier, James Comey brushed off most of the questions. The former Federal Bureau of Investigations director said someone on his 'senior staff' he couldn't remember who had 'briefed' him on the dossier 'sometime in the fall' of 2016. Mr. Comey had been told it came 'from a reliable source.' He insisted he 'never knew exactly which Democrats had funded' it. He then continued on about his book, which meditated on the importance of 'truth.' That interview, in April 2018, is relevant in light of a recent report from the Hill's John Solomon that James Baker, the FBI's general counsel from 2014-17, met 'weeks before the 2016 election' with a lawyer from Perkins Coie. That's the firm that hired Fusion GPS to compile the dossier on behalf of the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.  My sources confirm that the Perkins partner who bent Mr. Baker's ear and handed over documents was Michael Sussmann, point man for the firm's DNC and Clinton campaign accounts. They also confirm the subject of the meeting was Russian interference in the election, including hacking and supposed ties to Donald Trump. Much of this comes from an interview House investigators conducted last week with Mr. Baker.  The significance of this revelation is enormous for everything from FBI investigatory malpractice, to its dishonesty, to its current fight with the White House over document disclosure. That the FBI's general counsel was even meeting with a top lawyer for the Clinton campaign shortly before the election is proof of that the bureau strayed beyond obvious guardrails.  It's alarming enough that the FBI felt free to open a counterintelligence investigation into an active presidential campaign. That it also felt free to gather information for that probe from the opposing campaign is mind-boggling. Team Clinton had the most powerful position on earth to gain from Mr. Trump's downfall. No conflict there, right?  It is unclear whether Mr. Sussmann supplied any dossier-related information to Mr. Baker. But we know from the House Intelligence Committee's February Russia memo that 'senior DOJ and FBI officials' by this time knew the DNC and the Clinton campaign were behind the dossier. The Baker-Sussmann meeting raises the likelihood that those 'senior officials' extended into Mr. Comey's inner circle and that quite a few people understood the bureau was moving against a campaign based on the rival campaign's opposition research. Yet those officials marched into the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and never revealed in any of their warrant applications that the dossier was a product of the Clinton campaign. It now appears the FBI also didn't tell the court that its investigation had been informed directly by a lawyer for Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sussmann, as a former Justice Department employee, would presumably add credibility to any FISA application unless the FBI was worried about revealing how much it was relying on the Clinton camp. By the way, Mr. Baker told congressional investigators that he personally reviewed the initial FISA application. The news of this meeting also gives cause to doubt the FBI's stated reasons for refusing to release documents to Congress The Baker-Sussmann revelation underscores that we will never get the truth about the FBI's behavior until those documents are made public.

When asked if she really has a 'file on sexism in politics,' Clinton said, 'I do. I do. It's a file that tells a somewhat sobering story about how hard it is to break through the mindsets that people have. And it is difficult for many people, not just men, a lot of women, to think, wait a minute, this woman is going to be a governor or a member of Congress or my mayor or maybe even a president.'

When the Fever Passes, Learn From Trump's Taxes[35]: The tax code isn't just the rates but the loopholes and gray areas. Moving on to the next ploy Democrats are going to tryin their efforts to impeach President Trump Dave Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Last Saturday's column[36] on the New York Times investigation of Trump family tax dodging put aside the question of whether hefty inheritance taxes are good public policy. Let's take it up now. Those who complained that my nondefense 'normalized' Trump-era corruption miss an obvious fact. The events took place 30 years ago. It was already normalized. The Times itself has now run two [37]op-eds[38] making the same point. The appraiser who valued Trump property for tax purposes, according to the paper's investigation, was a 'favorite of New York City's big real-estate families.' Trump family lawyers and accountants were the same ones used by other real-estate developers. The family's returns were approved and accepted by the New York State Department of Taxation and the Internal Revenue Service. You might ask: If Times reporters can decide 30 years after the fact the Trumps didn't pay enough taxes, why didn't enforcement agencies decide so at the time? Trump projects were important to the city. The Trumps were big donors. Fred Trump (whose taxes we're mostly talking about) had been tight with Mayor Abe Beame. Trump advisers would have known to a fine degree what they could get away with because they'd been working the angles for many years on behalf of many clients. Beware of the Times's assumptions about the valuations morass. Not everything is required to be valued at market prices. There's a lesson here. The tax code isn't just the rates but the loopholes and gray areas. An intelligent person wonders why it's so full of features that work at cross-purposes. Unfortunately, a lot of people have an interest in a complicated tax system, politicians most of all. They want credit for soaking the rich, but they also want to be on friendly terms with their rich constituents, and they don't want the economic consequences of deterring work and investment More[39] Rutgers Postpones Alum's Speaking Appearance on Free Speech After Islamophobia Accusations[40]  Fox News Insider October 13, 2018 A Rutgers University alumna had her lecture on free speech postponed by the university after a petition by students began circulating, accusing her of Islamophobia.

Pro-life activist assaulted by abortion protester on campus[43] Unhinged Dave Caleb Parke Fox News October 13, 2018 Police are investigating an incident in Toronto caught on camera where an abortion protester attacked a female pro-life activist. Gabriela 'Gabby' Skwarko, a student at Ryerson University in Ontario who works for the school's Office of Social Innovation and is part of the Ryerson Reproductive Justice Collective, is seen in a video attacking two members of Toronto Against Abortion (TAA). 'I was shocked and terrified,' TAA Director Katie Somers\u00a0told Fox News. 'When I cried out in pain I kind of thought she would leave me alone but it seemed to make no difference to her.' Blaise Alleyne, president and founder of TAA, said Skwarko launched the attack out of nowhere as the anti-abortion group was getting to wrap up for the day. 'I don't like seeing my friends get beat up in the street,' Alleyne said. 'We're in the business of exposing violence to end it. We're shining a light on this deplorable behavior. Assaulting somebody for having a conversation is not acceptable. We want to expose it and end it.' Skwarko allegedly targeted Somers and Alleyne for their role in the pro-life group. She kicked over signs, fell on top of one, landing on Somers. Then she threw a metal cart at Somers and ran toward her, grabbed her backpack and reached in, took out her stainless steel water bottle, and\u00a0threw it on the ground. She shoved Somers and then bumped Alleyne in the chest. 'Let's go! C'mon,' Skwarko said, taunting the pro-life advocates. EMS and police were immediately called. The Toronto Police Service and the Ryerson Student Conduct Office are currently investigating the situation. Skwardo is temporarily forbidden from contacting Alleyene, who is a part-time student at Ryerson, and from going within 100 meters of him or any pro-life demonstration he is involved in. As a result of Skwarko's attack, Somers has taken time off work to heal, including an injury to her wrist and bruising down her right leg.

Like too many U.S. Army infantrymen who fell in World War I, he was buried in an American cemetery on European soil Today few remember the names of men who made the ultimate sacrifice. Their mothers knew that people often forget what they do not see. With that in mind, Gold Star mothers from Prince George's County, Md., sought to preserve some of these names. In 1919 they embarked on a mission to construct a concrete and bronze, cross-shaped memorial featuring the names of their sons, including Hartman.  In 1925, these mothers and the American Legion dedicated the Bladensburg World War I Veterans Memorial to the memory of these men. Martha Redman, who lost her son William F. Redman in World War I, explained that she considered the memorial to be her son's 'grave stone.' Yet after years of litigation, a three-judge panel of the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals determined this year that this memorial is unlawful. According to the court, the memorial's cross shape violates the Constitution. Chief Judge Roger Gregory dissented from the decision to deny a review of the case before the full Fourth Circuit. 'Nearly a century ago, Maryland citizens, out of deep respect and gratitude, took on the daunting task of erecting a monument to mirror the measure of individual devotion and sacrifice these heroes had so nobly advanced,' he wrote. 'The panel majority says their effort violates the Constitution the soldiers fought to defend. I, respectfully, think otherwise.' Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III also understood the importance of the memorial, writing in his dissent: 'The dead cannot speak for themselves. But may the living hear their silence.' Judge Paul V. Niemeyer, also dissenting, wrote that the Fourth Circuit's decision 'offends the monument's commemoration of those soldiers' sacrifice. Moreover, it puts at risk hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of similar monuments.'  A few miles from Bladensburg is Arlington National Cemetery. Unless the Supreme Court agrees to hear our appeal and overturns the Fourth Circuit's decision, the Canadian Cross of Sacrifice, the Argonne Cross, and perhaps the Tomb of the Unknowns itself originally a World War I veterans monument inscribed with language intertwining the poetic and religious could face desecration and demolition. That's only at Arlington. Within 40 miles of Bladensburg are similar monuments employing religious symbolism to commemorate lost soldiers. Countless others across the country share a similar design. There's a reason for that. Judge Niemeyer explained: 'The monument's use of the cross shape mirrors the custom in Europe during World War I.' He also correctly observed that the Fourth Circuit's decision 'will now have the monument removed or destroyed because, as it concludes, its presence on public land amounts to a violation of the Establishment Clause, although no Supreme Court case has ever held that the Establishment Clause prohibits such monuments.' Alvergia Guyton is the niece of John Henry Seaburn, a soldier who joined the segregated U.S. Army when he was 16. He fought with the African-American 372nd Infantry Regiment, 93rd Division of the French army during the war. Reflecting on the prospect that the memorial could be destroyed, she told a reporter, 'It's history, and people can't see it when they start tearing it down. You're robbing the next generation.' More[49] The Price of BernieCare[50]: Democrats object that Republicans are telling voters the truth about single payer. BernieCare sounds like the Cloward-Piven strategy[51] for bankrupting America Dave Editorial Board The Wall Street Journal Oct. 11, 2018  Chuck Schumer declared this week that health care is the issue that will define the November elections, and the Senate Minority Leader may be right for the wrong reason. Democrats could end up paying a big political price for signing up en masse for Bernie Sanders's government-run health-care agenda. Republicans are running ads slamming Democrats on single-payer health care, and President Trump framed the issue this week in a USA Today op-ed that said 'Democrats would gut Medicare with their planned government takeover of American health care.' Democrats claim this is unfair because not every candidate has endorsed single payer, but if they now want to repudiate it they should say so. Mr. Trump is referring to the Bernie Sanders bill known as Medicare for All, which has been endorsed by 16 Senators, including almost all of the left's leading 2020 presidential contenders (Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren).  A companion House bill has attracted more than 120 co-sponsors, which is nearly two-thirds of the current Democratic caucus. Other devotees include the Democratic nominees for Governor in California (Gavin Newsom) and Florida (Andrew Gillum) and dozens of other candidates around the country. Did Democrats think they could endorse this to please their progressive base but then have no one notice? Medicare for All would finance health care through taxes instead of insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays. All care would then be 'free' in the Venezuelan sense of the word. Government would dramatically cut the reimbursement rates doctors receive for providing services. All this would lower administrative costs and make health care more efficient, or so we're told. And we're not supposed to call this 'government-run health care,' though who do you think would make the payment decisions? Mr. Trump noted in his op-ed that the plan would cost the federal government $32.6 trillion over 10 years. That figure is from an analysis by the Mercatus Center's Charles Blahous, a respected researcher and a former Social Security and Medicare trustee who sometimes writes for us. His findings are in the ballpark of every serious analysis. That spending figure amounts to 10.7% of GDP in 2022 when the plan kicks in and then up from there. National defense routinely derided as too expensive and wasteful is a mere 3% of GDP today. And brace yourself: 'Doubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan,' Mr. Blahous says More[52] In 'The Good Censor,' Google Admitted to Censorship   And The Media Ignored It[53] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Earlier this week, Breitbart News released 'The Good Censor,'[54] an 85-page internal company presentation created by Google, explaining in frank terms that the handful of big tech companies that dominate the internet have 'shifted towards censorship.' The response from the establishment media? Virtually nothing. There were a couple notable exceptions.\u00a0The Daily Mail ran a detailed story[55] about the leak, as did The Hill. And The Verge, part of the far-left Vox Media empire, ran two stories on the leak - although they mostly defended Google's right to censor in the name of 'safety and security.' BuzzFeed's Charlie Warzel called the leaked presentation 'incredibly fascinating[56]' in a social media post, but BuzzFeed itself has thus far failed to cover it. The conservative media did much better, with coverage in The Western Journal, World Net Daily, LifeSite, Fox News, NewsBusters, and The Daily Wire. But most of the mainstream 'tech media' seems more interested in reviewing Google's latest smartphone[57] than the company's candid acknowledgment that the masters of the digital universe have largely abandoned the internet's founding principles of freedom and openness. Why the silence? Perhaps they buy Google's explanation that the presentation was just 'research' and doesn't reflect 'official Google positions'   a confusing explanation, as the research is\u00a0about\u00a0official\u00a0Google positions. Is Google disagreeing with its own researchers' assessment of where the company is headed? A more likely explanation for the media turning a blind eye to the presentation is that they basically agree with it, and find nothing uncontroversial about its declaration that tech companies have abandoned the 'American tradition' of free speech in favor of the 'European tradition' of protecting everyone's feelings. Here's how The Verge puts it: 'Almost all of us would agree that some restrictions on free speech are necessary. But few of us would agree on what those restrictions should be. Being a good censor   or at least, a more consistent censor   is within Google's grasp. But being a politically neutral one is probably impossible.' According to the author of the piece, censorship is difficult in practice but still good in theory. What's more, being a 'good censor' is 'within Google's grasp'   even if that censorship isn't politically neutral. Harvard's Nieman Lab, a purportedly respectable institution of establishment journalism, didn't just ignore The Good Censor   it praised it. Nieman Lab's piece was gushing[58] in its assessment of the presentation, calling it 'insightful and interesting,' going so far as to suggest that Google should have voluntarily made it public. Why the praise? A clue is in the list of bullet points the Nieman Lab author uses to summarize The Good Censor: at the very top is Google's distinction between 'authoritative sources' and 'have-a-go commentators.' Google bemonas that in an environment of total free speech, the opinions of ordinary people can compete with sources like\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0on an even playing field. It's easy to see why the Nieman Lab, a pillar of establishment journalism, would applaud this assessment More[59] 80 Percent Of Americans Think Political Correctness Is A National Problem[60]  Contrary to a common narrative, majorities of Americans of all ages, income levels, and racial backgrounds strongly oppose political correctness.  Don't let the PC bunch intimidate youIt is time for the 'silent majority' to stand up to these guilt-flinging bullies Dave Joy Pullmann The Federalist October 12, 2018 Eighty percent of Americans say\u00a0'political correctness is a problem in our country,' according to newly released data from a nationally representative poll drawing upon 8,000 survey respondents, 30 one-hour interviews, and six focus group. Some of this data, compiled with help from YouGov, has been newly released in a report called 'Hidden Tribes[61].' Objections to political correctness are even stronger among racial minorities and those who have never attended college. High-income college graduates, especially those with advanced degrees, are the Americans most likely to think political correctness is not a problem. These are also the group most likely to label themselves atheists or agnostics, and identify as politically liberal. Contrary to a common cultural narrative, the poll finds large majorities of Americans of all ages, income levels, and racial backgrounds oppose political correctness, even while 82 percent also think 'hate speech' is a problem. This may suggest Americans believe thought and speech censorship is not the best way to address rude and discriminatory behavior. Opposition to political correctness was higher among Asians (82 percent), Hispanics (87 percent), and American Indians (88 percent) than among white Americans (79 percent). In fact, just about every single demographic studied showed overwhelming objection to political correctness except the Americans the study reporting the poll results identified as 'progressive activists.'\u00a0Progressive activists, the study says, 'have an outsized role\u00a0in political discourse, even though they comprise\u00a0a small portion of the total population (about 1 in\u00a012 Americans).' About the 8 Percent of People Love PC 'Progressive activists are the only group that strongly backs political correctness: Only 30 percent see it as a problem,' wrote Harvard University lecturer Yascha Mounk in an overview of the poll results[62] at The Atlantic More[63] The Scourge of 'Diversity'[64]: A onetime liberal, Heather Mac Donald now believes identity politics threatens higher education and civilization itself. Jillian Kay Melchior The Wall Street Journal Oct. 12, 2018  Heather Mac Donald may be best known for braving angry collegiate mobs, determined to prevent her from speaking last year in defense of law enforcement In her new book, 'The Diversity Delusion,' Ms. Mac Donald, 61, explores how identity politics has diverted higher education from more elevated subjects. She warns of this ideology's spread to other cultural institutions and industries Hollywood, Silicon Valley, Wall Street She thinks conservatives miss the point when they focus on the due-process infirmities of campus sexual-misconduct tribunals. She doesn't believe there's a campus 'rape epidemic,' only a lot of messy, regrettable and mutually degrading hookups. 'To say the solution to all of this is simply more lawyering up is ridiculous because this is really, fundamentally, about sexual norms.' Society once assumed 'no' was women's default response to sexual propositions. 'That put power in the hands of females,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'You didn't have to bargain every time you didn't want to have sex. The male had to bargain you into yes. But you could say no, and you didn't have to exhaust yourself.' Sexual liberationists claimed men and women were alike, and chivalry and feminine modesty were oppressive. 'Now, the default for premarital sex is yes,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'That gives enormous power to the male libido' at the expense of women. The #MeToo movement is one reflection of this reality, but so is the growing realization that consensual sex isn't always healthy sex When it comes to race She argues that minorities could overcome economic and educational disparities by embracing 'bourgeois values.' She opposes all forms of affirmative action, and believes admissions and hiring should be based solely on aptitude tests and objective measures of performance Even when disadvantaged students truly have shown exceptional work ethic, unless their test scores pass muster, 'I think the mismatch is far too powerful a problem.' That refers to the theory that preferences set up their intended beneficiaries for failure. They're suddenly expected to perform beyond their proven capabilities and to compete with peers who earned admission through merit. This helps explain why universities may feel racially hostile despite the best efforts of admissions officers, faculty and administrators. Minority students may be excluded from study groups or chosen last for class projects because of aptitude, not race. 'That's heartbreaking,' Ms. Mac Donald says, 'but if you come to a university with one or two standard deviations below your peers of academic qualifications, the gap doesn't close.'  So without affirmative action, how can kids born into poverty and dysfunction ever escape their circumstances? Ms. Mac Donald questions the premise: 'What I also find striking about the defenses of racial preferences is the extraordinary snobbery and elitism on the part of the most selective schools the assumption is that unless you go to Harvard or UC Berkeley, life is over for you,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'To escape poverty, you just need to graduate from high school, hold a job any job, minimum-wage job, full-time and wait until you get married to have children. Nearly three-fourths of all people who follow those simple rules are not poor.' Some conservatives attempt to match the hyperbole and theatrics of campus progressives. That isn't Ms. Mac Donald's approach 'to see me as a 'provocateur' is kind of ridiculous,' she adds.  Leftist mobs don't make that distinction. As Ms. Mac Donald recalls the night in April 2017 when she needed a police escort and spoke to an empty hall at Claremont McKenna College, she stiffens, crosses her arms, and speaks softly. The shades were pulled down at a guest suite-turned-safe house, she recalls, and the crowd outside grew louder and louder, chanting and wailing and drumming. 'I don't want to sound melodramatic about this, because I was obviously not at huge risk of any physical danger,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'But I did feel somewhat of an understanding of what the victims of the French Revolution felt, in waiting for the guillotine. Because you hear a mob that is, in fact, hysterical. And you don't know what's going to happen next.' What worries Ms. Mac Donald more than the mob is the destructive power of its animating ideas. If the university continues its decline, how will knowledge be passed on to the next generation, or new knowledge created? Ms. Mac Donald also warns of a rising white identity politics 'an absolutely logical next step in the metastasizing of identity politics.' 'One of the great achievements of Western European civilization was to move beyond tribalism, to nation-states, to concepts of citizenship that transcend tribal identity,' Ms. Mac Donald says. 'And we've been playing with fire for the last 40 years in thinking we can keep this ethnic warfare thing at a low simmer rather than a hot boil.'

Since February,\u00a0Breitbart News\u00a0has reported[70] how the Trump administration is set to\u00a0enforce[71]\u00a0an existing law whereby foreign nationals seeking to permanently resettle in the U.S. would need to prove that they will not become drains on the American taxpayer. Such a plan would be a boon for American taxpayers, who currently spend[72] about\u00a0$57.4 billion\u00a0a year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low-skilled legal immigrants every year. In the last decade, the U.S. has imported[73] more than\u00a010 million foreign\u00a0nationals and is on track to import the same amount in the coming decade if legal immigration controls are not implemented.

Venezuelan Socialist Leader on Suspect Opposition Leader's Death: Respect Choice of Suicide[78] Ahhhh The joys of Socialism Dave Ben Kew Breitbart News 14 Oct 2018 Leading Venezuelan socialist Diosdado Cabello declared[79] on Thursday that people 'must respect' the decision of an opposition lawmaker to commit suicide, despite no evidence suggesting he chose to kill himself. Fernando Alb\u00e1n, a local councilman from Caracas, died[80] in police custody on Monday shortly after returning from New York. According to\u00a0Venezuelan officials, Alb\u00e1n threw himself from the tenth floor of Secret Police (Sebin) headquarters after being interrogated by officials. Officials offered conflicting stories on whether Alb\u00e1n chose to jump from the main officers of the building or asked to go to the restroom and then took the alleged plunge. 'They say he could not have killed himself because he was a Catholic. Isn't there proof that there are Catholics priests with children? Where does it say they can do that? It's absurd,' Cabello said on his state television show\u00a0Con El Mazo Dando ('Hitting with the Mallet'). 'He took the decision and we have to respect that because it is the life of a human being.' Authorities arrested Alb\u00e1n at Caracas airport last Friday\u00a0who claimed they had evidence\u00a0linking[81]\u00a0Alb\u00e1n to a failed drone\u00a0assassination attempt on Maduro at a military event the capital in August. The country's attorney general William Tarek Saab claimed that Alb\u00e1n requested to use a bathroom on the tenth floor of the Sebin facility and jumped out of the bathroom window to his death. Opposition and foreign governments rejected this explanation and accused officials of torturing and murdering the politician. A spokeswoman for the U.N. rights office, Ravina Shamdasani, told reporters[82] that the Maduro regime had 'an obligation to ensure (Alban's) safety, personal integrity, and dignity We are concerned about news of his death We do indeed call for a transparent investigation to clarify the circumstances of his death.' More[83] China Acknowledges Re-Education Centers for Uighurs[84] Beijing had previously denied it was detaining members of the ethnic minority in centers, a campaign that has sparked an international outcry Eva Dou The Wall Street Journal Oct. 10, 2018  BEIJING China has retroactively changed the law to legitimize its detention of hundreds of thousands of Muslim Uighurs in a campaign that has sparked an international outcry over human rights abuses against the ethnic minority. The amended counterterrorism regulations, adopted Tuesday in the northwest Xinjiang region where most Uighurs live, say that authorities can use 'vocational skills training centers' to 'deradicalize' people suspected of extremism. The previous rules made no reference to vocational centers. The new rules appear to mark the first time China has acknowledged its use of vocational centers to detain Xinjiang residents for 'transformation through education.' Senior Chinese officials have maintained including before a United Nations panel[85] in August that the centers taught vocational skills to petty criminals. It had disputed reports the centers were used for 'political re-education.' The new regulations 'establish a much more direct link between re-education and vocational skills training,' said Adrian Zenz, a researcher on the Xinjiang camps at the European School of Culture and Theology in Germany. Criticism is growing over China's mass detention of Uighurs. A U.S. Congressional report[86] released on Wednesday warned of a 'dire human rights situation' in China, particularly the country's mass internment of Uighurs and other minorities. The U.N. panel in August found that Uighurs were being held for extended periods without charge or trial 'under the pretext of countering terrorism and religious extremism.'

They started complaining 'They're separating him from his family' and chanting 'take him off the plane' in rowdy scenes[89] recorded by several people on their mobile phones. Rather than throw off the disruptive passengers or have them arrested for obstructing the course of justice, however, officials buckled to the mutinous flyers and took Ahmed off the flight, while his supporters applauded and shouted: 'You're free, man!'

In a release called 'Myth vs. Fact: Caravan,' the department also states more than 270 people in the caravans are either known gang members or have criminal backgrounds 'We continue to be concerned about individuals along the caravan route. In fact, over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership,' the statement[2] said. </p><p>'Those include a number of violent criminals - examples include aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, sexual assault on a child, and assault on a female.'  A DHS spokesperson told the Washington Examiner the 270 had previously been convicted, not just charged. 'We also continue to see individuals from over 20 countries in this flow from countries such as Somalia, India, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. There is a large segment of this population that we know nothing about and we must be prepared to defend our border and enforce our laws to protect the citizens of our country,' the department said.  Officials put the number of people in the two caravans from Central American countries at 6,500 total. Both caravans are making their way north through Mexico.  Last week, President Trump stated 'unknown Middle Easterners' were among migrants in a caravan[3] fleeing Central America for the U.S. DHS had defended[4] Trump's claim but not shared details of who was in the group until now.  Mexican officials have previously said known criminals were a part of the caravan. 'I have videos from Guatemala that show men dressed in identical clothing, sporting the same haircuts, handing out money to women to persuade them to move to the front of the caravan,' Mexican Interior Minister Navarrete Prida said[5] Tuesday during a radio interview. 'We know, for a fact, that some members of the caravan threatened [Mexican] Migration Institute personnel and we have images showing many of them preparing Molotov cocktails.'  DHS estimates put half of the group as single adults. A senior Border Patrol official based in San Diego, Calif., recently told[6] the Washington Examiner only 20 to 30 percent of the first caravan were children and families More[7] Why Are People Fleeing Central America? A New Breed of Gangs Is Taking Over.[8] Gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 prey on their own neighborhoods in a violent, chaotic model spreading through the region  Robbie Whelan The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  APOPA, El Salvador\u2014The Congress of El Salvador agreed in April to extend the authority of jailers to keep gang leaders in solitary confinement. Over the next five days, the two reigning street gangs killed more than 100 people. With the highest homicide rate of all countries in the world, El Salvador is a nation held hostage. Law-enforcement officials estimate that one gang, MS-13[9], operates an extortion racket with little pressure from authorities in 248 of the 262 of the country's municipalities. It battles for neighborhood control with another gang, Barrio 18, which runs its own protection scheme in nearly as many regions. Politicians must ask permission of gangs to hold rallies or canvass in many neighborhoods, law-enforcement officials and prosecutors said. In San Salvador, the nation's capital, gangs control the local distribution of consumer products, experts said, including diapers and Coca-Cola[10] . They extort commuters, call-center employees, and restaurant and store owners. In the rural east, gangs threaten to burn sugar plantations unless farmers pay up. They have grown so pervasive that 'you don't know where the state ends and the criminal organizations begin,' said Mauricio Ramrez Landaverde, El Salvador's minister of justice and security, who oversees the national police force More[11] Border Patrol Apprehends Central American Migrant Group near Texas Border[12] Bob Price Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Border Patrol agents in the Laredo Sector arrested a group of Central American migrants after receiving a call for assistance from local police officers. Border Patrol agents assigned to the Laredo South Station received a call from the Laredo Police Departments regarding a possible group of illegal aliens they encounter in a home near Slaughter Park. The agents responded to the location in south Laredo and found ten migrants who were detained by the local police, according to information obtained by Breitbart News from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials. The agents conducted an immigration interview with the ten migrants and learned they were all illegally present in the U.S. The agents identified the migrants as having traveled to the U.S. from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, officials stated. Slaughter Park is located on Laredo's south side just north of the Rio Grande River that separates Laredo, Texas, from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Border Patrol officials previously told Breitbart News that this is an area known for illegal border crossing activity. During Fiscal Year 2018, Laredo Sector agents apprehended a total of 32,641 illegal aliens who crossed the border between ports of entry, according to the year-end Southwest Border Migration Report. This represents the third largest number of apprehensions of the nine southwestern border sectors. Of those 32,641 migrants, 2,879 were unaccompanied minors and 597 were Family Unit Aliens, officials reported More[13] $145M Texas border wall project awarded, Customs and Border Protection says[14] Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News November 3, 2018 A $145 million construction project was awarded Wednesday to build roughly six miles of border wall in Texas, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced on Friday. The agency, in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers, gave the multimillion-dollar job in the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector to SLSCO, CBP said in a news release[15]. Work on the project, also known by CBP as RGV-03, is expected to kick off in February, the agency said. Among the anticipated work is the building and set up 'of tactical infrastructure,' which includes 'a reinforced concrete levee wall to the height of the existing levee, 18 feet tall steel bollards installed on top of the concrete wall, and vegetation removal along a 150 foot enforcement zone throughout the approximately six miles of levee wall system,' the news release said. The area will also be equipped with detection technology and video surveillance, the agency said. The Rio Grande Valley Sectorhas 'high illegal cross border activity,' according to CBP. 'Once constructed, this levee wall system will serve as a persistent impediment to transnational criminal organizations, while still allowing river access for property owners, other federal/state/local officials, local emergency responders, and USBP,' the agency said. 'CBP continues to implement President Trump's Executive Order 13767 \u2014 also known as Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements \u2014 and continues to take steps to expeditiously plan, design, and construct a physical wall using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,' the agency continued More[16] Suspect in Vandalism Attack on New York Synagogue Is Democrat Activist[17] Joel B. Pollak Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Police said James Polite, 26, was caught on surveillance video vandalizing a Brooklyn synagogue with anti-Semitic graffiti on Thursday.(NYPD[18]) James Polite, the 26-year-old man who was arrested Friday for allegedly vandalizing a synagogue in Brooklyn Thursday, is a Democratic activist who once worked for New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, and also volunteered for Barack Obama. TheNew York Times reported[19] Saturday: 'Mr. Polite was arrested on Friday and charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime for writing 'Die Jew Rats,' 'Hitler,' 'End It Now' and 'Jew Better Be Ready' in marker on walls of the Union Temple of Brooklyn. The police said surveillance video captured Mr. Polite, of Brooklyn, inside the synagogue. He was taken into custody on Friday morning at the scene of a fire that had been set inside the coat room of Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg, officials said. Mr. Polite was charged with arson, reckless endangerment and criminal mischief \u2014 all as hate crimes \u2014 for setting fires at four other locations affiliated with the Jewish community, including another school. The police recognized Mr. Polite from the surveillance video at Union Temple.' The synagogue had been scheduled to host a Democratic Party event. The Daily Caller notes[20] that Democrats, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, had used the vandalism in political messages \u2014 until the arrest.

Feeling a need to clear his conscience following last week's synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh, and in the midst of his own legal troubles, President Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in a recent interview that he recalled several instances in which his former boss used racist and anti-gay language during one-on-one conversations. In the interview with Vanity Fair[35], Cohen said he wanted to express himself in the wake of a tragedy in which 11 people were gunned down during Saturday services, and looking ahead toTuesday's election, which he called 'the most important vote in our lifetime.' According to Cohen, during a discussion at Trump Tower after returning from a 2016 campaign rally, Cohen observed that the rallycrowd was overwhelmingly white when he watched it on television. 'I told Trump that the rally looked vanilla on television,' Cohen said. 'Trump responded, 'That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me.'' A few years earlier, after Nelson Mandela's death, Trump allegedly said to Cohen: ''Name one country run by a black person that's not a s\u2014hole,' and then he added, 'Name one city,'' The alleged exchange mirrors comments attributed to Trump earlier this year about some African nations[36]and other developing countries. Cohen also said he recalled a conversation with Trump when they were traveling through a Chicago neighborhood. 'We were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood,' Cohen told the magazine. 'Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this.'

Many journalists blamed President Trump for everything going wrong, but didn't give him credit for the good economy or any of his other accomplishments. In the past week, the president was depicted as a 'white nationalist' whipping up 'xenophobia' and promoting 'the divisive issue of immigration.'[39] (Notice how immigration is only divisive when you expect people to obey laws.) Journalistic extremism was easy to find. 'Hate is on the Ballot,'[40] warned New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, claiming the GOP 'has increasingly become the party of right-wing extremists.' He followed that up by claiming that 'good people can't be good Republicans.'[41] Civility and all that. Appearing on MSNBC, New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay complained about the 'reality' that Trump is a 'white nationalist president who is a threat to American democracy.' The Times wants voters to 'put country over party' by doing what the Times always wants voters to do - go left. Gay's fellow panelists on MSNBC agreed and went to even greater extremes. Bloomberg Opinion Editor Tim O'Brien[42] repeated Gay's critique, adding that the president 'has been a bigot and a white nationalist for a long time.' Trump even 'kept a book of Hitler's speeches on the nightstand by his bed,' according to O'Brien. Over at CNN, Chris Cuomo[43] blamed Republicans for a 'campaign message' of 'fear and loathing.' He went on to blast President Trump for depicting the immigrant caravans as 'an invading force filled with dealers and murderers' so the president can 'whip up as much xenophobia and conflict as he can.' Cuomo summed it up as a 'midterm hate campaign.' That sounds suspiciously like a description of MSNBC 'Morning Joe' co-host Mika Brzezinski's rant [44]about the president. Here's just one line: 'The rhetoric of this racist, heartless, soulless man will lead to more violence.' It all fit a theme - scaring the voters about President Trump and Republican candidates up for election.

It is open season on Trump supporters, and the media is only fomenting, encouraging, excusing, and hoping for more The media are now openly calling Trump supporters 'Nazis[52]' and are blaming[53] Trump for a mass murder hehad nothing to do with. This, of course, is a form of harassment because it incites and justifies mob violence. Here is the list, so far, and remember that if any one of these things happened to a Democrat, the media would use the story to blot out the sun for weeks. Remember how crazy the media went over a nobody rodeo clown[54]who wore an Obama mask, a GOP staffer[55] who criticized Obama's daughters? And yet, hundreds of Trump supporters are harassed and brutalized and the media only dutifully report them, if at all. That is because the media are desperate to normalize and justify violence and harassment against Trump and his supporters. And while the media openly encourage this violence against us, the media also campaign to disarm us, to take away our Second Amendment right to defend ourselves. This list will be updated as needed. Back-filling it will be an ongoing project Here is a video channel[56]dedicated to documenting the dozens and dozens of assaults against Trump supporters.

On his Real America with Jorge Ramos show on Facebook Watch this week, the Univision anchor asked Ocasio-Cortez whether she wanted to impeach Trump once she got to Congress. 'I mean, yeah. To me, it's a no-brainer,' Ocasio-Cortez replied[70] to Ramos. 'Well, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it's the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. Whether it's what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence.' Ocasio-Cortez also said impeaching Trump should not be 'beyond the pale' because of how Republicans impeached former President Bill Clinton for lying under oath. 'But overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,' she added. Though Ocasio-Cortez said she believes Trump should be impeached because he committed a crime, other Democrats like Rep. Al Green (D-TX) have insisted[71] that Trump 'does not have to commit a crime to be impeached.' In fact, Green has argued that Trump could be impeached simply for 'harming society.' More[72] Maxine Waters Vows Retribution if Dems Take House[73] Trent Baker Breitbart News 2 Nov 2018 Waters told the attendees how 'important' the upcoming midterm election is. '[W]e have an election November 6,' Waters said. 'This is big. This may be the most important one that you've ever had to experience. This is the midterm election and, often times, people only vote in the presidential election because they don't think this is important enough. But this is absolutely important.' She then listed off what would happen when she became Financial Services Committee chairwoman. 'First of all, if we take back the House, most of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus will be chairs of the committees of the Congress of the United States of America,' Waters told the group.I will be the first African-American, the first woman to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee. That's all of Wall Street. That's all the insurance companies, that's all the banks. And so, of course, the CEOs of the banks now are saying, 'What can we do to stop Maxine Waters? Because if she gets in, she's going to give us a bad time.'' She continued,'I have not forgotten you foreclosed on our houses. I have not forgotten that you undermined our communities. I have not forgotten that you sold us those exotic products, had us sign on the dotted line for junk, and for mess that we could not afford. And in doing that, I have people who are homeless who have never gotten back into a home. What am I going to do to you? What I am going to do to you is fair. I'm going to do to you what you did to us.' Waters' comments were met with applause and agreement More[74] Democrats' midterm election fight and the one major takeaway[75] Kimberley A. Strassel The Wall Street Journal November 3, 2018 Nancy Pelosi appears very confident that her party will win back control of the House. In a few days the U.S. will have its midterm results, and the Beltway press corps will lecture us on the lessons. Don't expect to hear much about the one takeaway that is already obvious: that today's preferred progressive politics \u2014 of character assassination, mob rule, intimidation and wacky policies \u2014 is an electoral bust. It is not what is winning Democrats anything. It is what is losing the party the bigger prize. Six weeks ago, Democrats were expecting a blue wave to rival the Republican victory of 2010, when the GOP picked up 63 House seats. Everything was in their favor. History \u2014 the party in power almost always loses seats. Money \u2014 Democrats continue to outraise Republicans by staggering amounts. The opposition \u2014 some 41 GOP House members retired, most from vulnerable districts where Donald Trump's favorability is low. Democrats were even positioned to take over the Senate, despite defending 10 Trump-state seats. Democrats obliterated their own breaker in the space of two weeks with the ambush of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The left, its protesters and its media allies demonstrated some of the vilest political tactics ever seen in Washington, with no regard for who or what they damaged or destroyed along the way \u2014 Christine Blasey Ford, committee rules, civility, Justice Kavanaugh himself, the Constitution. An uncharacteristically disgusted Sen. Lindsey Graham railed: 'Boy, y'all want power. God, I hope you never get it!' A lot of voters suddenly agreed with that sentiment. The enormous enthusiasm gap closed almost overnight as conservative voters rallied to #JobsNotMobs. Even liberal prognosticators today forecast that Republicans will keep the Senate and Democrats will manage only a narrow majority in the House, if that. It's always possible the polls are off, or that there is a last-minute bombshell. But it remains the case that the ascendant progressive movement blew an easy victory for Democrats More[76] 'No evidence' to back Kavanaugh accusers' claims, Senate panel's report on FBI probe finds[77] Louis Casiano Fox News November 4, 2018 An investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by multiple women found that no witnesses could provide evidence to substantiate their claims, a letter[78] to Senate Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said Friday. According to the 414-page report released by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, investigators interviewed more than 40 people, monitored social media and news reports and reviewed evidence provided by the judge and his accusers. 'Following the separate and extensive investigations by both the Committee and the FBI, there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh,' the report states The sexual misconduct allegations came during the committee's hearings to decide whether Kavanaugh, whom President Trump nominated in July to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, would be confirmed. Kavanaugh's nomination set off a battle between Republicans, most of whom defended the judge, and Democrats, who pushed for a large-scale investigation into the women's allegations. Among those questioned, the report said, were Mark Judge, PJ Smyth, and Leland Keyser, the three individuals whom accuser Christine Blasey Ford claimed were present in the house when Kavanaugh allegedly threw her on a bed and sexually assaulted her sometime in the 1980s. Grassley last month requested that the FBI investigate accuser Julie Swetnick and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels in her allegations against President Trump. Swetnick's credibility was questioned[79] after an ex-boyfriend told Fox News that 'she exaggerated everything' and threatened to kill his unborn child.  Investigators found no evidence to support either woman's claims. Swetnick also made several contradictory statements about her claims during television interviews and refused to speak with committee investigators, the letter said. 'Indeed, the evidence appears to support the position that Julie Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee's investigation.'

Michael Avenatti has spent what he calls a 'sizable' amount of money on the ad, which targets the national divide on President Donald Trump's administration. 'We the people,' a host of different faces say to the camera, 'are mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.' The ad's beginning recalls the famous speech from the 1976 movie Network, then immediately shifts into its modern rhetoric. In true modern political ad fashion, lines are spoken by a montage of different people. 'Enough with the lies,' one intones. 'Enough with the bigotry,' says another. 'If you put big money first and us second, your time is done.' Avenatti closes the ad facing the camera: 'Our constitution says 'We the people, not 'Me the president.' Stand up. Join the fight club. Use your vote as your voice on Nov. 6.' More[84] Before Jane Fonda Called Trump Hitler, She Called Jim Jones a Hero[85] Daniel J. Flynn Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Jane Fonda compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler at the Women's Media Awards on Thursday. 'If you've read anything about the rise of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, you will see the parallels,' Fonda maintained. 'Attacking the media is the first step in the move towards fascism.' Fonda, given her wild misjudgment of the only American to systematically murder scores of his fellow countrymen in an actual concentration camp, strikes as the wrong messenger bearing the wrong message here. Before Jane Fonda saw Donald Trump as Adolf Hitler, she saw Jim Jones as a hero. 'We are familiar with the work of Reverend Jones and Peoples Temple,' Fonda, along with husband Tom Hayden, San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk, reporter Paul Avery, California assemblyman Willie Brown, and other progressives, avowed in 1977, 'and have no hesitancy in commending them for their example in setting a high standard of ethics and morality in the community and also for providing enormous material assistance to poor, minority and disadvantaged people in every area of human need.' Fonda denied joining Peoples Temple. She did attend a Temple service. In researching Cult City: Jim Jones, Harvey Milk, and 10 Days That Shook San Francisco[86], Jane Fonda's name came up repeatedly, albeit no less shockingly each time, as a devoted supporter of Jim Jones. And other researchers uncovered a particularly damning letter sent after her visit to Peoples Temple: 'I also recommit myself to your congregation as an active full participant\u2014not only for myself, but because I want my two children to have the experience.' More[87] If Gun Control Is So Popular, Why Are Democrats Avoiding It?[88] Awr Hawkins Breitbart News 2 Nov 2018 Democrats have spent years telling us Americans want more gun control yet now, four days before midterm elections, there are no candidates for federal office making gun control the central plank of their campaign. In fact, Senate candidates like Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and incumbents like Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), are fighting to hide their gun control support from constituents. On October 29, 2018, Breitbart News reported[89] undercover Project Veritas videos in which Sinema's admitted the numerous gun controls supported by the candidate but also made clear that Sinema could not discuss those controls until the election was over. We saw the same thing with McCaskill, whose staff praised her ability[90] to hide her gun control support until after Missourians have all cast their votes. Once the election is over everything changes, and a McCaskill field organizer described the Senator's openness to a 'semiautomatic rifle ban.' More[91] The Stakes in 2018 \u2014 Tyranny by Silicon Valley and Far-Left Corporations[92] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Imagine living in a world where a few executives in Silicon Valley, along with a couple of credit card companies, get to control what you say, who you interact with, what causes you can support, whose products you can buy and whether you can run a business. Political domination by Silicon Valley and progressive corporations likely outcome if Republican voters don't turn out in sufficient numbers this Tuesday. America has already caught a glimpse of the coming corporate dystopia. Over the past two years, we've seen a massive, largely unchecked assault on Americans' ability to enjoy their constitutional freedoms, led by unaccountable CEOs and relentlessly encouraged by Democrats and the establishment media. The most striking example of this undemocratic collusion between political factions and corporations was the mass-ban of Alex Jones and Infowars. Love him or loathe him, Jones was the most censored man in media this year, facing permanent bans from Apple podcasts, Apple's App Store, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Mailchimp, and even Pinterest. The mass purge followed weeks of lobbying by CNN[93] for Silicon Valley to take action. Other conservative figures who have been blacklisted by big tech this year include CRTV host Gavin McInnes (on both Twitter[94] and Facebook[95]), Islam critic Tommy Robinson[96], Republican organizer R.C. Maxwell[97], and former adviser to President Nixon, Roger Stone[98]. Meanwhile, far-left extremists like the notorious racist and recent New York Times hire Sarah Jeong are given privileged treatment by social media companies. Despite engaging in hate speech that would get a conservative banned in minutes, Jeong was verified by Twitter[99], guaranteeing that her tweets will be promoted in the influential platform's algorithm.

People with knowledge of the work of Saud al-Qahtani say he was intimately involved in the kingdom's targeting of Mr. Khashoggi\u2014from efforts to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia from the U.S., to the planning and execution of the operation that ended with his death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. He is under criminal investigation, these people say, and has been fired from his job as the crown prince's media adviser. The alleged role of Mr. Qahtani in the murder is complicating Saudi Arabia's efforts to separate its de facto leader, Prince Mohammed[105], from a killing that has triggered a diplomatic crisis[106] for the kingdom and caused deep angst among the country's rulers[107].  'Whether or not he knew about it,' a Western official said of the crown prince, 'this happened under his watch.' The Saudi government has repeatedly denied [108]that Prince Mohammed had any direct knowledge of the operation, despite persistent suspicions by Turkish and Western officials that he must have known about it. The prince condemned the killing as a 'hideous incident' and vowed to deliver justice. This account of Mr. Qahtani's role in the targeting of Mr. Khashoggi and other dissidents is based on interviews with members of the Saudi royal family, government advisers, Western officials, activists and other people familiar with Mr. Qahtani and his work. The 40-year-old, though nominally the prince's media adviser, was effectively Prince Mohammed's right-hand man, with extensive sway over domestic and foreign affairs, people familiar with the matter said. The crown prince last year also put Mr. Qahtani in charge of an effort to repatriate dissidents, some of these people said.  One of Mr. Qahtani's first targets was Mr. Khashoggi, a onetime insider[109] turned government critic whose stinging tweets and Washington Post columns irritated the royal court. At first, Mr. Qahtani used flattery in the name of his boss to lure him back. 'The Crown Prince values your role as an editor,' the messenger, Mr. Qahtani, told Mr. Khashoggi on WhatsApp, a friend of the journalist said. 'He wants you back in Saudi Arabia.' When the journalist refused to return to the kingdom from the U.S., the Saudi government banned his son Salah from leaving. 'I cannot believe you are stooping so low, and that even family members are being targeted now,' Mr. Khashoggi told Mr. Qahtani after he learned of the travel ban on Salah, a friend of the journalist familiar with the message exchange on WhatsApp said. Mr. Qahtani never replied. The Saudi government lifted the travel ban [110]last week. When Mr. Khashoggi entered the consulate in Istanbul for a scheduled meeting on Oct. 2, 18 operatives dispatched from Riyadh were waiting for him. The consular official who scheduled the meeting had been in touch with Mr. Qahtani, two people familiar with the matter said. Another trusted aide of Prince Mohammed assembled the team of operatives: Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri[111], the deputy chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence, who had worked closely with Mr. Qahtani in a previous role as a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen. Gen. Assiri received the order to assemble and dispatch the team to Istanbul from Mr. Qahtani, several people familiar with the matter said. 'Saud al-Qahtani gave the impression that what he said was what MBS wanted,' a person familiar with the investigation said, using the acronym by which Prince Mohammed is also known More[112]  As New Iran Sanctions Loom, U.S. Aims to Plug Gaps[113]: Trump administration's plan to block Iranian oil exports begins Monday, as it grants waivers allowing eight countries to temporarily import Iranian oil  Ian Talley and Courtney McBride The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  The Trump administration moved Friday toward its goal of maximum economic pressure against Iran, while granting waivers allowing eight countries to temporarily import Iranian oil without facing U.S. punishment. The waivers, to countries that government advisers say include China, Turkey and India, are designed to give them time to switch to other suppliers while sharply reducing or eliminating their purchases of Iranian oil over time. But with the U.S. economic pressure campaign coming into full force at 12:01 a.m. eastern time Monday, American officials also struggled to plug the holes that have plagued past sanctions plans against Iran. Unlike the global support for the Obama administration's penalties, broad opposition to the current U.S. policy, including from European allies, is sure to complicate the task. And Iran has pledged to resist the sanctions. Still, the Trump administration is off to a strong start: Iranian oil exports have fallen by more than a million barrels a day since the White House launched its new campaign in May. That decline represents more than a third of international sales. Iran's economy, with oil accounting for 80% of tax revenue, is in pain. Europe's largest companies have pulled out, and Iranian consumers rushed to exchange their rials, pushing the currency's value to record lows and sparking a surge in consumer prices. In March, the International Monetary Fund forecast Iran's economy would expand by 4% in 2018. Now it predicts a two-year recession, with a 3.6% contraction next year. 'We have seen a dramatic reduction in oil imports by Iran's top importers, a collapse in foreign direct investment, capital flight and banks deciding the cost-benefit analysis of doing business in Iran is simply not there,' said Brian Hook, who heads the State Department's new Iran Action Group, in an interview. The Trump administration's strategy to harden sanctions began with its decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear pact, which triggered the reimposition of many sanctions while giving the U.S. leeway on how leniently or forcefully to apply economic pressure. An executive order issued by President Trump set Nov. 5 as the day the oil sanctions resume.  They prohibit purchases of Iranian oil, with companies facing sanctions unless the State Department grants waivers to their home countries. U.S. officials didn't name the countries receiving waivers on Friday. The government advisers said China, India and Turkey along with South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Iraq are likely to receive waivers More[114] Trump Digs In for a Long, Cold War With Iran[115]: Latest sanctions aim to 'force' a regime determined to resist Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Nov. 4, 2018  President Trump has put Iran on notice that the punishing sanctions he plans to impose on Monday are just the opening salvo of an ambitious strategy to compel Tehran to pull back from its assertive posture in the Middle East or risk collapse. 'Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster,' Mr. Trump said in a statement Friday night. The guiding assumption behind the administration's policy is that Iran is economically weak, has little interest in a military confrontation with the U.S.\u2014and that Washington can force changes in decadeslong Iranian behavior that will reconfigure the Middle East, officials and experts say.  But senior Iranian officials insist Tehran will neither retrench nor negotiate. Former U.S. officials with long experience say Tehran has cards to play, including trying to ride out the sanctions in the hope that Mr. Trump is a one-term president and taking advantage of the continued turmoil in the region to stir up fresh challenges for the U.S. and its allies. 'Iran is gaining ground in the region, and I don't see these sanctions as reversing that,' said Jeffrey Feltman, who was the top State Department official on Middle East issues from 2009 to 2012 and later served as a United Nations undersecretary general for political affairs. An early test of the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign will come in Syria. The White House has sought Russian President Vladimir Putin's help in prodding Iranian forces and the Shiite militias[116] Tehran backs to leave the country\u2014so far, without success. Administration officials are now calculating that draconian economic measures[117] can prompt Iran to declare its military mission accomplished in Syria and bring its forces home. To drive home the point, U.S. officials have released figures asserting that Iran's annual tab for sustaining its Lebanese ally Hezbollah is about $700 million, while Tehran has spent at least $16 billion in recent years supporting its allies in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. More[118] Iranians rally to mark anniversary of US Embassy takeover[119] Associated Press November 4, 2018 Thousands of Iranians rallied in Tehran on Sunday to mark the 39th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover, as Washington restored all sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal. The crowd chanted 'Down with U.S.' and 'Death to Israel' during the rally in the capital, and state TV said similar demonstrations were held in other cities and towns. Iranian students stormed the embassy shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. cut off diplomatic relations in response. Iran's clerically-led government celebrates the embassy takeover every year as a decisive blow against the United States, which had supported the autocratic rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The embassy compound, widely known as the 'den of spies,' is now a cultural center. Anger and distrust of the United States is surging again following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers despite Tehran's compliance with the agreement, which was negotiated under the Obama administration. On Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored. Iran is already in the grip of an economic crisis, and has seen sporadic protests in recent months as Iranian officials have tried to downplay the sanctions and their effects More[120] Islamic attack against Coptic Christians pilgrims kills at least 7 in Egypt[121] Associated Press November 3, 2018 CAIRO - Islamic militants on Friday ambushed two buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, killing seven and wounding up to 16, according to the Interior Ministry and security officials. Coptic Orthodox Church spokesman Boulos Halim said the death toll was likely to rise. Local church officials in Minya province where the attack took place put the death toll at 10, but the higher figure could not be confirmed. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of Islamic militants who have for years been fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula and along Egypt's porous desert border with Libya. The extremist Islamic State group has repeatedly stated its intention to target Egypt's Christians as punishment for their support of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who, as defense minister, led the military's 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. El-Sissi wrote on his Twitter account that Friday's attack was designed to harm the 'nation's solid fabric' and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. Friday's attack is the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. It is also the latest in a deadly string of attacks that targeted churches in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and Tanta in the Nile Delta north of the capital. Those attacks, all claimed by the Islamic State group, left at least a 100 people dead and led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and other Church-linked facilities. The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, and the security officials said Friday's attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year's attack.  The security officials said the attackers opened fire on the two buses carrying pilgrims from Bani Suef and Sohag provinces, also south of Cairo. The Sohag bus had 28 pilgrims, of whom 9 were wounded, including two in serious condition. The Bani Suef bus carried 14 passengers, of whom seven were killed and the rest seriously wounded The Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene. Egypt's Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country's 100 million people, complain of discrimination in the Muslim majority country. Christian activists say the church's alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection but failed to end frequent acts of discrimination that boils over into violence against Christians, especially in rural Egypt More[122] Egypt Arrests Human-Rights Lawyers as Crackdown on Critics Intensifies[123]: The detentions are striking because of their scale and the prominence of those arrested  Democracy does not work in the Islamic worldEven their best leaders are repressive dictators These rulers have no choiceThe precepts of Islam are hostile to the very concept of man-made lawwhich it views to be in opposition to Islam's Allah-given Sharia law Dave Jared Malsin The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  CAIRO\u2014Egyptian security forces arrested at least 19 human-rights lawyers and activists this week in raids that reflect the country's security state is widening its assault on government critics[124] in an attempt to eliminate any challenge to President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.[125] Even against the backdrop of years of government repression, this week's arrests were striking because of the large number of people held and the detention of prominent human-rights lawyers  'It's a vicious attack,' said Aida Seif El Dawla, founder of a center working with victims of torture by Egyptian police. 'Every day, every second day there is a group of people who are arrested.' Mr. Sisi came to power in a military coup in 2013, in which he led the overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi[126] of the Muslim Brotherhood. Following the coup, the state set in motion a lethal crackdown on Islamists, in which more than a thousand died and tens of thousands were arrested. In the following years, the government widened its target to include non-Islamist political opponents, human-rights groups, independent news organizations, and anyone critical of the new military-backed government. The Egyptian government has defended its actions against critics, stating that the moves are intended to restore stability and security to the country following years of political unrest and violence following the 2011 revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak from the presidency.

In a release called 'Myth vs. Fact: Caravan,' the department also states more than 270 people in the caravans are either known gang members or have criminal backgrounds 'We continue to be concerned about individuals along the caravan route. In fact, over 270 individuals along the caravan route have criminal histories, including known gang membership,' the statement[2] said. </p><p>'Those include a number of violent criminals - examples include aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, sexual assault on a child, and assault on a female.'  A DHS spokesperson told the Washington Examiner the 270 had previously been convicted, not just charged. 'We also continue to see individuals from over 20 countries in this flow from countries such as Somalia, India, Haiti, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. There is a large segment of this population that we know nothing about and we must be prepared to defend our border and enforce our laws to protect the citizens of our country,' the department said.  Officials put the number of people in the two caravans from Central American countries at 6,500 total. Both caravans are making their way north through Mexico.  Last week, President Trump stated 'unknown Middle Easterners' were among migrants in a caravan[3] fleeing Central America for the U.S. DHS had defended[4] Trump's claim but not shared details of who was in the group until now.  Mexican officials have previously said known criminals were a part of the caravan. 'I have videos from Guatemala that show men dressed in identical clothing, sporting the same haircuts, handing out money to women to persuade them to move to the front of the caravan,' Mexican Interior Minister Navarrete Prida said[5] Tuesday during a radio interview. 'We know, for a fact, that some members of the caravan threatened [Mexican] Migration Institute personnel and we have images showing many of them preparing Molotov cocktails.'  DHS estimates put half of the group as single adults. A senior Border Patrol official based in San Diego, Calif., recently told[6] the Washington Examiner only 20 to 30 percent of the first caravan were children and families More[7] Why Are People Fleeing Central America? A New Breed of Gangs Is Taking Over.[8] Gangs such as MS-13 and Barrio 18 prey on their own neighborhoods in a violent, chaotic model spreading through the region  Robbie Whelan The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  APOPA, El Salvador The Congress of El Salvador agreed in April to extend the authority of jailers to keep gang leaders in solitary confinement. Over the next five days, the two reigning street gangs killed more than 100 people. With the highest homicide rate of all countries in the world, El Salvador is a nation held hostage. Law-enforcement officials estimate that one gang, MS-13[9], operates an extortion racket with little pressure from authorities in 248 of the 262 of the country's municipalities. It battles for neighborhood control with another gang, Barrio 18, which runs its own protection scheme in nearly as many regions. Politicians must ask permission of gangs to hold rallies or canvass in many neighborhoods, law-enforcement officials and prosecutors said. In San Salvador, the nation's capital, gangs control the local distribution of consumer products, experts said, including diapers and Coca-Cola[10] . They extort commuters, call-center employees, and restaurant and store owners. In the rural east, gangs threaten to burn sugar plantations unless farmers pay up. They have grown so pervasive that 'you don't know where the state ends and the criminal organizations begin,' said Mauricio Ramrez Landaverde, El Salvador's minister of justice and security, who oversees the national police force More[11] Border Patrol Apprehends Central American Migrant Group near Texas Border[12] Bob Price Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Border Patrol agents in the Laredo Sector arrested a group of Central American migrants after receiving a call for assistance from local police officers. Border Patrol agents assigned to the Laredo South Station received a call from the Laredo Police Departments regarding a possible group of illegal aliens they encounter in a home near Slaughter Park. The agents responded to the location in south Laredo and found ten migrants who were detained by the local police, according to information obtained by Breitbart News from Laredo Sector Border Patrol officials. The agents conducted an immigration interview with the ten migrants and learned they were all illegally present in the U.S. The agents identified the migrants as having traveled to the U.S. from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, officials stated. Slaughter Park is located on Laredo's south side just north of the Rio Grande River that separates Laredo, Texas, from Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. Border Patrol officials previously told Breitbart News that this is an area known for illegal border crossing activity. During Fiscal Year 2018, Laredo Sector agents apprehended a total of 32,641 illegal aliens who crossed the border between ports of entry, according to the year-end Southwest Border Migration Report. This represents the third largest number of apprehensions of the nine southwestern border sectors. Of those 32,641 migrants, 2,879 were unaccompanied minors and 597 were Family Unit Aliens, officials reported More[13] $145M Texas border wall project awarded, Customs and Border Protection says[14] Elizabeth Zwirz Fox News November 3, 2018 A $145 million construction project was awarded Wednesday to build roughly six miles of border wall in Texas, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced on Friday. The agency, in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers, gave the multimillion-dollar job in the Border Patrol's Rio Grande Valley Sector to SLSCO, CBP said in a news release[15]. Work on the project, also known by CBP as RGV-03, is expected to kick off in February, the agency said. Among the anticipated work is the building and set up 'of tactical infrastructure,' which includes 'a reinforced concrete levee wall to the height of the existing levee, 18 feet tall steel bollards installed on top of the concrete wall, and vegetation removal along a 150 foot enforcement zone throughout the approximately six miles of levee wall system,' the news release said. The area will also be equipped with detection technology and video surveillance, the agency said. The Rio Grande Valley Sectorhas 'high illegal cross border activity,' according to CBP. 'Once constructed, this levee wall system will serve as a persistent impediment to transnational criminal organizations, while still allowing river access for property owners, other federal/state/local officials, local emergency responders, and USBP,' the agency said. 'CBP continues to implement President Trump's Executive Order 13767   also known as Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements   and continues to take steps to expeditiously plan, design, and construct a physical wall using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border,' the agency continued More[16] Suspect in Vandalism Attack on New York Synagogue Is Democrat Activist[17] Joel B. Pollak Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Police said James Polite, 26, was caught on surveillance video vandalizing a Brooklyn synagogue with anti-Semitic graffiti on Thursday.(NYPD[18]) James Polite, the 26-year-old man who was arrested Friday for allegedly vandalizing a synagogue in Brooklyn Thursday, is a Democratic activist who once worked for New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, and also volunteered for Barack Obama. TheNew York Times reported[19] Saturday: 'Mr. Polite was arrested on Friday and charged with criminal mischief as a hate crime for writing 'Die Jew Rats,' 'Hitler,' 'End It Now' and 'Jew Better Be Ready' in marker on walls of the Union Temple of Brooklyn. The police said surveillance video captured Mr. Polite, of Brooklyn, inside the synagogue. He was taken into custody on Friday morning at the scene of a fire that had been set inside the coat room of Yeshiva Beth Hillel of Williamsburg, officials said. Mr. Polite was charged with arson, reckless endangerment and criminal mischief   all as hate crimes   for setting fires at four other locations affiliated with the Jewish community, including another school. The police recognized Mr. Polite from the surveillance video at Union Temple.' The synagogue had been scheduled to host a Democratic Party event. The Daily Caller notes[20] that Democrats, including New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, had used the vandalism in political messages   until the arrest.

Feeling a need to clear his conscience following last week's synagogue massacre in Pittsburgh, and in the midst of his own legal troubles, President Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen said in a recent interview that he recalled several instances in which his former boss used racist and anti-gay language during one-on-one conversations. In the interview with Vanity Fair[35], Cohen said he wanted to express himself in the wake of a tragedy in which 11 people were gunned down during Saturday services, and looking ahead toTuesday's election, which he called 'the most important vote in our lifetime.' According to Cohen, during a discussion at Trump Tower after returning from a 2016 campaign rally, Cohen observed that the rallycrowd was overwhelmingly white when he watched it on television. 'I told Trump that the rally looked vanilla on television,' Cohen said. 'Trump responded, 'That's because black people are too stupid to vote for me.'' A few years earlier, after Nelson Mandela's death, Trump allegedly said to Cohen: ''Name one country run by a black person that's not a s hole,' and then he added, 'Name one city,'' The alleged exchange mirrors comments attributed to Trump earlier this year about some African nations[36]and other developing countries. Cohen also said he recalled a conversation with Trump when they were traveling through a Chicago neighborhood. 'We were going from the airport to the hotel, and we drove through what looked like a rougher neighborhood,' Cohen told the magazine. 'Trump made a comment to me, saying that only the blacks could live like this.' During the first season of 'The Apprentice,' white contestant Bill Rancic and black Harvard-educated investment banker Kwame Jacksonwent head-to-head. 'There's no way I can let this black f- win,' Cohen recalled Trump explaining about why he couldn't pick Jackson, with Trump allegedly using a homophobic slur More[37] Media continue demonizing Trump, blaming him for motivating violent attackers[38] Dan Gainor Fox News November 4, 2018 Celebrities, spin and vicious attacks on President Trump and Republicans made for a predictable week in the anti-Trump media as Tuesday's midterm elections approach. Many journalists blamed President Trump for everything going wrong, but didn't give him credit for the good economy or any of his other accomplishments. In the past week, the president was depicted as a 'white nationalist' whipping up 'xenophobia' and promoting 'the divisive issue of immigration.'[39] (Notice how immigration is only divisive when you expect people to obey laws.) Journalistic extremism was easy to find. 'Hate is on the Ballot,'[40] warned New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, claiming the GOP 'has increasingly become the party of right-wing extremists.' He followed that up by claiming that 'good people can't be good Republicans.'[41] Civility and all that. Appearing on MSNBC, New York Times editorial board member Mara Gay complained about the 'reality' that Trump is a 'white nationalist president who is a threat to American democracy.' The Times wants voters to 'put country over party' by doing what the Times always wants voters to do - go left. Gay's fellow panelists on MSNBC agreed and went to even greater extremes. Bloomberg Opinion Editor Tim O'Brien[42] repeated Gay's critique, adding that the president 'has been a bigot and a white nationalist for a long time.' Trump even 'kept a book of Hitler's speeches on the nightstand by his bed,' according to O'Brien. Over at CNN, Chris Cuomo[43] blamed Republicans for a 'campaign message' of 'fear and loathing.' He went on to blast President Trump for depicting the immigrant caravans as 'an invading force filled with dealers and murderers' so the president can 'whip up as much xenophobia and conflict as he can.' Cuomo summed it up as a 'midterm hate campaign.' That sounds suspiciously like a description of MSNBC 'Morning Joe' co-host Mika Brzezinski's rant [44]about the president. Here's just one line: 'The rhetoric of this racist, heartless, soulless man will lead to more violence.' It all fit a theme - scaring the voters about President Trump and Republican candidates up for election.

It is open season on Trump supporters, and the media is only fomenting, encouraging, excusing, and hoping for more The media are now openly calling Trump supporters 'Nazis[52]' and are blaming[53] Trump for a mass murder hehad nothing to do with. This, of course, is a form of harassment because it incites and justifies mob violence. Here is the list, so far, and remember that if any one of these things happened to a Democrat, the media would use the story to blot out the sun for weeks. Remember how crazy the media went over a nobody rodeo clown[54]who wore an Obama mask, a GOP staffer[55] who criticized Obama's daughters? And yet, hundreds of Trump supporters are harassed and brutalized and the media only dutifully report them, if at all. That is because the media are desperate to normalize and justify violence and harassment against Trump and his supporters. And while the media openly encourage this violence against us, the media also campaign to disarm us, to take away our Second Amendment right to defend ourselves. This list will be updated as needed.

On his Real America with Jorge Ramos show on Facebook Watch this week, the Univision anchor asked Ocasio-Cortez whether she wanted to impeach Trump once she got to Congress. 'I mean, yeah. To me, it's a no-brainer,' Ocasio-Cortez replied[70] to Ramos. 'Well, I believe that he has violated the law. Violated potentially many laws, whether it's the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because he keeps his businesses open that foreign actors kind of participate in financial transactions with. Whether it's what we are seeing with potentially illegal buyouts of campaign, you know, FEC violations of women that he is trying to silence.' Ocasio-Cortez also said impeaching Trump should not be 'beyond the pale' because of how Republicans impeached former President Bill Clinton for lying under oath. 'But overall, you look at the bar that the Republicans held for impeaching Bill Clinton and somehow impeaching Donald Trump is supposed to be beyond the pale? It seems ridiculous to me,' she added. Though Ocasio-Cortez said she believes Trump should be impeached because he committed a crime, other Democrats like Rep. Al Green (D-TX) have insisted[71] that Trump 'does not have to commit a crime to be impeached.' In fact, Green has argued that Trump could be impeached simply for 'harming society.'

'[W]e have an election November 6,' Waters said. 'This is big. This may be the most important one that you've ever had to experience. This is the midterm election and, often times, people only vote in the presidential election because they don't think this is important enough. But this is absolutely important.' She then listed off what would happen when she became Financial Services Committee chairwoman. 'First of all, if we take back the House, most of the members of the Congressional Black Caucus will be chairs of the committees of the Congress of the United States of America,' Waters told the group.I will be the first African-American, the first woman to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee. That's all of Wall Street. That's all the insurance companies, that's all the banks. And so, of course, the CEOs of the banks now are saying, 'What can we do to stop Maxine Waters? Because if she gets in, she's going to give us a bad time.'' She continued,'I have not forgotten you foreclosed on our houses. I have not forgotten that you undermined our communities. I have not forgotten that you sold us those exotic products, had us sign on the dotted line for junk, and for mess that we could not afford. And in doing that, I have people who are homeless who have never gotten back into a home. What am I going to do to you? What I am going to do to you is fair.

Strassel The Wall Street Journal November 3, 2018 Nancy Pelosi appears very confident that her party will win back control of the House. In a few days the U.S. will have its midterm results, and the Beltway press corps will lecture us on the lessons. Don't expect to hear much about the one takeaway that is already obvious: that today's preferred progressive politics   of character assassination, mob rule, intimidation and wacky policies   is an electoral bust. It is not what is winning Democrats anything. It is what is losing the party the bigger prize. Six weeks ago, Democrats were expecting a blue wave to rival the Republican victory of 2010, when the GOP picked up 63 House seats. Everything was in their favor. History   the party in power almost always loses seats. Money   Democrats continue to outraise Republicans by staggering amounts. The opposition   some 41 GOP House members retired, most from vulnerable districts where Donald Trump's favorability is low. Democrats were even positioned to take over the Senate, despite defending 10 Trump-state seats. Democrats obliterated their own breaker in the space of two weeks with the ambush of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. The left, its protesters and its media allies demonstrated some of the vilest political tactics ever seen in Washington, with no regard for who or what they damaged or destroyed along the way   Christine Blasey Ford, committee rules, civility, Justice Kavanaugh himself, the Constitution. An uncharacteristically disgusted Sen. Lindsey Graham railed: 'Boy, y'all want power. God, I hope you never get it!' A lot of voters suddenly agreed with that sentiment. The enormous enthusiasm gap closed almost overnight as conservative voters rallied to #JobsNotMobs. Even liberal prognosticators today forecast that Republicans will keep the Senate and Democrats will manage only a narrow majority in the House, if that. It's always possible the polls are off, or that there is a last-minute bombshell. But it remains the case that the ascendant progressive movement blew an easy victory for Democrats More[76] 'No evidence' to back Kavanaugh accusers' claims, Senate panel's report on FBI probe finds[77] Louis Casiano Fox News November 4, 2018 An investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh by multiple women found that no witnesses could provide evidence to substantiate their claims, a letter[78] to Senate Republicans from the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman said Friday. According to the 414-page report released by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, investigators interviewed more than 40 people, monitored social media and news reports and reviewed evidence provided by the judge and his accusers. 'Following the separate and extensive investigations by both the Committee and the FBI, there was no evidence to substantiate any of the claims of sexual assault made against Justice Kavanaugh,' the report states The sexual misconduct allegations came during the committee's hearings to decide whether Kavanaugh, whom President Trump nominated in July to succeed retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy, would be confirmed. Kavanaugh's nomination set off a battle between Republicans, most of whom defended the judge, and Democrats, who pushed for a large-scale investigation into the women's allegations. Among those questioned, the report said, were Mark Judge, PJ Smyth, and Leland Keyser, the three individuals whom accuser Christine Blasey Ford claimed were present in the house when Kavanaugh allegedly threw her on a bed and sexually assaulted her sometime in the 1980s. Grassley last month requested that the FBI investigate accuser Julie Swetnick and her attorney, Michael Avenatti, who also represents porn star Stormy Daniels in her allegations against President Trump. Swetnick's credibility was questioned[79] after an ex-boyfriend told Fox News that 'she exaggerated everything' and threatened to kill his unborn child.  Investigators found no evidence to support either woman's claims. Swetnick also made several contradictory statements about her claims during television interviews and refused to speak with committee investigators, the letter said. 'Indeed, the evidence appears to support the position that Julie Swetnick and Mr. Avenatti criminally conspired to make materially false statements to the Committee and obstruct the Committee's investigation.'

Michael Avenatti has spent what he calls a 'sizable' amount of money on the ad, which targets the national divide on President Donald Trump's administration. 'We the people,' a host of different faces say to the camera, 'are mad as hell and we're not going to take it anymore.' The ad's beginning recalls the famous speech from the 1976 movie Network, then immediately shifts into its modern rhetoric. In true modern political ad fashion, lines are spoken by a montage of different people. 'Enough with the lies,' one intones. 'Enough with the bigotry,' says another. 'If you put big money first and us second, your time is done.' Avenatti closes the ad facing the camera: 'Our constitution says 'We the people, not 'Me the president.' Stand up. Join the fight club.

Flynn Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Jane Fonda compared Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler at the Women's Media Awards on Thursday. 'If you've read anything about the rise of the Third Reich and Adolf Hitler, you will see the parallels,' Fonda maintained. 'Attacking the media is the first step in the move towards fascism.' Fonda, given her wild misjudgment of the only American to systematically murder scores of his fellow countrymen in an actual concentration camp, strikes as the wrong messenger bearing the wrong message here. Before Jane Fonda saw Donald Trump as Adolf Hitler, she saw Jim Jones as a hero. 'We are familiar with the work of Reverend Jones and Peoples Temple,' Fonda, along with husband Tom Hayden, San Francisco supervisor Harvey Milk, reporter Paul Avery, California assemblyman Willie Brown, and other progressives, avowed in 1977, 'and have no hesitancy in commending them for their example in setting a high standard of ethics and morality in the community and also for providing enormous material assistance to poor, minority and disadvantaged people in every area of human need.' Fonda denied joining Peoples Temple. She did attend a Temple service. In researching Cult City: Jim Jones, Harvey Milk, and 10 Days That Shook San Francisco[86], Jane Fonda's name came up repeatedly, albeit no less shockingly each time, as a devoted supporter of Jim Jones. And other researchers uncovered a particularly damning letter sent after her visit to Peoples Temple: 'I also recommit myself to your congregation as an active full participant not only for myself, but because I want my two children to have the experience.' More[87] If Gun Control Is So Popular, Why Are Democrats Avoiding It?[88] Awr Hawkins Breitbart News 2 Nov 2018 Democrats have spent years telling us Americans want more gun control yet now, four days before midterm elections, there are no candidates for federal office making gun control the central plank of their campaign. In fact, Senate candidates like Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) and incumbents like Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-MO), are fighting to hide their gun control support from constituents. On October 29, 2018, Breitbart News reported[89] undercover Project Veritas videos in which Sinema's admitted the numerous gun controls supported by the candidate but also made clear that Sinema could not discuss those controls until the election was over. We saw the same thing with McCaskill, whose staff praised her ability[90] to hide her gun control support until after Missourians have all cast their votes. Once the election is over everything changes, and a McCaskill field organizer described the Senator's openness to a 'semiautomatic rifle ban.' More[91] The Stakes in 2018   Tyranny by Silicon Valley and Far-Left Corporations[92] Allum Bokhari Breitbart News 3 Nov 2018 Imagine living in a world where a few executives in Silicon Valley, along with a couple of credit card companies, get to control what you say, who you interact with, what causes you can support, whose products you can buy and whether you can run a business. Political domination by Silicon Valley and progressive corporations likely outcome if Republican voters don't turn out in sufficient numbers this Tuesday. America has already caught a glimpse of the coming corporate dystopia. Over the past two years, we've seen a massive, largely unchecked assault on Americans' ability to enjoy their constitutional freedoms, led by unaccountable CEOs and relentlessly encouraged by Democrats and the establishment media. The most striking example of this undemocratic collusion between political factions and corporations was the mass-ban of Alex Jones and Infowars. Love him or loathe him, Jones was the most censored man in media this year, facing permanent bans from Apple podcasts, Apple's App Store, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Spotify, LinkedIn, Vimeo, Mailchimp, and even Pinterest. The mass purge followed weeks of lobbying by CNN[93] for Silicon Valley to take action. Other conservative figures who have been blacklisted by big tech this year include CRTV host Gavin McInnes (on both Twitter[94] and Facebook[95]), Islam critic Tommy Robinson[96], Republican organizer R.C. Maxwell[97], and former adviser to President Nixon, Roger Stone[98]. Meanwhile, far-left extremists like the notorious racist and recent New York Times hire Sarah Jeong are given privileged treatment by social media companies. Despite engaging in hate speech that would get a conservative banned in minutes, Jeong was verified by Twitter[99], guaranteeing that her tweets will be promoted in the influential platform's algorithm. Also verified  Sleeping Giants,[100] a group whose sole purpose is to spread misinformation and slander about conservative news publications to their advertisers. Social media companies don't have to ban any kind of lawful speech. They could easily devolve that power to users[101] via opt-in filters. But even as the platforms have become modern public squares   essential arenas for Americans to exercise their First Amendment rights   they have developed a ceaselessly expanding list of rules, regulations, and prohibitions on lawful speech  More[102] Behind Saudi Prince's Crackdown Was Confidant Tied to Khashoggi Killing[103]: Media adviser gave the order to assemble the group that killed journalist, complicating kingdom's efforts to separate Prince Mohammed from hit job  The man behind the murder plot was MBS's closest confidant, Saud al-QahtaniTo earn that level of trust, we can be sure al-Qahtani did only as he was told It is not credible that MBS didn't know about the plan to kill Khashoggi Dave Margherita Stancati and Summer Said The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pushed through ambitious social reforms, he also ordered a zero-tolerance campaign against dissent spearheaded by his most trusted confidant, who is now implicated in the murder of journalist [104]Jamal Khashoggi. People with knowledge of the work of Saud al-Qahtani say he was intimately involved in the kingdom's targeting of Mr. Khashoggi from efforts to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia from the U.S., to the planning and execution of the operation that ended with his death in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. He is under criminal investigation, these people say, and has been fired from his job as the crown prince's media adviser. The alleged role of Mr. Qahtani in the murder is complicating Saudi Arabia's efforts to separate its de facto leader, Prince Mohammed[105], from a killing that has triggered a diplomatic crisis[106] for the kingdom and caused deep angst among the country's rulers[107].  'Whether or not he knew about it,' a Western official said of the crown prince, 'this happened under his watch.' The Saudi government has repeatedly denied [108]that Prince Mohammed had any direct knowledge of the operation, despite persistent suspicions by Turkish and Western officials that he must have known about it. The prince condemned the killing as a 'hideous incident' and vowed to deliver justice. This account of Mr. Qahtani's role in the targeting of Mr. Khashoggi and other dissidents is based on interviews with members of the Saudi royal family, government advisers, Western officials, activists and other people familiar with Mr. Qahtani and his work. The 40-year-old, though nominally the prince's media adviser, was effectively Prince Mohammed's right-hand man, with extensive sway over domestic and foreign affairs, people familiar with the matter said. The crown prince last year also put Mr. Qahtani in charge of an effort to repatriate dissidents, some of these people said.  One of Mr. Qahtani's first targets was Mr. Khashoggi, a onetime insider[109] turned government critic whose stinging tweets and Washington Post columns irritated the royal court. At first, Mr. Qahtani used flattery in the name of his boss to lure him back. 'The Crown Prince values your role as an editor,' the messenger, Mr. Qahtani, told Mr. Khashoggi on WhatsApp, a friend of the journalist said. 'He wants you back in Saudi Arabia.' When the journalist refused to return to the kingdom from the U.S., the Saudi government banned his son Salah from leaving. 'I cannot believe you are stooping so low, and that even family members are being targeted now,' Mr. Khashoggi told Mr. Qahtani after he learned of the travel ban on Salah, a friend of the journalist familiar with the message exchange on WhatsApp said. Mr. Qahtani never replied. The Saudi government lifted the travel ban [110]last week. When Mr. Khashoggi entered the consulate in Istanbul for a scheduled meeting on Oct. 2, 18 operatives dispatched from Riyadh were waiting for him. The consular official who scheduled the meeting had been in touch with Mr. Qahtani, two people familiar with the matter said. Another trusted aide of Prince Mohammed assembled the team of operatives: Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri[111], the deputy chief of Saudi Arabia's intelligence, who had worked closely with Mr. Qahtani in a previous role as a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen. Gen. Assiri received the order to assemble and dispatch the team to Istanbul from Mr. Qahtani, several people familiar with the matter said. 'Saud al-Qahtani gave the impression that what he said was what MBS wanted,' a person familiar with the investigation said, using the acronym by which Prince Mohammed is also known More[112]  As New Iran Sanctions Loom, U.S. Aims to Plug Gaps[113]: Trump administration's plan to block Iranian oil exports begins Monday, as it grants waivers allowing eight countries to temporarily import Iranian oil  Ian Talley and Courtney McBride The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  The Trump administration moved Friday toward its goal of maximum economic pressure against Iran, while granting waivers allowing eight countries to temporarily import Iranian oil without facing U.S. punishment. The waivers, to countries that government advisers say include China, Turkey and India, are designed to give them time to switch to other suppliers while sharply reducing or eliminating their purchases of Iranian oil over time. But with the U.S. economic pressure campaign coming into full force at 12:01 a.m. eastern time Monday, American officials also struggled to plug the holes that have plagued past sanctions plans against Iran. Unlike the global support for the Obama administration's penalties, broad opposition to the current U.S. policy, including from European allies, is sure to complicate the task. And Iran has pledged to resist the sanctions. Still, the Trump administration is off to a strong start: Iranian oil exports have fallen by more than a million barrels a day since the White House launched its new campaign in May. That decline represents more than a third of international sales. Iran's economy, with oil accounting for 80% of tax revenue, is in pain. Europe's largest companies have pulled out, and Iranian consumers rushed to exchange their rials, pushing the currency's value to record lows and sparking a surge in consumer prices. In March, the International Monetary Fund forecast Iran's economy would expand by 4% in 2018. Now it predicts a two-year recession, with a 3.6% contraction next year. 'We have seen a dramatic reduction in oil imports by Iran's top importers, a collapse in foreign direct investment, capital flight and banks deciding the cost-benefit analysis of doing business in Iran is simply not there,' said Brian Hook, who heads the State Department's new Iran Action Group, in an interview. The Trump administration's strategy to harden sanctions began with its decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear pact, which triggered the reimposition of many sanctions while giving the U.S. leeway on how leniently or forcefully to apply economic pressure. An executive order issued by President Trump set Nov. 5 as the day the oil sanctions resume.  They prohibit purchases of Iranian oil, with companies facing sanctions unless the State Department grants waivers to their home countries. U.S. officials didn't name the countries receiving waivers on Friday. The government advisers said China, India and Turkey along with South Korea, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Iraq are likely to receive waivers More[114] Trump Digs In for a Long, Cold War With Iran[115]: Latest sanctions aim to 'force' a regime determined to resist Michael R. Gordon The Wall Street Journal Nov. 4, 2018  President Trump has put Iran on notice that the punishing sanctions he plans to impose on Monday are just the opening salvo of an ambitious strategy to compel Tehran to pull back from its assertive posture in the Middle East or risk collapse. 'Our objective is to force the regime into a clear choice: either abandon its destructive behavior or continue down the path toward economic disaster,' Mr. Trump said in a statement Friday night. The guiding assumption behind the administration's policy is that Iran is economically weak, has little interest in a military confrontation with the U.S. and that Washington can force changes in decadeslong Iranian behavior that will reconfigure the Middle East, officials and experts say.  But senior Iranian officials insist Tehran will neither retrench nor negotiate. Former U.S. officials with long experience say Tehran has cards to play, including trying to ride out the sanctions in the hope that Mr. Trump is a one-term president and taking advantage of the continued turmoil in the region to stir up fresh challenges for the U.S. and its allies. 'Iran is gaining ground in the region, and I don't see these sanctions as reversing that,' said Jeffrey Feltman, who was the top State Department official on Middle East issues from 2009 to 2012 and later served as a United Nations undersecretary general for political affairs. An early test of the Trump administration's 'maximum pressure' sanctions campaign will come in Syria. The White House has sought Russian President Vladimir Putin's help in prodding Iranian forces and the Shiite militias[116] Tehran backs to leave the country so far, without success. Administration officials are now calculating that draconian economic measures[117] can prompt Iran to declare its military mission accomplished in Syria and bring its forces home. To drive home the point, U.S. officials have released figures asserting that Iran's annual tab for sustaining its Lebanese ally Hezbollah is about $700 million, while Tehran has spent at least $16 billion in recent years supporting its allies in Syria, Yemen and Iraq. More[118] Iranians rally to mark anniversary of US Embassy takeover[119] Associated Press November 4, 2018 Thousands of Iranians rallied in Tehran on Sunday to mark the 39th anniversary of the U.S. Embassy takeover, as Washington restored all sanctions lifted under the nuclear deal. The crowd chanted 'Down with U.S.' and 'Death to Israel' during the rally in the capital, and state TV said similar demonstrations were held in other cities and towns. Iranian students stormed the embassy shortly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, taking 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. The U.S. cut off diplomatic relations in response. Iran's clerically-led government celebrates the embassy takeover every year as a decisive blow against the United States, which had supported the autocratic rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The embassy compound, widely known as the 'den of spies,' is now a cultural center. Anger and distrust of the United States is surging again following President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers despite Tehran's compliance with the agreement, which was negotiated under the Obama administration. On Friday, the Trump administration announced the restoration of sanctions on Iran's shipping, financial and energy sectors, the second batch of penalties to be restored. Iran is already in the grip of an economic crisis, and has seen sporadic protests in recent months as Iranian officials have tried to downplay the sanctions and their effects More[120] Islamic attack against Coptic Christians pilgrims kills at least 7 in Egypt[121] Associated Press November 3, 2018 CAIRO - Islamic militants on Friday ambushed two buses carrying Christian pilgrims on their way to a remote desert monastery south of the Egyptian capital of Cairo, killing seven and wounding up to 16, according to the Interior Ministry and security officials. Coptic Orthodox Church spokesman Boulos Halim said the death toll was likely to rise. Local church officials in Minya province where the attack took place put the death toll at 10, but the higher figure could not be confirmed. No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of Islamic militants who have for years been fighting security forces in the Sinai Peninsula and along Egypt's porous desert border with Libya. The extremist Islamic State group has repeatedly stated its intention to target Egypt's Christians as punishment for their support of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who, as defense minister, led the military's 2013 ouster of an Islamist president, whose one-year rule proved divisive. El-Sissi wrote on his Twitter account that Friday's attack was designed to harm the 'nation's solid fabric' and pledged to continue fighting terrorism. Friday's attack is the second to target pilgrims heading to the St. Samuel the Confessor monastery in as many years. The previous attack in May 2017 left nearly 30 people dead. It is also the latest in a deadly string of attacks that targeted churches in Cairo, the Mediterranean city of Alexandria and Tanta in the Nile Delta north of the capital. Those attacks, all claimed by the Islamic State group, left at least a 100 people dead and led to tighter security around Christian places of worship and other Church-linked facilities. The Interior Ministry, which oversees the police, and the security officials said Friday's attackers used secondary dirt roads to reach the buses carrying the pilgrims, who were near the monastery at the time of the attack. Only pilgrims have been allowed on the main road leading to the monastery since last year's attack.  The security officials said the attackers opened fire on the two buses carrying pilgrims from Bani Suef and Sohag provinces, also south of Cairo. The Sohag bus had 28 pilgrims, of whom 9 were wounded, including two in serious condition. The Bani Suef bus carried 14 passengers, of whom seven were killed and the rest seriously wounded The Interior Ministry said police were pursuing the attackers, who fled the scene. Egypt's Christians, who account for some 10 percent of the country's 100 million people, complain of discrimination in the Muslim majority country. Christian activists say the church's alliance with el-Sissi has offered the ancient community a measure of protection but failed to end frequent acts of discrimination that boils over into violence against Christians, especially in rural Egypt More[122] Egypt Arrests Human-Rights Lawyers as Crackdown on Critics Intensifies[123]: The detentions are striking because of their scale and the prominence of those arrested  Democracy does not work in the Islamic worldEven their best leaders are repressive dictators These rulers have no choiceThe precepts of Islam are hostile to the very concept of man-made lawwhich it views to be in opposition to Islam's Allah-given Sharia law Dave Jared Malsin The Wall Street Journal Nov. 2, 2018  CAIRO Egyptian security forces arrested at least 19 human-rights lawyers and activists this week in raids that reflect the country's security state is widening its assault on government critics[124] in an attempt to eliminate any challenge to President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi.[125] Even against the backdrop of years of government repression, this week's arrests were striking because of the large number of people held and the detention of prominent human-rights lawyers  'It's a vicious attack,' said Aida Seif El Dawla, founder of a center working with victims of torture by Egyptian police. 'Every day, every second day there is a group of people who are arrested.' Mr. Sisi came to power in a military coup in 2013, in which he led the overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi[126] of the Muslim Brotherhood. Following the coup, the state set in motion a lethal crackdown on Islamists, in which more than a thousand died and tens of thousands were arrested. In the following years, the government widened its target to include non-Islamist political opponents, human-rights groups, independent news organizations, and anyone critical of the new military-backed government. The Egyptian government has defended its actions against critics, stating that the moves are intended to restore stability and security to the country following years of political unrest and violence following the 2011 revolution that ousted Hosni Mubarak from the presidency. During this week's raids, security forces burst into the homes of human-rights workers in the early morning hours, seizing the activists and searching their properties. Those arrested included Huda Abdelmonem, a prominent lawyer and a former member of the National Council for Human Rights, a government-backed watchdog. Members of Ms. Abdelmonem's family published images of her apartment in the aftermath of the raid, with papers, books, furniture and personal items strewn about, suggesting a violent search by security forces. The whereabouts of the 19 people arrested Thursday are currently unknown, according to human-rights groups monitoring the case More[127] The post FREEDOM UPDATE: Who is in the Caravan?; Update on Border Wall in Texas; More[128] appeared first on Western Free Press[129].

There's no expectation to privacy when you're out on the public street.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former Ald. Terry Witkowski</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">who represented West Layton Avenue area</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's like an old-fashioned block watch, but with a digital twist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of peering out windows, people are looking at their computers and phones, watching video footage from their doorbell cameras.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In some Milwaukee neighborhoods, the police may wind up watching, too.</p><p>Two south side business improvement districts and a separate business association recently partnered with the Milwaukee Police Department to provide area residents free and discounted Ring cameras. The camera company is owned by tech giant Amazon.</p><p>Residents who receive free cameras through the business groups are required to sign agreements that they will cooperate with law enforcement requests, buy Ring's cloud storage service and use their cameras \"appropriately.\"</p><p>\"Any of type of camera system being used is always beneficial,\" said Milwaukee Police Capt. Kristin Riestra, who oversees District 6 on the city's south side. \"It's an extension of the old-school block watch.\"</p><p>The agreements help police build a network of cameras across the city. They also allow officers to get footage quickly, without obtaining a search warrant. That and other factors have raised privacy concerns.</p><p>\"What we've seen and what particularly concerns civil rights advocates and the ACLU is a growing surveillance state with police having access to an ever-expanding network of cameras,\" said Tim Muth, an attorney at ACLU of Wisconsin.</p><p>Officials with Ring would not tell the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel how many police departments they are working with nationwide. But tech news organization CNET reported that Ring has partnered with more than 50 departments, including those in Houston and Bloomfield, New Jersey.</p><p>The company sells its cheapest cameras for $99. MPD received discount codes for about $40 off the cameras. In some cases, they are given free to residents.</p><p>In all, at least 175 have been given out in the past two years.</p><p>Police access to the information isn't the only worry cited by critics.</p><p>It is unclear how Amazon uses data from the Ring cameras. It isn't certain how Ring camera use is monitored. And it's unknown how Amazon plans to further develop its facial recognition technology, which can be tied in to the cameras.</p><p>Tara Cavazos, executive director of the Historic Highway 41 BID, maintains that the cameras help reduce  burglaries, vandalization and other crimes in her area. Historic Highway 41 runs along West Layton Avenue.</p><p>She recalls two arrests based on Ring camera evidence.</p><p>\"It's everyone assisting everyone,\" Cavazos said of the Ring-camera initiative. \"Unless something major happens, law enforcement is not going to come to you and ask you for your camera.\"</p><p>Police partnership</p><p>Evidence is key for police officers, who gather a variety of materials as they track suspects.</p><p>Ring is a way to get that evidence quickly.</p><p>\"This is the wave of the future,\" said former Ald. Terry Witkowski, who represented the West Layton Avenue area until stepping down in late May. \"There's no expectation to privacy when you're out on the public street.\"</p><p>Before he was an alderman, Witkowski worked on the Milwaukee Safety Commission, where he eventually became safety director.</p><p>Looking at a digital map, officers can see which households have registered Ring cameras. Officers can then request video footage from those households. The department has addresses, names and contact information of people who received free cameras, along with others who choose to register their cameras voluntarily, Cavazos said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ring's free smartphone application, called Neighbors, shows locations of video or written posts by residents. Users can instantly share live and recorded Ring videos with others. The app operates as an open forum for people to ask one another about suspicious activities.</p><p>MPD, like other departments, monitors posts on the Neighbors app.</p><p>\"Camera owners that share video with the Milwaukee Police Department play a crucial role in the ability of the Milwaukee Police to solve crime and keep our neighborhoods safe for people to live, work and raise a family,\" the department said in a statement.</p><p>It is unclear how many households and businesses have registered Ring cameras and how often MPD monitors the Neighbors app or residents using Ring footage. The department did not respond to questions about Ring from the Journal Sentinel.</p><p>Not only do the cameras hold criminals accountable, they hold police responsible, too.</p><p>Bay View resident Daniela Perez said she reported to officials when her Ring cameras caught members of MPD repeatedly stopping foster teens on her block. She said the teens were approached in their cars and on their front porch - and that officers tried to wrongly pin one of the teens as a crime suspect.</p><p>\"It just gets really frustrating because residents of the Bay View neighborhood want to be safe, but it's really hard when we have video evidence showing that these same poor teenagers are being targeted,\" Perez said.</p><p>Perez said she and other residents reported the incidents to MPD, but were told that officers were \"just doing their jobs.\"</p><p>MPD did not respond to Perez's allegations, but encouraged residents to contact police with concerns.</p><p>'What if I forget to close my blinds?'</p><p>To get a free Ring camera, residents might be sacrificing some freedoms.</p><p>The Historic Highway 41 BID has residents sign written agreements when claiming free cameras.</p><p>Muth said the written agreements - which require police cooperation and storage subscriptions - present a \"huge problem.\" He said police should still need a warrant to search someone's personal property.</p><p>Ring itself has spoken out against these kinds of agreements.</p><p>\"Ring does not support programs that require recipients to subscribe to a recording plan or share footage as a condition for receiving a donated device,\" a Ring spokesperson said in a statement. \"We are actively working with partners to ensure this is reflected in their programs.\"</p><p>Cavazos, meanwhile, said her BID's decision to create the agreements \"really is not tied into what Ring's thoughts are on it.\"</p><p>Another part of the local agreement asks users to operate their Ring cameras appropriately, though it is unclear what this means or how it is enforced.</p><p>\"We just want to be clear that we're giving it to people in good faith,\" Cavazos said.</p><p>Ring cameras capture the field of view chosen by their owners.</p><p>Bay View resident Blaine Venturine said he's worried cameras might capture private moments inside nearby households.</p><p>\"What if I forget to close my blinds?\" Venturine asked.</p><p>Unknown how data is used</p><p>It's unclear how Amazon uses Ring customers' data and video footage.</p><p>It's a fact that leaves some Milwaukee residents concerned.</p><p>Brent Bublitz, who lives  north of Bay View, said he purchased surveillance cameras from another company to store his own footage. His data stays on a hard drive in his basement.</p><p>He can't access the footage remotely like Ring users can, but Bublitz has peace of mind.</p><p>\"I'm not reliant on a company that I would have to pay a monthly fee to access the video,\" Bublitz said. \"The video will always be there when I need it.\"</p><p>Muth said keeping footage on a hard drive prevents users from unknowingly giving data to a big tech company.</p><p>\"You get this picture of Big Brother government law enforcement agencies with access to hundreds of millions of images of people going about their daily life,\" Muth said.</p><p>Still, Ring cameras keep attracting customers. One selling point: They don't require users to have personal computers or set up hard drive space.</p><p>\"I'm a realist to recognize people are going to like the convenience of the ease of setting up a Ring doorbell system,\" Muth said. \"They can just look at it in this app that's already created.\"</p><p>Muth encouraged people with Ring cameras to read privacy policies in full. The Federal Trade Commission and other authorities can take action if a company deceives users.</p><p>\"That being said, I'm not sure that the companies so far are afraid of the regulators,\" Muth said.</p><p>Ring did not provide a response to a Journal Sentinel question about how it addresses privacy concerns.</p><p>\"Privacy and security and consent are extremely important to us, and every decision we make as a company centers around these three pillars,\" a Ring spokesperson said.</p><p>Facial recognition and racial profiling</p><p>On the Neighbors app, videos of people doing nothing more than ringing doorbells are shared constantly.</p><p>\"Does anyone know this man?\" a resident asked on the afternoon on July 5.</p><p>\"Does anybody recognize this man or his company?\" another resident asked on the evening of July 11.</p><p>Muth is concerned about the unconscious biases that arise when people share videos of neighborhood visitors.</p><p>\"I have a real concern that there would be a certain level of racial profiling - that people are more likely, unfortunately, to post pictures of people of color coming to their door and ringing their doorbell than they would if it was just a white person,\" Muth said.</p><p>The effects of this could extend beyond the Neighbors app.</p><p>Amazon offers facial recognition technology, called Rekognition, that allows people to add video and image analysis to their Ring devices.</p><p>The ACLU obtained marketing materials showing that Amazon promotes Rekognition to law enforcement agencies. Police departments can build databases of mugshot photos and use Amazon's facial recognition technology to scan for matches from Ring surveillance footage.</p><p>The ACLU found that the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon were Rekognition customers.</p><p>MPD did not comment when asked by the Journal Sentinel if it uses Rekognition.</p><p>The partnership with the Orlando Police Department recently ended after city officials said the technology had glitches and infrastructure issues, the Orlando Weekly reported. The Weekly reported that the department was never able to test images.</p><p>The ACLU tested Amazon's facial recognition system on members of Congress in July 2018 and found that false matches disproportionately affected people of color.</p><p>While people of color made up about 20% of Congress at the time, about 40% of the false matches were people of color. The test incorrectly identified 28 members of Congress as people who have been arrested for a crime.</p><p>Financial investment</p><p>Two years into the Ring partnership, three Milwaukee business organizations have invested about $30,000 in implementing Ring surveillance technology.</p><p>Milwaukee's Historic Highway 41 BID partnered in 2018 with the Gateway to Milwaukee business association, which works to bolster economic development around Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. At the time, Highway 41 BID's safety committee and Gateway to Milwaukee each invested $7,000 to purchase Ring cameras.</p><p>In 2019, the Crisol Corridor BID - located near the intersection of South 13th Street and West Oklahoma Avenue - joined in on the collaboration. All three organizations then invested $5,000 each into Ring technology.</p><p>MPD was recognized for the joint efforts with the Outstanding Greater Milwaukee Partnership award in February, overseen by nonprofit organizations Safe &amp; Sound and LISC Milwaukee. The award honors \"partnerships that have contributed to reducing crime, fear and disorder in their respective community.\"</p><p>The future of the partnership isn't set in stone.</p><p>Cavazos said the BIDs' Ring collaboration with MPD in 2020 will depend on results of a survey of residents and crime rate data, among other factors. She expects to receive this information in October or November before a decision is made.</p><p>\"This is the wave of the future. There's no expectation to privacy when you're out on the public street.\"</p><p>Former Ald.

Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is pushing for strict regulations to break up companies including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. According to the New York Times, Warren told a crowd in Long Island City on March 8 that those companies \"think they can roll over everyone.\"</p><p>Two weeks later, the Democrat that chairs the House's antitrust committee, David Cicilline, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.</p><p>\"There is ... mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers,\" Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, wrote in the Times.</p><p>\"For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.\"</p><p>While the idea appears to be gaining momentum south of the border, at least in Democratic circles, there's been almost no discussion of a similar course of action being taken in Canada - even as the Liberal government looks to create new regulations for social media platforms and internet companies.</p><p>The Competition Act - Canada's antitrust law - allows a tribunal to examine companies' practices and prohibit anti-competitive behaviour, including the \"abuse of dominance\" in a market.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with becoming big. There's nothing wrong with doing really, really well and achieving high market share. But if you abuse it and engage in abusive tactics (that) are primarily meant to harm your competitor, that's when the law can step in,\" said lawyer Oliver Borgers, a senior partner at McCarthy T&amp;#233;trault's competition and foreign investment group.</p><p>\"What we don't have as a framework today is that if you're just big, and we just think it'd be better if we broke you up into smaller pieces? There are no laws on the books that allow that.\"</p><p>But if the Competition Bureau thinks a company has abused its strong market position, Borgers added, \"they can seek fines and orders for the abuse to stop.\"</p><p>Joe Martin, the director of Canadian Business History at the Rotman School of Management, questioned whether antitrust laws - or even the Canadian government itself - have the power to regulate companies that are not only international, but almost \"post-national\" in nature.</p><p>\"How does a nation state, never mind Canada, how does the United States deal with this?\" said Martin, who used to lead Deloitte's international consulting operation, in an interview.</p><p>\"I haven't got my head around how nation states deal with post-nation state businesses.\"</p><p>But Dwayne Winseck, a Carleton journalism and communications professor, said that he believes tech giants require \"serious countervailing regulatory forces\" -including requiring behemoths like Facebook and Google to divest themselves of the companies they've acquired over the years.</p><p>\"The big internet companies do dominate in their respective areas, in particular digital online advertising,\" Winseck wrote in an email to the Star.</p><p>\"(We need to) rely on formal regulatory measures with a clear legislative foundation and judicial oversight, (rather than) the great penchant growing in too many circles ... for voluntary 'codes of practice,' as in the EU's Disinformation Code of Practice and the U.K.'s white paper on online harms.\"</p><p>The governing Liberals seem to have already moved on from the idea that social media and tech giants will voluntarily move to safeguard democracy. Democratic Institutions Minister Karina Gould told reporters last month that she believes self-regulation has failed, and that the government will move to take more active measures.</p><p>Whatever attempt at regulating tech giants the Liberal government lands on, there's little time for this Parliament to debate - let alone pass - new legislation, with just six scheduled sitting weeks left before the summer break and the coming election.</p><p>But the government will have an opportunity to provide greater clarity on its thinking at the end of the month, when the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\" holds its hearings in Ottawa.</p><p>The committee - which includes representatives from nine parliaments, including Canada, France, and the U.K. - was created after the U.K. Parliament's investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, and is continuing to study how governments can hold digital platforms to account.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

According to the New York Times, Warren told a crowd in Long Island City on March 8 that those companies \"think they can roll over everyone.\"</p><p>Two weeks later, the Democrat that chairs the House's antitrust committee, David Cicilline, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.</p><p>\"There is ... mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers,\" Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, wrote in the Times.</p><p>\"For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.\"</p><p>While the idea appears to be gaining momentum south of the border, at least in Democratic circles, there's been almost no discussion of a similar course of action being taken in Canada - even as the Liberal government looks to create new regulations for social media platforms and internet companies.</p><p>The Competition Act - Canada's antitrust law - allows a tribunal to examine companies' practices and prohibit anti-competitive behaviour, including the \"abuse of dominance\" in a market.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with becoming big. There's nothing wrong with doing really, really well and achieving high market share. But if you abuse it and engage in abusive tactics (that) are primarily meant to harm your competitor, that's when the law can step in,\" said lawyer Oliver Borgers, a senior partner at McCarthy T&amp;#233;trault's competition and foreign investment group.</p><p>\"What we don't have as a framework today is that if you're just big, and we just think it'd be better if we broke you up into smaller pieces? There are no laws on the books that allow that.\"</p><p>But if the Competition Bureau thinks a company has abused its strong market position, Borgers added, \"they can seek fines and orders for the abuse to stop.\"</p><p>Joe Martin, the director of Canadian Business History at the Rotman School of Management, questioned whether antitrust laws - or even the Canadian government itself - have the power to regulate companies that are not only international, but almost \"post-national\" in nature.</p><p>\"How does a nation state, never mind Canada, how does the United States deal with this?\" said Martin, who used to lead Deloitte's international consulting operation, in an interview.</p><p>\"I haven't got my head around how nation states deal with post-nation state businesses.\"</p><p>Whatever attempt at regulating tech giants the Liberal government lands on, there's little time for this Parliament to debate - let alone pass - new legislation, with just six scheduled sitting weeks left before the summer break and the coming election.</p><p>But the government will have an opportunity to provide greater clarity on its thinking at the end of the month, when the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\" holds its hearings in Ottawa.</p><p>The committee - which includes representatives from nine parliaments, including Canada, France, and the U.K. - was created after the U.K. Parliament's investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, and is continuing to study how governments can hold digital platforms to account.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

According to the New York Times, Warren told a crowd in Long Island City on March 8 that those companies \"think they can roll over everyone.\"</p><p>Two weeks later, the Democrat that chairs the House's antitrust committee, David Cicilline, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.</p><p>\"There is ... mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers,\" Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, wrote in the Times.</p><p>\"For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.\"</p><p>While the idea appears to be gaining momentum south of the border, at least in Democratic circles, there's been almost no discussion of a similar course of action being taken in Canada - even as the Liberal government looks to create new regulations for social media platforms and internet companies.</p><p>The Competition Act - Canada's antitrust law - allows a tribunal to examine companies' practices and prohibit anti-competitive behaviour, including the \"abuse of dominance\" in a market.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with becoming big. There's nothing wrong with doing really, really well and achieving high market share. But if you abuse it and engage in abusive tactics (that) are primarily meant to harm your competitor, that's when the law can step in,\" said lawyer Oliver Borgers, a senior partner at McCarthy T&amp;#233;trault's competition and foreign investment group.</p><p>\"What we don't have as a framework today is that if you're just big, and we just think it'd be better if we broke you up into smaller pieces? There are no laws on the books that allow that.\"</p><p>But if the Competition Bureau thinks a company has abused its strong market position, Borgers added, \"they can seek fines and orders for the abuse to stop.\"</p><p>Joe Martin, the director of Canadian Business History at the Rotman School of Management, questioned whether antitrust laws - or even the Canadian government itself - have the power to regulate companies that are not only international, but almost \"post-national\" in nature.</p><p>\"How does a nation state, never mind Canada, how does the United States deal with this?\" said Martin, who used to lead Deloitte's international consulting operation, in an interview.</p><p>\"I haven't got my head around how nation states deal with post-nation state businesses.\"</p><p>Whatever attempt at regulating tech giants the Liberal government lands on, there's little time for this Parliament to debate - let alone pass - new legislation, with just six scheduled sitting weeks left before the summer break and the coming election.</p><p>But the government will have an opportunity to provide greater clarity on its thinking at the end of the month, when the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\" holds its hearings in Ottawa.</p><p>The committee - which includes representatives from nine parliaments, including Canada, France, and the U.K. - was created after the U.K. Parliament's investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, and is continuing to study how governments can hold digital platforms to account.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, is pushing for strict regulations to break up companies including Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple. According to the New York Times, Warren told a crowd in Long Island City on March 8 that those companies \"think they can roll over everyone.\"</p><p>Two weeks later, the Democrat that chairs the House's antitrust committee, David Cicilline, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.</p><p>\"There is ... mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers,\" Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, wrote in the Times.</p><p>\"For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.\"</p><p>While the idea appears to be gaining momentum south of the border, at least in Democratic circles, there's been almost no discussion of a similar course of action being taken in Canada - even as the Liberal government looks to create new regulations for social media platforms and internet companies.</p><p>The Competition Act - Canada's antitrust law - allows a tribunal to examine companies' practices and prohibit anti-competitive behaviour, including the \"abuse of dominance\" in a market.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with becoming big. There's nothing wrong with doing really, really well and achieving high market share. But if you abuse it and engage in abusive tactics (that) are primarily meant to harm your competitor, that's when the law can step in,\" said lawyer Oliver Borgers, a senior partner at McCarthy T&amp;#233;trault's competition and foreign investment group.</p><p>\"What we don't have as a framework today is that if you're just big, and we just think it'd be better if we broke you up into smaller pieces? There are no laws on the books that allow that.\"</p><p>But if the Competition Bureau thinks a company has abused its strong market position, Borgers added, \"they can seek fines and orders for the abuse to stop.\"</p><p>Joe Martin, the director of Canadian Business History at the Rotman School of Management, questioned whether antitrust laws - or even the Canadian government itself - have the power to regulate companies that are not only international, but almost \"post-national\" in nature.</p><p>\"How does a nation state, never mind Canada, how does the United States deal with this?\" said Martin, who used to lead Deloitte's international consulting operation, in an interview.</p><p>\"I haven't got my head around how nation states deal with post-nation state businesses.\"</p><p>Whatever attempt at regulating tech giants the Liberal government lands on, there's little time for this Parliament to debate - let alone pass - new legislation, with just six scheduled sitting weeks left before the summer break and the coming election.</p><p>But the government will have an opportunity to provide greater clarity on its thinking at the end of the month, when the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\" holds its hearings in Ottawa.</p><p>The committee - which includes representatives from nine parliaments, including Canada, France, and the U.K. - was created after the U.K. Parliament's investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, and is continuing to study how governments can hold digital platforms to account.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

According to the New York Times, Warren told a crowd in Long Island City on March 8 that those companies \"think they can roll over everyone.\"</p><p>Two weeks later, the Democrat that chairs the House's antitrust committee, David Cicilline, called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Facebook.</p><p>\"There is ... mounting evidence of anticompetitive conduct by Facebook that may warrant scrutiny by federal antitrust enforcers,\" Cicilline, a congressman from Rhode Island, wrote in the Times.</p><p>\"For example, the social media goliath has reportedly systematically spied on its rivals, giving it valuable information on how people used competitive products.\"</p><p>While the idea appears to be gaining momentum south of the border, at least in Democratic circles, there's been almost no discussion of a similar course of action being taken in Canada - even as the Liberal government looks to create new regulations for social media platforms and internet companies.</p><p>The Competition Act - Canada's antitrust law - allows a tribunal to examine companies' practices and prohibit anti-competitive behaviour, including the \"abuse of dominance\" in a market.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with becoming big. There's nothing wrong with doing really, really well and achieving high market share. But if you abuse it and engage in abusive tactics (that) are primarily meant to harm your competitor, that's when the law can step in,\" said lawyer Oliver Borgers, a senior partner at McCarthy T&amp;#233;trault's competition and foreign investment group.</p><p>\"What we don't have as a framework today is that if you're just big, and we just think it'd be better if we broke you up into smaller pieces? There are no laws on the books that allow that.\"</p><p>But if the Competition Bureau thinks a company has abused its strong market position, Borgers added, \"they can seek fines and orders for the abuse to stop.\"</p><p>Whatever regulations for social media and tech giants the Liberal government lands on, there's little time for this Parliament to debate - let alone pass - new legislation, with just six scheduled sitting weeks left before the summer break and the coming election.</p><p>But the government will have an opportunity to provide greater clarity on their thinking at the end of the month, when the International Grand Committee on Disinformation and \"Fake News\" holds its hearings in Ottawa.</p><p>The committee - which includes representatives from nine parliaments, including Canada, France, and the U.K. - was created after the U.K. Parliament's investigation into Facebook's Cambridge Analytica scandal, and is continuing to study how governments can hold digital platforms to account.</p><p>Alex Boutilier is an Ottawa-based reporter covering national politics.

Anna Eshoo (D-California), Zoe Lofgren (D-California) and Suzan DelBene (D-Washington) joined Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Connecticut) and Mark Warner (D-Virginia) to introduce a privacy bill addressing the use of technology to track the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Public Health Emergency Privacy Act (PHEPA) provides needed regulations on exposure-notification and contact-tracing applications whether built and deployed by state and local governments or by tech companies and other private-sector employers. These protections mandate that the use of these digital tools be voluntary; that information collected -- such as medical diagnoses and exam data, and location or proximity information -- be limited to what's necessary and proportionate to addressing the public-health crisis.</p><p>The bill bans commercial use of that information, and protects the civil rights of people who use these applications by preventing discrimination in access to public-facing businesses like stores, and other commercial establishments and public spaces, based on whether a person uses such an application or not.</p><p>Free Press Action Senior Policy Counsel Gaurav Laroia made the following statement:</p><p>\"There's an understandable desire to use state-of-the-art technology to combat the spread of COVID-19. Some of these technologies may prove effective in addressing this public-health emergency, but efforts to contain coronavirus shouldn't open the door to a more abusive and discriminatory surveillance system.</p><p>\"Governments and businesses across the world have begun deploying digital technology to trace people's movements and contacts to help stop the spread of the disease. Almost all of that information collection and tracking is unregulated here in the United States, opening the door to potential abuses. This bill would put many necessary protections in place to make sure the technology is used responsibly.</p><p>\"This bill makes it clear that we don't need to completely sacrifice privacy, data protection and civil rights to make these tools effective. And for them to work, a large majority of cellphone users would need to use them. Without PHEPA's protections to secure this information, people will be reluctant to use contact-tracing applications in the numbers needed to make the technology useful.</p><p>\"Unlike the proposal put forth by Senator Wicker and other Senate Republicans, PHEPA also protects workers from undue and unnecessary surveillance. Black and Latinx essential workers are bearing the brunt of this crisis while dying in disproportionate numbers. Digital tools may help keep them safe, but employers' use of these tools must be regulated. This crisis cannot turn already difficult working conditions into a pretext to deploy long-lasting and unnecessary worker surveillance.</p><p>\"If we've learned anything from experience with widespread data collection it's that stringent safeguards and oversight are necessary to prevent personal data from falling into the hands of those who seek to misuse it. The bill rightfully tightly ties this data collection to solving the public-health crisis and prevents using that information for commercial purposes. The bill also prohibits the unnecessary sharing of that data with law-enforcement agencies -- which would undermine the goal of widespread adoption, especially among the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"We've seen big tech companies mishandle data they collect from their users, exploiting it for purposes other than those they officially claim. Their promises to protect our essential information aren't enough. We need policies to limit data collection at its source, with clear restrictions and rules on what's being gathered, by whom, how it's being stored, how it gets used and for how long. PHEPA puts many of these vital safeguards in place.\"</p><p>[Category: Media]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-7113580 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR7113580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX3-8BC1-JC11-127P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As they begin operations, their revolutionary business models run into resistance from cities that are skeptical of their promises and worried about their impact. Sounds like an Uber and Lyft redux, right? But this time, the new technology comes on two wheels. </p><p> The rise of dockless, or stationless, bike-share systems\u2014which allow users to find and check out free-roaming bikes with a smartphone and leave them anywhere they want once they finish their trip\u2014can help expand the benefits of biking without the financial overhead, according to proponents.  'Bikes are like a city's best friend,' says Rob McPherson, a cofounder of Baas Bikes[1], a D.C.-based company promoting dockless technology for college campuses. 'This could be the next big evolution in public transit, if done well.'  Spin Spin dockless bikes in Austin. The startup launched a new, station-free bikesharing system in the city in March Picking up where traditional bike-share systems, such as Divvy in Chicago, left off, these stationless systems, connected and controlled with GPS and mobile tech, deliver a more 'frictionless' experience (to borrow a phrase from the startup world, which is beginning to invest in the technology[2]\u2014LimeBike, which is seeking to enter the Bay Area market in April, just raised $12 million from venture capital firms, including the influential Andreessen Horowitz[3]). When spared the expense of docking stations, cities can devote more money to bike infrastructure, and more riders get access to cycling at a cheaper cost. 'Nobody is against the idea of stationless bike sharing. They're against rogue bike sharing that works against local authorities and isn't safe for the public.' But some city transportation officials in the U.S. where these systems have already rolled out aren't fully convinced. Two companies working in those markets\u2014Bluegogo[4] in San Francisco, and Spin[5] in Austin\u2014have already run into issues, making the Uber comparison even more apt.  'The problem is when companies come in with no respect for regulations, and questionable quality,' says Heath Maddox, a planner and project manager for the San Francisco Metropolitan Transit Authority. 'Nobody is against the idea of stationless bike sharing. They're against rogue bike sharing that works against local authorities and isn't safe for the public.'  Maddox, who is also a member of the North American Bike Share Association[6], a nonprofit promoting the expansion of the industry, is for technological innovation and an expansion of bike-share systems, as long as companies play by the rules.  'The MTA supports innovation,' he says. 'But it has to be done right, and they have to be good neighbors.' The next phase of city bike sharingFor startups pushing dockless bike share, the time seems ripe. In the space of a decade, the technology has proliferated across the country,[7] with 55 systems and more than 42,000 bikes available in a number of U.S cities, with more growth expected in the coming years[8].  By freeing systems from infrastructure investments, the dockless concept hopes to make expansion quicker, help it reach more underserved communities, and save riders money (Bluegogo charges $0.99 per half hour, while Spin costs $1 for the same ride).  According to Maddox, the systems don't use new technology; it's more of an evolution of what's already on the road. Current systems in Portland and Phoenix already utilize smart bikes with cellular hookups on each bike, which can be parked anywhere, but include 'dumb' docks (just branded bike racks, really) to incentivize centralized return so operators can better monitor, maintain, and track their fleets. Operators of the new systems without docks or physical infrastructure promise that they'll be able to leverage technology to help them reposition and recover bikes to avoid cycles clumping in high traffic areas, or potentially being left on the street or in unsafe places, blocking traffic.  We're fired up to announce our partnership with Salisbury University to roll out our new approach for bikeshare! 100 @ridepriority bikes will be available on campus over the next couple days[9] A post shared by Baas Bikes (@baas_bikes) on Aug 29, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT  According to Derrick Ko, co-founder of Spin, his company has a strong technical team analyzing traffic flow and publicly available data to smartly and efficiently position bikes. With the right systems for placement in place, he thinks Austin can be a huge market (Spin plans to put 100,000 bikes on the road in the U.S. this year).  'It's the last step in solving the last-mile transportation issue,' Ko says. 'We're talking about affordable transport available to everybody.' Some even go a step further. McPherson's company, Baas (short for 'bike as a service'), doesn't even provide the bikes. Their sharing system, currently in use at James Madison University in Virginia and Salisbury University in Maryland, provides digital locks, which look like big gray water bottles, that can be attached to any bike. According to McPherson, the technology lets schools purchase their own fleet, and allows students to add their own, old bikes to the marketplace.  'We want to get bikes into the hands of people that want them,' he says. 'We cost pennies compared to normal systems.' While a transit planner like Maddox agrees the technology could extend bike sharing and provide access to underserved areas, he's slightly skeptical of the business models of these new companies. He's not sure of the maintenance costs required to both reposition bikes (an expense shared by all bike share programs) as well as clear away bikes that are blocking right-of-ways or left in the wrong place.  Getty Images Two Chinese women ride bike share bicycles past piles of thousands of damaged bicycles from the bike share company Ofo Inc. that were collected from the streets at a repair depot for the company on March 30, 2017 in Beijing, China. China's Great Wall of discarded bikes Part of the skepticism comes from the industry's history in China, where stiff competition between startups has led to a literal flooding of the market. Tapping into the country's traditional embrace of cycling, as well as the growth of the sharing economy, companies such as Mobike and Ofo have aggressively expanded dockless technology in Chinese cities. The rush, dubbed 'Uber for Bikes[10],' is frenzied: Mobike alone has introduced roughly one million bikes into 18 Chinese cities.  McPherson says the mad rush to get bikes on the street was due to China's strong cycling culture, and the government's quest to fight smog and pollution. The government promoted the growth of these companies, and since most bike manufacturing in the world now happens in China, the startups could 'flip the switch and make thousands in a week.'  But that boom, which is prepping for export to cities across the world, has its downsides. The increase in dockless bikes hasn't been met with a parallel drive to build cycling infrastructure, and maintenance and fleet upkeep has been fickle in many cases. There are numerous reports of users discarding these rental bikes in huge[11], colorful piles[12]. 'The strategy we've seen in China is to flood the market with bikes, so there are all these companies out there that aren't really interested in promoting bikes in transportation, they're just trying to get and spend venture capital money,' says Maddox. 'We're seeing that strategy begin to emerge in San Francisco and Austin and other cities.' 'We won't be allowing bikes just anywhere on the street. They operate lawlessly in China.'Chinese companies are now eyeing Britain and the U.S. as potential markets. Bluegogo, which had a false start in San Francisco, is the U.S. arm of a company that has 130,000 bikes operating in China. According to a spokesperson for Bluegogo in San Francisco, North American operations will be totally different.  'We will not be operating like the company does in China,' says Lindsay Stevens. 'We won't be allowing bikes just anywhere on the street. They operate lawlessly in China.'Making waves in San FranciscoAnother big part of the skepticism comes from the rocky reception some of these new systems have had in the U.S. Bluegogo's introduction to the San Francisco [13]market recalls some of the same pitfalls experienced by transportation companies like Uber and Lyft: a new tech company jumped in, not willing to wait for the city to update rules and regulations to accommodate a new business model.  According to Maddox, Bluegogo began operating without permits in late January. When city transportation officials initially expressed skepticism about the system opening in San Francisco, Bluegogo decided to try a different tactic: they purchased 19 private parking lots around the city, setting them up as 'stations,' to get around city complaints.  'The problem was I didn't have regulatory authority over them,' says Maddox. 'We don't want to stifle this technology. But it's important for cities like San Francisco for there to be a level playing field. When we negotiated a contract with Motivate [the city's traditional bike-share system], we got bike redistribution, certain safety standards, maintenance standards, and a system compliant with existing rights and regulations.'  Bluegogo's rollout was also met with condemnation by many city politicians, who called the system a safety issue and cited frustration with similar moves by tech companies, such as Uber's botched December rollout of driverless cars without permits[14]. Spin faced similar issues in Austin, where the city temporarily shut down[15] the system during its SXSW rollout due to fears the bikes would block sidewalks. 'Every single time, these arrogant tech companies ask later for forgiveness, or ask later for permission,' said San Francisco city supervisor Aaron Peskin, according to the San Francisco Business Journal[16]. 'This is the first time where San Francisco has gotten ahead of the curve.' On March 24, 2017, San Francisco approved a new law, co-sponsored by Peskin, establishing rules and a permitting process for dockless systems, which will go into effect in late April.  Stevens, Bluegogo's spokesperson, says there's a misunderstanding about how her company operates.  'If the bikes are parked illegally, we can easily fix them up and move them back to the public bike racks,' she says.  Adam Brinklow Bluegogo bikes waiting at a private parking space, which the company had previously turned into de facto stations  Stevens says the company is dedicated to promoting health, extending bike-share systems into underserved communities in San Francisco, and expanding the availability of cycling in general. Plus, Bluegogo, at just 99 cents for every half-hour of use, is cheaper than Motivate, the Ford-owned bike-share system which uses docks, costs $9 for a day rental[17] (Bluegogo also just cut their $90 deposit fee to use the system, making it even more accessible).  'We didn't realize it would take so long to get approved, but we're happy to work with the city,' she says. 'Everybody wants to start up here in the big tech hub. We want to show other cities that legislation can work. If we can do it here, we can do it anywhere.' According to Stevens, Bluegogo started the process of suspending operations yesterday, and will soon have all their bikes off the road, in anticipation of working with the city on the new permitting process. One the process begins\u2014Maddox expects to start permitting in late April\u2014Bluegogo expects to scale quickly, eventually putting few hundred bikes on city streets this spring. During a follow-up call this morning, when Maddox was informed that the company had suspended operations, he said it was 'news to him.' He opened up the Bluegogo app and saw bikes spread across the city.  'Bikes are all over San Francisco right now, and they haven't cleaned up their mess yet,' he says. 'It's going to be a tall order for them to get a permit, based on the behavior we've seen so far.'

Proponents say it would level the field between copyright holders and online platforms, but critics warn that it would stifle free expression and interfere with the basic functioning of the internet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposal, which would levy fees for quoting online news stories and limit the protections for platforms that host content uploaded by users, is billed as an attempt to narrow what supporters call a \"value gap\" between the copyright holders and online platforms, such as YouTube, Pinterest, and Google News, that have seen their fortunes rise as they freely distributed copyrighted videos, photographs, and snippets of news stories.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This could have immediate consequences for American companies that do business in Europe, just as Europe's sweeping new law on privacy has. It could also influence the shape of copyright laws well outside of European borders if it's used as a standard to push for reforms elsewhere, including in the United States.</p><p>Its supporters include some of the biggest entertainment companies and publishers in Europe, including Germany's Axel Springer. Opponents say that the law will do little to put more money in the hands of artists and journalists, and that it would serve only to benefit big tech companies.</p><p>\"This is supposed to be a way to transfer money from Google to German newspaper families,\" says writer and activist Cory Doctorow, \"but it's going to absolutely devastate the public discourse that makes Wikipedia legal.\"</p><p>The 'link tax'</p><p>The proposal itself is far-reaching, the most comprehensive revamping of EU copyright law since 2001, before Facebook and YouTube existed. It includes many measures that have widespread support, such as rules to ease restrictions on sharing educational material across borders. But two provisions have generated an outpouring of criticism.</p><p>The first, known as Article 11, would establish fees for quoting snippets of online news articles, such as the headlines, photos, and summaries that you might see on Google News or displayed when someone shares a hyperlink on Twitter or Facebook.</p><p>Critics of Article 11 have dubbed it a \"link tax,\" because, even though it does not prohibit hyperlinking itself, it does limit the ways that links can be displayed. They warn that handing control of even small snippets of news stories to publishers would limit the amount of news that people are exposed to. That's apparently what happened when Spain's legislature enacted a similar law in 2014: Google News closed in Spain, and a study commissioned by Spanish publishers found that the law damaged their bottom line.</p><p>From the perspective of many news publishers, however, Article 11 simply does for the news what other copyright laws do for other kinds of content.</p><p>\"Article 11 establishes publishers as rights holders, which enables them to better protect their investments online,\" says Wout van Wijk, the executive director of News Media Europe, a trade group that represents more than 2,000 print and online titles. \"This is a proven concept: other creative industries, like the music and the film industry have successfully enjoyed such a related right for years now.\"</p><p>Whether it's the push to protect privacy of its citizens, including the \"right to be forgotten\" from search engines, to new laws against who is accountable for hate speech on Twitter, to class-action suits against Facebook, Europeans have attempted to reign in the influence of Silicon Valley that transcends their borders. And this copyright battle has been presented as a similar power struggle, says Leonhard Dobusch, a professor of organization at the University of Innsbruck in Austria who is an expert on transnational copyright regulation and a founder of Right2Remix.</p><p>\"That is how they sell it,\" he says. But it's not a simple power struggle, despite legitimate concerns about the control of American companies in Europe. One of the major backers of Article 11 is German publisher Axel Springer, Europe's largest digital publishing house, which Professor Dobusch says is playing off of Europe's \"anti-Google and to some extent anti-American sentiment.\"</p><p>\"In a way,\" he says, \"it's why a lot of politicians are on board.\"</p><p>\"Honestly I wouldn't care about it if it was anti-Google,\" says Caroline De Cock, coordinator of the Copyright for Creativity coalition which opposes the measure, \"because that's not my job to protect Google. But the reality is that the way it's written, it applies to a lot of other things like libraries, which I do care about.\"</p><p>An end to 'safe harbor' protections?</p><p>Another controversial provision, Article 13, would limit the \"safe harbor\" protection enjoyed by sites that allow users to post \"large amounts\" of content. Current EU law protects platforms like Facebook, SoundCloud, Dailymotion, and Vimeo from users who upload copyrighted content, treating them as a \"mere conduit\" for the actions of users.</p><p>V\u00e9ronique Desbrosses, the general manager the European Grouping of Societies of Authors and Composers argues that such platforms play an active role in organizing and distributing material.</p><p>\"They select the content,\" says Ms. Desbrosses, who denies that the law would affect Wikipedia. \"They promote certain content. They categorize the content. They cannot be considered passive intermediaries.\"</p><p>If Article 13 goes into effect, platforms would be required not just to remove infringing material from their site, as they are now, but to preemptively block it from appearing in the first place.</p><p>This means that sites would need to employ automatic content filters similar to YouTube's Content ID system, which allows copyright holders to identify their own works and then block or monetize user-uploaded videos that contain their works.</p><p>\"What the EU commission has proposed is basically to make every other platform more like YouTube,\" says Julia Reda, a member of the European Parliament and of Germany's Pirate Party, which seeks to liberalize copyright. \"It is playing into this fantasy that you can somehow use filters to solve all the problems on the internet.\"</p><p>In 2016, Google, which owns YouTube, said that the company had spent $60 million developing Content ID. Ms. Reda warns that this price tag could stifle smaller online platforms whose names aren't \"Google\" and \"Facebook.\"</p><p>\"My fear is that if this proposal goes through it will be exactly those large tech companies that are developing the filters that will benefit from it,\" Reda says. \"But it will not actually help artists and it will certainly curtail freedom of speech online.\"</p><p>Mr. Doctorow explains how these filters could limit Europeans' ability to seek and share information. \"The only companies that operate these big copyright filters right now are American,\" he says. \"So really what we're about to do is create a rule that says that Europeans communications with each other have to be given to an American company for evaluation, and if the American company doesn't like them, they won't be allowed to post them.\"</p><p>Article 13 has drawn battle lines similar to that of Article 11. One of its biggest backers is the French entertainment industry, which maintains powerful connections with France's political set. France has always fought against what it perceives as the creep of American cultural imperialism, with rules about content that must be French-produced to protect society from the imbalance of Hollywood budgets.</p><p>But Dobusch, and many others, say this isn't the way to take on Big Tech or American culture.</p><p>\"Copyright law is very complex,\" he says. \"Previously it was not of importance for ordinary people. So you bought a book, you bought a CD, you weren't allowed to resell the book, to make copies from it at a copying machine. ... Now with the internet everyone gets into contact with copyright law.\"</p><p>Eoin O'Carroll reported this story from Amherst, Mass., and\u00a0Sara Miller Llana contributed reporting from Paris.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-15100c81ba6ed9f2cb16adb53d70e3c9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SKT-D261-JC8H-M338-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1360\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 19, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He followed this threat up with an executive order that would encourage federal regulators to allow tech companies to be held liable for the comments, videos, and other content posted by users on their platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As is often the case with this president, his actions were more than a touch self-serving and legally dubious absent a congressionally legislated regulatory framework.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite himself, Trump does raise an interesting issue - namely whether and how the US should regulate the social-media companies such as Twitter and Facebook, as well as the search engines (Google, Bing) that disseminate their content. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act largely immunizes Internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content (in contrast to conventional media).</p><p>The statute directed US courts not to hold providers liable for removing content, even if the content is constitutionally protected. On the other hand, it doesn't direct the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to enforce anything, which calls into question whether the FCC does in fact have the existing legal authority to regulate social media (see this article by Harold Feld, senior vice-president of the think-tank Public Knowledge, for more elaboration on this point).</p><p>Nor is it clear that vigorous antitrust remedies via the Federal Trade Commission would solve the problem, even though FTC chairman Joe Simons suggested last year that breaking up major technology platforms could be the right remedy to rein in dominant companies and restore competition.</p><p>In spite of Simons' enthusiasm for undoing past mergers, it is unclear how breaking up the social-media behemoths and turning them into smaller entities would automatically produce competition that would simultaneously solve problems like fake news, revenge porn, cyberbullying, or hate speech. In fact, it might produce the opposite result, much as the elimination of the \"fairness doctrine\" laid the foundations for the emergence of a multitude of hyper-partisan talk-radio shows in the US and, later, Fox News.</p><p>Given the current conditions, the Silicon Valley-based social-media giants have rarely had to face consequences for the dissemination of misinformation, or outright distortion (in the form of fake news), and have profited mightily from it.</p><p>The US Congress has made various attempts to establish a broader regulatory framework for social-media companies over the past few years, in part by imposing existing TV and radio ad regulations on them, introducing privacy legislation in California, as well as having congressional hearings featuring Facebook, Twitter and Google, where their CEOs testified on social media's role in spreading disinformation during the 2016 US election.</p><p>But an overarching attempt to establish a regulatory framework for social media has seldom found consensus among the power lobbies in Washington, and, consequently, legislative efforts have foundered.</p><p>As the 2020 US elections near, the Republican Party has little interest in censoring Donald Trump. Likewise, Silicon Valley elites have largely seized control of the Democratic Party's policy-making apparatus, so good luck expecting that party to push hard on regulating big tech, especially if their dollars ultimately help to lead the country to a Biden presidency and a congressional supermajority.</p><p>As things stand today, there's not even a hint of a regulatory impulse in this direction in Joe Biden's camp. As for Donald Trump, he can fulminate all he likes about having Twitter calling into question the veracity of his tweets, but that very conflict is red meat for his base.</p><p>Trump wants to distract Americans from the awful coronavirus death toll, which recently topped 100,000, civil unrest on the streets of America's major cities, and a deep recession that has put 41 million Americans out of work. A war with Twitter is right out of his usual political playbook.</p><p>By the same token, social-media companies cannot solve this problem simply by making themselves the final arbiter of fact-checking, as opposed to an independent regulatory body. Twitter attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump looks like a self-serving attempt to forestall a more substantial regulatory effort.</p><p>Even under the generous assumption that social-media giants had the financial resources, knowledge, or people to do this correctly, as a general principle, it is not a good idea to let the principal actors of an industry regulate themselves, especially when that arbiter is in effect one person, as is the case at Facebook.</p><p>As Atlantic columnist Zeynep Tufekci wrote recently, \"Facebook's young CEO is an emperor of information who decides rules of amplification and access to speech for billions of people, simply due to the way ownership of Facebook shares [is] structured: Zuckerberg personally controls 60% of the voting power.\"</p><p>At least Zuckerberg (unlike Twitter's Jack Dorsey) has personally acknowledged that \"Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.... Private companies probably shouldn't be, especially these platform companies, shouldn't be in the position of doing that.\"</p><p>As things stand today, existing legal guidelines for digital platforms in the US fall under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The goal of that legislation was to establish some guidelines for digital platforms in light of the jumble of (often conflicting) pre-existing case law that had arisen well before we had the Internet.</p><p>The legislation broadly immunizes Internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content. By contrast, a platform that publishes digitally can still be held liable for its own content, of course. So a newspaper such as The New York Times or an online publication such as the Daily Beast could still be held liable for one of its own articles online, but not for its comments section.</p><p>While the quality of public discourse has suffered mightily for the immunity granted by Section 230, the American public doesn't have much power to do anything about it.</p><p>There is, however, a growing coalition of business powers that have bristled for many years at their inability to hold these platforms accountable for the claims made by critics and customers of their products, and to prevent the expansion of Section 230 into international trade agreements, as it had already seeped into parts of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.</p><p>A New York Times story about the fight explained that \"companies' motivations vary somewhat.</p><p>Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.\"</p><p>At this point, it is necessary to be prepared for the sophistication and capacity of business lobbies in Washington to initiate a national controversy like the recent headlines of struggles at Twitter and Facebook with Trump to serve a long-term regulatory goal.</p><p>US Senator Ron Wyden, an advocate of Section 230, argued that \"companies in return for that protection - that they wouldn't be sued indiscriminately - were being responsible in terms of policing their platforms.\"</p><p>In other words, the quid pro quo for such immunity was precisely the kind of moderation that is conspicuously lacking today. However, Danielle Citron, a University of Maryland law professor and author of the book Hate Crimes in Cyberspace, suggested there was no quid pro quo in the legislation, noting that \"there are countless individuals who are chased offline as a result of cyber mobs and harassment.\"</p><p>In addition to the issues of intimidation or targeted groups cited by Citron, there are other problems, such as the dissemination of content designed to interfere with the function of democracy (seen in evidence in the 2016 presidential election), that can otherwise disrupt society.</p><p>This is not a problem unique to the United States. Disinformation was spread during the Brexit referendum, for starters. Another overseas example is featured in a Wall Street Journal article that reported in June, \"After a live stream of a shooting spree at New Zealand mosques last year was posted on Facebook, Australia passed legislation that allows social-media platforms to be fined if they don't remove violent content quickly.\"</p><p>Likewise, Germany passed its NetzDG law, which was designed to compel large social-media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and YouTube, to block or remove \"manifestly unlawful\" content, such as hate speech, \"within 24 hours of receiving a complaint but have up to one week or potentially more if further investigation is required,\" according to an analysis of the law written by Human Rights Watch.</p><p>It is unclear whether Section 230 confers similar obligations in the US.</p><p>Public Knowledge's Harold Feld noted that Section 230 does not exempt the application of federal or state criminal laws, such as sex trafficking or illegal drugs, with respect to third-party content protection. But he recognized that it by no means constitutes a complete solution to the problems raised here.</p><p>In his book The Case for the Digital Platform Act, he proposes that Congress create a new agency with permanent oversight jurisdiction over social media. Such an agency could \"monitor the impact of a law over time, and ... mitigate impacts from a law that turns out to be too harsh in practice, or creates uncertainty, or otherwise has negative unintended consequences.\"</p><p>To maintain ample flexibility and democratic legitimacy, Feld proposed that the agency have the \"capacity to report to Congress on the need to amend legislation in light of unfolding developments.\"</p><p>Regulating the free-for-all on social media is unlikely to circumscribe Americans' civil liberties or democracy one way or another. The experiment in letting anybody say whatever he or she wants, true or false, and be heard instantly around the world at the push of a button has done less to serve the cause of free speech, or enhance the quality of journalism, than it has to turn a few social-media entrepreneurs into multi-hundred millionaires or billionaires.</p><p>We Americans managed to have the civil-rights revolution even though radio and TV and Hollywood were regulated, so there is no reason to think that a more robust series of regulations of social media will throw us back into the political dark ages or stifle free expression.</p><p>Even with the dawn of the Internet era, major journalistic exposes have largely emerged from traditional newspapers and magazines, online publications such as the Huffington Post, or curated blogs, not random tweets, or Facebook posts. Congress should call Trump's bluff on social media, by crafting regulation appropriate for the 21st century.</p><p>That may have to wait until after the 2020 election, but it is a problem that won't go away.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Likewise, Silicon Valley elites have largely seized control of the Democratic Party\u2019s policy-making apparatus, so good luck expecting that party to push hard on regulating big tech, especially if their dollars ultimately help to lead the country to a Biden presidency and a congressional supermajority. </p><p/><p>As things stand today, there\u2019s not even a hint of a regulatory impulse in this direction in Joe Biden\u2019s camp. As for Donald Trump, he can fulminate all he likes about having Twitter calling into question the veracity of his tweets, but that very conflict is red meat for his base. </p><p>Trump wants to distract Americans from the awful coronavirus death toll, which recently topped 100,000, civil unrest on the streets of America\u2019s major cities, and a deep recession that has put 41 million Americans out of work. A war with Twitter is right out of his usual political playbook.</p><p>By the same token, social-media companies cannot solve this problem simply by making themselves the final arbiter of fact-checking, as opposed to an independent regulatory body. Twitter attaching a fact check to a tweet from President Trump looks like a self-serving attempt to forestall a more substantial regulatory effort. </p><p>Even under the generous assumption that social-media giants had the financial resources, knowledge, or people to do this correctly, as a general principle, it is not a good idea to let the principal actors of an industry regulate themselves, especially when that arbiter is in effect one person, as is the case at Facebook. </p><p>As Atlantic columnist Zeynep Tufekci\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/der-isnt-about-twitter-612349-/fm2gg4/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">wrote</url>\u00a0recently, \u201cFacebook\u2019s young CEO is an emperor of information who decides rules of amplification and access to speech for billions of people, simply\u00a0due to the way       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/kerberg-facebook-stock-nyt-wsj/fm2gg6/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">ownership of Facebook shares</url> [is] structured: Zuckerberg personally controls 60% of the voting power.\u201d </p><p/><p>At least Zuckerberg (unlike Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey)\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/rg-twitter-fact-checking-trump/fm2gg8/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">has personally acknowledged</url>\u00a0that \u201cFacebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online.\u2026 Private companies probably shouldn\u2019t be, especially these platform companies, shouldn\u2019t be in the position of doing that.\u201d</p><p>As things stand today, existing legal guidelines for digital platforms in the US fall under <url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/uscode-text-47-230/fm2gfs/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</url>. The goal of that legislation was to establish some guidelines for digital platforms in light of the jumble of (often conflicting) pre-existing case law that had arisen well before we had the Internet. </p><p>The legislation broadly immunizes Internet platforms from any liability as a publisher or speaker for third-party content. By contrast, a platform that publishes digitally can still be held liable for its own content, of course. So a newspaper such as The New York Times or an online publication such as the Daily Beast could still be held liable for one of its own articles online, but not for its comments section.</p><p>While the quality of public discourse has suffered mightily for the immunity granted by Section 230, the American public doesn\u2019t have much power to do anything about it. </p><p>There is, however, a growing coalition of business powers that have bristled for many years at their inability to hold these platforms accountable for the claims made by critics and customers of their products, and to prevent the expansion of Section 230 into international trade agreements, as it had already seeped into parts of the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.asiatimesfinancial.com/?src=atinarticle1\"/></p><p>A\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/hnology-section-230-lobby-html/fm2ggg/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">New York Times story about the fight</url> explained that\u00a0\u201ccompanies\u2019 motivations vary somewhat.

The experiment in letting anybody say whatever he or she wants, true or false, and be heard instantly around the world at the push of a button has done less to serve the cause of free speech, or enhance the quality of journalism, than it has to turn a few social-media entrepreneurs into multi-hundred millionaires or billionaires.</p><p>We Americans managed to have the civil-rights revolution even though radio and TV and Hollywood were regulated, so there is no reason to think that a more robust series of regulations of social media will throw us back into the political dark ages or stifle free expression. </p><p>Even with the dawn of the Internet era, major journalistic expos\u00e9s have largely emerged from traditional newspapers and magazines, online publications such as the Huffington Post, or curated blogs, not random tweets, or Facebook posts. Congress should call Trump\u2019s bluff on social media, by crafting regulation appropriate for the 21st century.</p><p>That may have to wait until after the 2020 election, but it is a problem that won\u2019t go away.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article was produced by</emphasis>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://go.ind.media/e/546932/economy-for-all-/fm2gh2/633290817?h=oBy75Tyfr2unu4eQxUF_G9jrvwkKR9cu3Ec25XS9IRo\">Economy for All</url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a project of the Independent Media Institute, which provided it to Asia Times.</emphasis></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIAEN-500966</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIAEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:602B-K501-JBMP-W320-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470004</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1884\"/><timeReceived>10:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Asia Times (Hong Kong) Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia Times-English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16105\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 4, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Independent Media Institute</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

A featured blog post[1] in the Oxford Political Review, authored in April by Joshua Krook, suggested that COVID-19 had brought a host of benefits for big tech companies. Isolation ushered people towards online platforms. Engagement on such platforms had increased dramatically. </p><p>Names were not mentioned. Krook's then employer, the Australian Public Service, made no appearance in the text. Tech entities were not outed, though Krook noted, in general, how 'big tech companies' have been 'pursuing the attention economy', seeking to get 'all our attention at all times.' With COVID-19, this had been achieved. 'People are trapped indoors, at home, on their devices at all times, with nowhere to go.' Krook's tone did come across as a touch judgmental, suggesting that replacing 'human connection with technology has never felt so nakedly negative.' He likened big tech entities to spouses who know 'everything about you.' By giving them information about yourself, a loss of free will is perpetrated precisely 'because the person, or company, knows so much about you.' It took three months for Krook to get the call. The managers of the APS took issue with the post. Its pessimism might damage the government's relationship with the technology industry. In Krook's words[2] to the Guardian, 'the problem was that in talking about the big tech companies, we risked damaging the relationship the government has with big tech companies and that when we go and do public-private partnerships, they could Google my name, find my article and then refuse to work with us.' Had the article been ingratiating - 'positive about the big tech companies' - it would have been entirely permissible. His options were starkly simple: remove the post or face termination of employment. Any future pieces would have to go through the censoring scissors of the service. What followed was the usual pattern. The cold sweat of initial alarm; a quick request to the Oxford Political Review that the blog post be removed. Deletion. Then, a reconsideration of matters, the growth of a backbone to resist: quitting the job in the public sector and talking about civil service censorship. As Krook explained[3] in the Oxford Political Review: 'I resigned from my job in the government because I fundamentally disagree with the decision. The Australian government should not be involved in censoring personal blog posts. Public servants should be able to criticize private companies, including big tech companies. There is no conflict of interest. Freedom of speech is fundamental to a thriving, secular democracy.' It pays to know what creatures you are working for, and what strange armour they insist on wearing when they deal with expression. Know their values and code of conduct, because they are bound to be conversely related to what is actually intended. Ideas will only be permitted in such an ecosystem if they are expressed with respect, which usually means causing no offense to the thick and unimaginative. What is challenging is bound to be offensive; what is audaciously defying is bound to rub the dullards the wrong way. The APS, for instance, has a code of conduct which deals with 'employees as citizens'. This has a sinister edge to it. The APS acknowledges in Section 6 of the Code[4] that employees are citizens and members of the community but 'the right to serve the community as APS employees comes with certain responsibilities.' Central to the point is a notion that has been stretched and mangled in punishing supposed transgressions by APS employees. Responsibilities, for instance, 'include maintaining confidence of the community in the capacity of the APS, and each member to it, to undertake their duties professionally and impartially.' This comes terribly close to having no opinions, or at least the sort you can legitimately express. The section further gives clues as to what an APS employee should, or should not do. Be careful making comments in an unofficial capacity (no mention of the healthy thoughts of such a person as an engaged private citizen). Be wary of participating in political activities, participating in acts that might generate a conflict of interest, be cautious when working overseas and when being 'identifiable as an APS employee.' Naturally, such elastic codes are drafted in ways that suggest openness and fairness, while coldly repudiating them. There is, for instance, a tentative nod to the engagement of APS employees 'in robust discussion as an important part of open government.' But the lid is tightly shut on the issue of public comments, which must conform to the 'APS Values, Employment Principles and the Code.' And public comments are broad indeed, covering public speech, online media including blogs and social media networking sites. Michaela Banerji, formerly an employee of the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship, found at much personal cost that tweeting critically[5] about government policy on refugees, even anonymously, was sufficient to get her sacked. Her heroic effort to bring her messages and opinions within the realms of Australia's implied right to freedom of communication on political subjects was snootily dismissed by the country's highest court[6] in 2019. The implied right was not a personal one, intoned the High Court judges, but 'a restriction on legislative power which arises as a necessary implication' on construing various sections of the Australian Constitution 'and as such, extends only so far as is necessary to preserve and protect the system of representative and responsible government mandated by the Constitution.' Justice James Edelman went so far as to claim that the APS Code did not turn 'public servants into lonely ghosts' but conceded that it would cast 'a powerful chill over political communication.' All that interested the judges, however, was that Banerji had been given a proportionate penalty balanced against preserving a neutral public service. Had Krook dared test the waters of litigation, it would have been grimly interesting how the High Court might have distinguished his case to that of Banerji's, given that he expressed no criticism in the post of the government or government policy. The Krook affair also reveals another disturbing trend. With all that froth and babble about regulators keen to rein in the power of Silicon Valley, we have an object lesson about how keen the Australian government is to stay in the warming bed of big tech. Google, Facebook and other representatives will be delighted by this stinging hypocrisy. Public servants have been crudely warned: do not write pieces, however general, about the consequences of the COVID-19 tech world and its delighted Silicon Valley stalwarts.

A featured blog post in the Oxford Political Review, authored in April by Joshua Krook, suggested that COVID-19 had brought a host of benefits for big tech companies. Isolation ushered people towards online platforms. Engagement on such platforms had increased dramatically.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Names were not mentioned. Krook's then employer, the Australian Public Service, made no appearance in the text. Tech entities were not outed, though Krook noted, in general, how \"big tech companies\" have been \"pursuing the attention economy\", seeking to get \"all our attention at all times.\" With COVID-19, this had been achieved. \"People are trapped indoors, at home, on their devices at all times, with nowhere to go.\" Krook's tone did come across as a touch judgmental, suggesting that replacing \"human connection with technology has never felt so nakedly negative.\" He likened big tech entities to spouses who know \"everything about you.\" By giving them information about yourself, a loss of free will is perpetrated precisely \"because the person, or company, knows so much about you.\" </p><p>It took three months for Krook to get the call. The managers of the APS took issue with the post. It's pessimism might damage the government's relationship with the technology industry. In Krook's words to the Guardian, \"the problem was that in talking about the big tech companies, we risked damaging the relationship the government has with big tech companies and that when we go and do public-private partnerships, they could Google my name, find my article and then refuse to work with us.\" Had the article been ingratiating \u2013 \"positive about the big tech companies\" \u2013 it would have been entirely permissible. His options were starkly simple: remove the post or face termination of employment. Any future pieces would have to go through the censoring scissors of the service.</p><p>What followed was the usual pattern. The cold sweat of initial alarm; a quick request to the Oxford Political Review that the blog post be removed. Deletion. Then, a reconsideration of matters, the growth of a backbone to resist: quitting the job in the public sector and talking about civil service censorship.</p><p>As Krook explained in the Oxford Political Review, \"I resigned from my job in the government because I fundamentally disagree with the decision. The Australian government should not be involved in censoring personal blog posts. Public servants should be able to criticize private companies, including big tech companies. There is no conflict of interest. Freedom of speech is fundamental to a thriving, secular democracy.\"</p><p>It pays to know what creatures you are working for, and what strange armour they insist on wearing when they deal with expression. Know their values and code of conduct, because they are bound to be conversely related to what is actually intended. Ideas will only be permitted in such an ecosystem if they are expressed with respect, which usually means causing no offense to the thick and unimaginative. What is challenging is bound to be offensive; what is audaciously defying is bound to rub the dullards the wrong way.</p><p>The APS, for instance, has a code of conduct which deals with \"employees as citizens\". This has a sinister edge to it. The APS acknowledges in Section 6 of the Code that employees are citizens and members of the community but \"the right to serve the community as APS employees comes with certain responsibilities.\" Central to the point is a notion that has been stretched and mangled in punishing supposed transgressions by APS employees. Responsibilities, for instance, \"include maintaining confidence of the community in the capacity of the APS, and each member to it, to undertake their duties professionally and impartially.\" This comes terribly close to having no opinions, or at least the sort you can legitimately express.</p><p>The section further gives clues as to what an APS employee should, or should not do. Be careful making comments in an unofficial capacity (no mention of the healthy thoughts of such a person as an engaged private citizen). Be wary of participating in political activities, participating in acts that might generate a conflict of interest, be cautious when working overseas and when being \"identifiable as an APS employee.\"</p><p>Naturally, such elastic codes are drafted in ways that suggest openness and fairness, while coldly repudiating them. There is, for instance, a tentative nod to the engagement of APS employees \"in robust discussion \u2026 as an important part of open government.\" But the lid is tightly shut on the issue of public comments, which must conform to the \"APS Values, Employment Principles and the Code.\" And public comments are broad indeed, covering public speech, online media including blogs and social media networking sites. </p><p>Michaela Banerji, formerly an employee of the Australian Department of Immigration and Citizenship, found at much personal cost that tweeting critically about government policy on refugees, even anonymously, was sufficient to get her sacked. Her heroic effort to bring her messages and opinions within the realms of Australia's implied right to freedom of communication on political subjects was snootily dismissed by the country's highest court in 2019. The implied right was not a personal one, intoned the High Court judges, but \"a restriction on legislative power which arises as a necessary implication\" on construing various sections of the Australian Constitution \"and as such, extends only so far as is necessary to preserve and protect the system of representative and responsible government mandated by the Constitution.\" </p><p>Justice James Edelman went so far as to claim that the APS Code did not turn \"public servants into lonely ghosts\" but conceded that it would cast \"a powerful chill over political communication.\" All that interested the judges, however, was that Banerji had been given a proportionate penalty balanced against preserving a neutral public service. Had Krook dared test the waters of litigation, it would have been grimly interesting how the High Court might have distinguished his case to that of Banerji's, given that he expressed no criticism in the post of the government or government policy.</p><p>The Krook affair also reveals another disturbing trend. With all that froth and babble about regulators keen to rein in the power of Silicon Valley, we have an object lesson about how keen the Australian government is to stay in the warming bed of big tech. Google, Facebook and other representatives will be delighted by this stinging hypocrisy. Public servants have been crudely warned: do not write pieces, however general, about the consequences of the COVID-19 tech world and its delighted Silicon Valley stalwarts.</p><p>The article Free Speech Be Damned: Joshua Krook And The Australian Public Service - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-182933684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60P0-Y4K1-JDJN-63MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1147\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 25, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They would hand unwarranted power to the information commissioner, who is a government appointee, and to Impress, a media regulator backed by the state and funded in large part by an avowed enemy of the press.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They would, in some circumstances, force newspapers to pay the costs of lawsuits filed against them even when these actions failed. In addition, they would pave the way for a full-scale public inquiry into data protection breaches by the media, even though such breaches are already punishable by law and such an inquiry has already been held.</p><p>The current Data Protection Act was passed in 1998. The reasons that a revised version is now before parliament have little to do with the press and much more to do with the advent of the internet, big data and big tech firms as dominant influences in public and private life.</p><p>This sea change in the information environment has brought pressure to bear on the EU from its member states, which for now include Britain, for updated data protection laws. The impulse is understandable. The internet has transformed the meaning of privacy, which enjoys particular legal status in Germany because of its unique past and which is seen as under renewed threat there since the disclosure of American spying on <person><nameText>Angela Merkel, </nameText></person>the chancellor, and her ministers.</p><p>European concerns about data protection should not, however, be used as a Trojan horse for an assault on British press freedoms. Yet that is what is happening. The Brussels regulations on which the new data protection bill is based include vital exemptions for investigative journalism, which depends on the ability to use private data for the purposes of journalism. These exemptions have long existed in British law. Their inclusion in the EU regulations was fought for by Britain, which should be proud of its historic role as a beacon of free speech in a continent still scarred by the legacy of totalitarianism.</p><p>Such exemptions ought not to be eroded. They have enabled The Times to expose the grooming of teenage girls for sex in Rotherham and Rochdale. Likewise they have allowed The Sunday Times to reveal corruption at the heart of Fifa, and Panorama to lay bare fraudulent abuse of the student loans system.</p><p>Their lordships should keep this in mind. Criminals and errant politicians minded to misuse the law to launder their reputations might by well-served by the measures being debated today. The British public would not be.</p><p>These amendments are also hostile to press freedom because of the bodies they would empower. One amendment would punish newspapers such as The Times for refusing to sign up to be regulated by Impress, even though that organisation is financed largely by the former Formula One boss Max Mosley, whose animus towards the press is well known, and even though effective independent press regulation already exists in the form of the Independent Press Standards Organisation.</p><p>Any civilised society accepts that a balance must be struck between freedom of expression embodied by a free press, and the right to privacy. The European Convention on Human Rights enshrines both, as does British law, but there is now a serious danger that the pendulum swings too far towards the latter. Freedom itself will suffer if the House of Lords does not defend it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-132592464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R5H-X8N1-DY9P-N2VW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 13, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Scotland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Heck, I can even remember John Perry Barlow's hippielibertarian \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" - a place \"where anyone, anywhere, may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, \"it's the morning after the freespeech party, and the place is trashed\". Don't take it from me. Those words come from twentysomething Adam, a content moderator in one of the \"trust and safety teams\" now employed by Facebook, Google and the other network platforms to detect and remove \"hate speech\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, YouTube announced that it was \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status\". It swiftly became clear what that meant in practice. On Wednesday, as The New York Times reported, \"numerous far-right creators began complaining that their videos had been deleted or had been stripped of ads, presumably a result of the new policy\".</p><p>As if to test YouTube out, a Vox journalist named Carlos Maza demanded that it ban Steven Crowder, the host of a raucous political show, on the grounds Crowder had repeatedly made homophobic jokes about him. \"I've been called an anchor baby, a lispy queer, a Mexican, etc,\" Maza wrote on Twitter. At first, YouTube resisted, arguing that Crowder hadn't violated the company's terms of service, but soon - partly under pressure from other employees of Google, its owner - it folded, announcing that it had \"suspended this channel's monetisation ... because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community\".</p><p>I knew nothing of either Maza or Crowder until last week. The point of this column is not to defend the latter or the obnoxious \"Socialism is for fags\" T-shirt he sometimes wears on his show. The point I want to make is the more general one that free speech on the internet is in free fall.</p><p>Crowder has company. The cofounder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, also had his YouTube presence restricted this year. Last month, Facebook banned not only the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but also the alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the white supremacist Paul Nehlen, the African-American Muslim zealot Louis Farrakhan and the right-wing journalist Laura Loomer.</p><p>And those are just the better-known names. In a recent report, Facebook boasted that the proportion of hate speech it found \"proactively\" - before users reported it - had risen to 65% in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Having previously confined themselves to removing paedophile and terrorist content, the big tech companies are now openly engaged in political censorship. Google admits as much: an internal presentation last March was actually entitled \"The Good Censor\". What this means in practice is that tens of thousands of content moderators such as young Adam are deciding what you can and cannot see online.</p><p>Here's another of them, talking to Silicon Valley lawyer Alex Feerst: \"I was like, 'I can just block this entire domain, and they won't be able to serve ads on it?' And the answer was, 'Yes.' I was like, 'But ... I'm in my mid-twenties.' \" In Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's vision of the future was \"a boot stamping on a human face - for ever\". In 2019, it turns out to be a geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>You may not care for any of the people I have mentioned thus far. You might still not care if I tell you that interviews my wife and I have done (for, respectively, the US political talk show hosts Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin) have been \"demonetised\" by YouTube, meaning that advertisements were not associated with them and therefore Prager and Rubin could not earn money from them. The point is not who gets censored or demonetised. The point is that companies as big and ubiquitous as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power. Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees that \"we have too much power over speech\".</p><p>When so many people now read an article such as this after being directed to it by one or other of the tech platforms, it is true to say that the platforms are, in the words of recently retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy, \"the modern public square\". Yet they are emphatically not acting in that spirit - unless it was Tiananmen Square Kennedy had in mind.</p><p>Remember, the First Amendment to the US constitution bars Congress from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\", and the Supreme Court has allowed few exceptions. Much more than in Europe, US courts are reluctant to penalise speech, even when plaintiffs allege defamation, invasion of privacy or emotional distress.</p><p>But none of this applies online, where (in the words of two legal scholars) the big tech companies can \"act as legislature, executive, judiciary and press\". For they are doubly protected. First, the First Amendment is generally held not to apply to private companies. Second, section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act explicitly states that \"interactive computer services\" are not publishers (so, unlike newspapers, they can't be held responsible for bad stuff that appears on their platforms), but they also cannot be \"held liable on account of ... any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" (so they can't be accused of restricting free speech when they delete bad stuff ). To call section 230 - which was enacted when the internet was in its infancy - an anachronism would be an understatement. It would be more accurate to say that it is the Catch-22 of our time, in that big tech firms are not publishers when harm arises from the content on their platforms, but they are publishers when they engage in censorship. Either way, they have minimal legal liability.</p><p>Yet section 230 (a) (3) explicitly assumed online platforms would \"offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse\". And the phrase \"or otherwise objectionable\" was never intended to cover political positions.</p><p>These days, in Washington, there is a great deal of discussion of \"breaking up big tech\" by resuscitating or reforming competition law. Other voices (including, suspiciously, the big tech companies) clamour for more regulation. But the free-speech crisis can and should be simply addressed. The network platforms handle far too much content to be effective publishers. They are entitled to section 230's protection - but only if they uphold the diversity of discourse envisaged by Congress.</p><p>The alternative is to repeal section 230 and impose on big tech something like a First Amendment obligation not to limit free speech. Speaking as one of the last surviving members of the freespeech party, I'd prefer that second option. But either would be an improvement on that geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford</p><p>Companies such as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-150006902</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W99-XBJ1-DYTY-C1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1212\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Northern Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 9, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Heck, I can even remember John Perry Barlow's hippielibertarian \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" - a place \"where anyone, anywhere, may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, \"it's the morning after the freespeech party, and the place is trashed\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Don't take it from me. Those words come from twentysomething Adam, a content moderator in one of the \"trust and safety teams\" now employed by Facebook, Google and the other network platforms to detect and remove \"hate speech\".</p><p>Last week, YouTube announced that it was \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status\". It swiftly became clear what that meant in practice. On Wednesday, as The New York Times reported, \"numerous far-right creators began complaining that their videos had been deleted or had been stripped of ads, presumably a result of the new policy\".</p><p>As if to test YouTube out, a Vox journalist named Carlos Maza demanded that it ban Steven Crowder, the host of a raucous political show, on the grounds Crowder had repeatedly made homophobic jokes about him.</p><p>\"I've been called an anchor baby, a lispy queer, a Mexican, etc,\" Maza wrote on Twitter. At first, YouTube resisted, arguing that Crowder hadn't violated the company's terms of service, but soon - partly under pressure from other employees of Google, its owner - it folded, announcing that it had \"suspended this channel's monetisation \u2026 because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community\".</p><p>I knew nothing of either Maza or Crowder until last week. The point of this column is not to defend the latter or the obnoxious \"Socialism is for fags\" T-shirt he sometimes wears on his show.</p><p>The point I want to make is the more general one that free speech on the internet is in free fall.</p><p>Crowder has company. The cofounder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, also had his YouTube presence restricted this year. Last month, Facebook banned not only the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but also the alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the white supremacist Paul Nehlen, the African-American Muslim zealot Louis Farrakhan and the right-wing journalist Laura Loomer.</p><p>And those are just the better-known names. In a recent report, Facebook boasted that the proportion of hate speech it found \"proactively\" - before users reported it - had risen to 65% in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Having previously confined themselves to removing paedophile and terrorist content, the big tech companies are now openly engaged in political censorship. Google admits as much: an internal presentation last March was actually entitled \"The Good Censor\".</p><p>What this means in practice is that tens of thousands of content moderators such as young Adam are deciding what you can and cannot see online.</p><p>Here's another of them, talking to Silicon Valley lawyer Alex Feerst: \"I was like, 'I can just block this entire domain, and they won't be able to serve ads on it?' And the answer was, 'Yes.' I was like, 'But \u2026 I'm in my mid-twenties.' \" In Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's vision of the future was \"a boot stamping on a human face - for ever\". In 2019, it turns out to be a geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>You may not care for any of the people I have mentioned thus far. You might still not care if I tell you that interviews my wife and I have done (for, respectively, the US political talk show hosts Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin) have been \"demonetised\" by YouTube, meaning that advertisements were not associated with them and therefore Prager and Rubin could not earn money from them.</p><p>The point is not who gets censored or demonetised. The point is that companies as big and ubiquitous as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power. Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees that \"we have too much power over speech\".</p><p>When so many people now read an article such as this after being directed to it by one or other of the tech platforms, it is true to say that the platforms are, in the words of recently retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy, \"the modern public square\". Yet they are emphatically not acting in that spirit - unless it was Tiananmen Square Kennedy had in mind.</p><p>Remember, the First Amendment to the US constitution bars Congress from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\", and the Supreme Court has allowed few exceptions. Much more than in Europe, US courts are reluctant to penalise speech, even when plaintiffs allege defamation, invasion of privacy or emotional distress.</p><p>But none of this applies online, where (in the words of two legal scholars) the big tech companies can \"act as legislature, executive, judiciary and press\". For they are doubly protected.</p><p>First, the First Amendment is generally held not to apply to private companies.</p><p>Second, section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act explicitly states that \"interactive computer services\" are not publishers (so, unlike newspapers, they can't be held responsible for bad stuff that appears on their platforms), but they also cannot be \"held liable on account of \u2026 any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" (so they can't be accused of restricting free speech when they delete bad stuff ).</p><p>To call section 230 - which was enacted when the internet was in its infancy - an anachronism would be an understatement. It would be more accurate to say that it is the Catch-22 of our time, in that big tech firms are not publishers when harm arises from the content on their platforms, but they are publishers when they engage in censorship. Either way, they have minimal legal liability.</p><p>Yet section 230 (a) (3) explicitly assumed online platforms would \"offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse\". And the phrase \"or otherwise objectionable\" was never intended to cover political positions.</p><p>These days, in Washington, there is a great deal of discussion of \"breaking up big tech\" by resuscitating or reforming competition law. Other voices (including, suspiciously, the big tech companies) clamour for more regulation. But the free-speech crisis can and should be simply addressed. The network platforms handle far too much content to be effective publishers. They are entitled to section 230's protection - but only if they uphold the diversity of discourse envisaged by Congress.</p><p>The alternative is to repeal section 230 and impose on big tech something like a First Amendment obligation not to limit free speech. Speaking as one of the last surviving members of the freespeech party, I'd prefer that second option. But either would be an improvement on that geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford</p><p>\"Companies such as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-150012795</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W99-XBJ1-DYTY-C0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1210\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 9, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

On Wednesday, as The New York Times reported, \"numerous far-right creators began complaining that their videos had been deleted or had been stripped of ads, presumably a result of the new policy\".</p><p>As if to test YouTube out, a Vox journalist named Carlos Maza demanded that it ban Steven Crowder, the host of a raucous political show, on the grounds that Crowder had repeatedly made homophobic jokes about him. \"I've been called an anchor baby, a lispy queer, a Mexican, etc,\" Maza wrote on Twitter. At first, YouTube resisted, arguing that Crowder hadn't violated the company's terms of service, but soon - partly under pressure from other employees of Google, its owner - it folded, announcing that it had \"suspended this channel's monetisation ... because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community\".</p><p>I knew nothing of either Maza or Crowder until last week. The point of this column is not to defend the latter or the obnoxious \"Socialism is for fags\" T-shirt he sometimes wears on his show. The point I want to make is the more general one that free speech on the internet is in free fall.</p><p>Crowder has company. The co-founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, also had his YouTube presence restricted this year. Last month, Facebook banned not only the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but also the alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the white supremacist Paul Nehlen, the African-American Muslim zealot Louis Farrakhan and the national activist Laura Loomer.</p><p>And those are just the better-known names. In a recent report, Facebook boasted that the proportion of hate speech it found \"proactively\" - before users reported it - had risen to 65% in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Having previously confined themselves to removing paedophile and terrorist content, the big tech companies are now openly engaged in political censorship. Google admits as much: an internal presentation last March was actually entitled \"The Good Censor\". What this means in practice is that tens of thousands of content moderators such as young Adam are deciding what you can and cannot see online.</p><p>Here's another of them, talking to Silicon Valley lawyer Alex Feerst: \"I was like, 'I can just block this entire domain, and they won't be able to serve ads on it?' And the answer was, 'Yes.' I was like, 'But ... I'm in my mid-twenties.' \" In Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's vision of the future was \"a boot stamping on a human face - for ever\". In 2019, it turns out to be a geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>You may not care for any of the people I have mentioned thus far. You might still not care if I tell you that interviews my wife and I have done (for, respectively, the US online broadcasters Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin) have been \"demonetised\" by YouTube, meaning that advertisements were not associated with them and therefore Prager and Rubin could not earn money from them. The point is not who gets censored or demonetised. The point is that companies as big and ubiquitous as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power. Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees that \"we have too much power over speech\".</p><p>When so many people now read an article such as this after being directed to it by one or other of the tech platforms, it is true to say that the platforms are, in the words of recently retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy, \"the modern public square\". Yet they are emphatically not acting in that spirit - unless it was Tiananmen Square Kennedy had in mind.</p><p>Remember, the First Amendment to the US constitution bars Congress from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\", and the Supreme Court has allowed few exceptions. Much more than in Europe, US courts are reluctant to penalise speech, even when plaintiffs allege defamation, invasion of privacy or emotional distress.</p><p>But none of this applies online, where (in the words of two legal scholars) the big tech companies can \"act as legislature, executive, judiciary and press\". For they are doubly protected. First, the First Amendment is generally held not to apply to private companies. Second, section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act explicitly states that \"interactive computer services\" are not publishers (so, unlike newspapers, they can't be held responsible for bad stuff that appears on their platforms), but they also cannot be \"held liable on account of ... any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" (so they can't be accused of restricting free speech when they delete bad stuff ). To call section 230 - which was enacted when the internet was in its infancy - an anachronism would be an understatement. It would be more accurate to say that it is the Catch-22 of our time, in that the big tech firms are not publishers when harm arises from the content on their platforms, but are publishers when they engage in censorship. Either way, they have minimal legal liability.</p><p>Yet section 230 (a) (3) explicitly assumed online platforms would \"offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse\". And the phrase \"or otherwise objectionable\" was never intended to cover political positions.</p><p>These days, in Washington, there is a great deal of discussion of \"breaking up big tech\" by resuscitating or reforming competition law. Other voices (including, suspiciously, the big tech companies) clamour for more regulation. But the free-speech crisis can and should be simply addressed. The network platforms handle far too much content to be effective publishers. They are entitled to section 230's protection - but only if they uphold the diversity of discourse envisaged by Congress.</p><p>The alternative is to repeal section 230 and impose on big tech something like a First Amendment obligation not to limit free speech. Speaking as one of the last surviving members of the free-speech party, I'd prefer that second option. But either would be an improvement on that geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>Niall Ferguson is the Milbank Family senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford</p><p>Companies such as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-150006569</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W99-XBJ1-DYTY-C1PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1211\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 9, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Heck, I can even remember John Perry Barlow's hippie-libertarian \"A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace\" - a place \"where anyone, anywhere, may express his or her beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, \"it's the morning after the freespeech party, and the place is trashed\". Don't take it from me. Those words come from twentysomething Adam, a content moderator in one of the \"trust and safety teams\" now employed by Facebook, Google and the other network platforms to detect and remove \"hate speech\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last week, YouTube announced that it was \"specifically prohibiting videos alleging that a group is superior in order to justify discrimination, segregation or exclusion based on qualities like age, gender, race, caste, religion, sexual orientation or veteran status\". It swiftly became clear what that meant in practice. On Wednesday, as The New York Times reported, \"numerous far-right creators began complaining that their videos had been deleted or had been stripped of ads, presumably a result of the new policy\".</p><p>As if to test YouTube out, a Vox journalist named Carlos Maza demanded that it ban Steven Crowder, the host of a raucous political show, on the grounds that Crowder had repeatedly made homophobic jokes about him. \"I've been called an anchor baby, a lispy queer, a Mexican, etc,\" Maza wrote on Twitter. At first, YouTube resisted, arguing that Crowder hadn't violated the company's terms of service, but soon - partly under pressure from other employees of Google, its owner - it folded, announcing that it had \"suspended this channel's monetisation ... because a pattern of egregious actions has harmed the broader community\".</p><p>I knew nothing of either Maza or Crowder until last week. The point of this column is not to defend the latter or the obnoxious \"Socialism is for fags\" T-shirt he sometimes wears on his show. The point I want to make is the more general one that free speech on the internet is in free fall.</p><p>Crowder has company. The co-founder of the English Defence League, Tommy Robinson, also had his YouTube presence restricted this year. Last month, Facebook banned not only the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones but also the alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos, the white supremacist Paul Nehlen, the African-American Muslim zealot Louis Farrakhan and the national activist Laura Loomer.</p><p>And those are just the better-known names. In a recent report, Facebook boasted that the proportion of hate speech it found \"proactively\" - before users reported it - had risen to 65% in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>Having previously confined themselves to removing paedophile and terrorist content, the big tech companies are now openly engaged in political censorship. Google admits as much: an internal presentation last March was actually entitled \"The Good Censor\". What this means in practice is that tens of thousands of content moderators such as young Adam are deciding what you can and cannot see online.</p><p>Here's another of them, talking to Silicon Valley lawyer Alex Feerst: \"I was like, 'I can just block this entire domain, and they won't be able to serve ads on it?' And the answer was, 'Yes.' I was like, 'But ... I'm in my mid-twenties.' \" In Nineteen Eighty-Four, George Orwell's vision of the future was \"a boot stamping on a human face - for ever\". In 2019, it turns out to be a geek hitting \"delete\" on a keyboard for ever.</p><p>You may not care for any of the people I have mentioned thus far. You might still not care if I tell you that interviews my wife and I have done (for, respectively, the US online broadcasters Dennis Prager and Dave Rubin) have been \"demonetised\" by YouTube, meaning that advertisements were not associated with them and therefore Prager and Rubin could not earn money from them. The point is not who gets censored or demonetised. The point is that companies as big and ubiquitous as Google and Facebook should not have this kind of power. Even Mark Zuckerberg agrees that \"we have too much power over speech\".</p><p>When so many people now read an article such as this after being directed to it by one or other of the tech platforms, it is true to say that the platforms are, in the words of recently retired Supreme Court justice Anthony Kennedy, \"the modern public square\". Yet they are emphatically not acting in that spirit - unless it was Tiananmen Square Kennedy had in mind.</p><p>Remember, the First Amendment to the US constitution bars Congress from \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press\", and the Supreme Court has allowed few exceptions. Much more than in Europe, US courts are reluctant to penalise speech, even when plaintiffs allege defamation, invasion of privacy or emotional distress.</p><p>But none of this applies online, where (in the words of two legal scholars) the big tech companies can \"act as legislature, executive, judiciary and press\". For they are doubly protected. First, the First Amendment is generally held not to apply to private companies. Second, section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act explicitly states that \"interactive computer services\" are not publishers (so, unlike newspapers, they can't be held responsible for bad stuff that appears on their platforms), but they also cannot be \"held liable on account of ...</p><p>any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that [they] consider to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable\" (so they can't be accused of restricting free speech when they delete bad stuff ). To call section 230 - which was enacted when the internet was in its infancy - an anachronism would be an understatement. It would be more accurate to say that it is the Catch-22 of our time, in that the big tech firms are not publishers when harm arises from the content on their platforms, but are publishers when they engage in censorship. Either way, they have minimal legal liability.</p><p>Yet section 230 (a) (3) explicitly assumed online platforms would \"offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse\". And the phrase \"or otherwise objectionable\" was never intended to cover political positions.</p><p>These days, in Washington, there is a great deal of discussion of \"breaking up big tech\" by resuscitating or reforming competition law.

We have experiences ranging from in-school banking with money boxes, and a savings culture drilled into us, through to card-carrying wallets without cash but for the utilisation of credit/debit cards.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That is now transiting to smartphone pay systems such as Applepay, which I believe encourages a lack of monetary discipline. The next step is not far away, and the rate of change is speeding up.  </p><p>In fact, I believe the only thing restraining more rapid advancement in many areas is our psychological inability to cope with the speed of change. For example, the older members of our tribe are technologically semi-literate, while the 24-year-old is approaching genius level. It is wearying, hearing, ?(EURO)oeout of the way, let me do it?(EURO).  </p><p>There is another reason, I suggest, that there is more profit to be made by staggering advances.  </p><p>Most individuals, and therefore societies, can cope with only moderate incremental change. If we had access to the research and development divisions of big tech companies, we might be horrified at where a quantum leap would take us.  </p><p>Recently, I read a quote indicating that science fiction writers are a better guide to the future than non-fiction writings.  </p><p>What led me down this path was a commentary on the nomination of Joe Biden as a Democrat candidate for the American presidency. Holman W. Jenkins Jr, in the Wall Street Journal, wrote ?(EURO)oeJoe Biden centred his rationale for running on a claim that Donald Trump referred to racists and neo-nazis in Charlottesville, as very fine people. Mr Biden probably is not connected enough to social media to know it, but this claim has been thoroughly defeated by pushback, led by Dilbert creator Scott Adams and others.?(EURO)  </p><p>Jenkins is correct. I raise this not because of the politics involved but to exemplify the serious influence social media can have. Jenkins quotes Jake Tapper from CNN, and the Washington Post as endorsement.  </p><p>Most recently, Facebook has permanently banned a number of unacceptable users of its services.  </p><p>?(EURO)oeDangerous?(EURO) was the summation of their sites. Alex Jones, his media company Infowars, Laura Loomer, Paul Nehler, Paul Joseph Watson, Milo Yiannopoulos and Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam.  </p><p>I am unfamiliar with a couple of them and will miss none of them. I don?(EURO)(TM)t do Facebook or Twitter.  </p><p>But it is irrelevant what I or anyone else think of these individuals. The question is why their opinions should be curtailed.  </p><p>The one that intrigues me most is Louis Farrakhan, a most detestable individual. His connections with Democrats like Maxine Waters and others are public, as is a photo of Farrakhan with Obama. Recently he shared a stage with Bill Clinton.  </p><p>A long time back I argued against allowing anti-Semite and holocaust denier David Irving into New Zealand for a speaking tour.  </p><p>A protagonist talkback caller responded that it was better to defeat the likes of Irving by debating with superior argument. Trouble is, better arguments don?(EURO)(TM)t necessarily win the day. There may be many countervailing factors.  </p><p>Here?(EURO)(TM)s an obvious example. In an election campaign it is down to the wire in the final television debate between two prime ministerial candidates.  </p><p>One presents undeniable facts and reasons in a logical way but is dull. The other is not so well-versed in the points but is charismatic and emotively convincing.  </p><p>In a world where concentration span is short, where feelings outrank logic, would it be surprising if candidate two was the victor?  </p><p>I was raised that first impressions are the most important. That may seem obvious but there is a part two. Those first impressions may be quite wrong and disestablishing them can sometimes be futile. We have all experienced it, probably on both sides of a discussion.  </p><p>Should big tech be regulated? Particularly because of Christchurch and then Sri Lanka, there is much discussion about what to do with big tech and social media.  </p><p>Are global standards on big tech required? How does social media affect mental health? Should companies like Microsoft and Facebook, Amazon and Apple be subject to legislation before the united corporations of Silicon Valley control the world?  </p><p>It will be telling who Facebook takes out next, for politics is the driving factor. Internet creator Tim Berners Lee said it had evolved into: ?(EURO)oeAn engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agenda.?(EURO)  </p><p>How about, instead, freeing up the market by returning to laissez-faire basics. Maybe then there would be a healthier, more competitive market place.  </p><p>Social media is neither good nor bad. It is the use to which it is put that matters. Just like guns and cars and ... words.  </p><p>And one final question to ponder. Is Berners Lee right? Can democracy survive global capitalism?      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHWkoleighton11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W30-MWC1-JDK8-V07T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"842\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

As well as being easily offended, he was a mighty warrior when it came to matters of trade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He had much to be furious about at the turn of the 17th century. The ever-changing constitutional question gave Ireland and England the same king - which meant government then - but two kingdoms. The English used that difference to try to kill any Irish products which competed with theirs, even in overseas trade. Swift's call for retaliation - \"Burn everything English, except their coal\" - may be his best-known quotation, in Ireland at least. We have not heard it used much this time, although it was the popular mantra during the Anglo-Irish \"economic war\" of 1932.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Of course, we do not have a trade war - as yet - just plenty of patriotism. A better quote for current Irish policy might be the late John Healy's description of the economic war: \"When the farmers killed the calves for Dev.\"</p><p>The Anglo-Irish \"war\" was not about trade either. It was about who should pay compensation to landlords for the compulsory purchase of their estates in the 19th century, but it ended up in trade retaliation, especially on agriculture.</p><p>If the UK should leave with no deal and end up under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules, it would not be because a trade war has erupted between Britain and the EU. But the effect would be the same.</p><p>Elsewhere in the world, trade is again dangerous politically. Those 17th century English merchants may have been unkind, but they were using what seems like common sense - protecting their business against foreign competition. Today, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping would agree with them, one openly and the other surreptitiously.</p><p>Standard economic theory holds that, on this at least, common sense is misleading. Overall, it says, we are better off if trade is not restricted by tariffs, quotas and regulations. In its new World Economic Outlook, IMF analysts cite both technology and open trade for the startling statistic that a computer which cost $30,000 in 1984 would cost $300 today.</p><p>The EU has applied these ideas to a unique degree with the creation of the customs union and single market - although it was inspired by much more than free trade theory. The consequences are the same though, whatever the motivation. Some of them overturn common sense a bit too.</p><p>The controversially topical speech by President Michael D Higgins on the nature of the EU is a product of this. Like many others, he sees a bias in favour of business and finance in the make-up of the EU. He seems to regard this as a deliberate choice, inspired by the power of money. Some of it undoubtedly is, but much else is unavoidable. One cannot have free markets without a lot of freedom for business, or have free movement of workers without some freedom for employers to hire and fire.</p><p>The EU's system for keeping markets open and fair throughout the union is well tried and tested.</p><p>But turn the glass one way, and it looks like rampant capitalism which knows no frontiers. Turned the other way, there is a great Brussels bureaucracy stifling enterprise.</p><p>One of the many strange things about the UK debate is that there have been relatively few direct attacks on the EU system itself. It has been more a case of whether Britain needs Europe more than Europe needs Britain.</p><p>The most the Leave campaign can come up with is that Britain will do better outside the EU, rather than a ridiculous claim that is has been positively harmed by membership of the single market.</p><p>Outside Europe, 17th century common sense is re-asserting itself. Free trade is increasingly seen as foreigners taking advantage of one's generosity. The old slogans of buying less abroad and making more at home are back in vogue.</p><p>Those slogans had their heyday in the 1930s and into the 1950s. Since then, freeing up trade has been one of the great agents of change. That computer price is just an extreme example of what the IMF analysts say is a 60pc fall in the price of machinery and equipment relative to the overall cost of consumption in the past 30 years.</p><p>They believe that trade integration - in particular the growth of multi-national supply chains - has been the biggest factor behind the falling prices. The extraordinary integration of the EU has been laid bare by the attempted Brexit dis-integration, but the same process has been at work everywhere.</p><p>The arguments over the effects of free trade and globalisation often miss one important point - that they have been of enormous advantage to those on lower incomes. In rich countries, the dramatic fall in the real prices of manufactured goods, from baby buggies to high-definition televisions, has been a major boost to living standards.</p><p>In developing economies, especially in Asia, the effects have been even more dramatic. Tens of millions have moved from near-starvation subsistence levels based on agriculture to western standards of prosperity.</p><p>But no one now disputes there have been losers as well. The doughty champions of free trade at the IMF concede that globalisation must be accompanied by enhanced social protection and training for displaced workers to mitigate the downside.</p><p>There may be more to it than redundant industrial workers. The market power of large companies has increased, not diminished, as proponents of open trade hoped would happen through greater competition.</p><p>The big tech companies are the obvious example, but at least they have certain unique characteristics. Market concentration is evident in other sectors too, on a scale great enough to worry central bankers because it may make interest rate policy less effective.</p><p>Market power may also reduce the effectiveness of the mano a mano trade policies favoured by President Trump. A comprehensive study in the IMF report looks at the effect of tariffs imposed by one country on the goods of another since 1990.</p><p>It finds that, while tariffs may affect the bilateral trade balance, it does not change the overall balance of the country in question. Companies simply shift their supply lines elsewhere to avoid the new duties.</p><p>That's the balance, but the volume of trade may indeed fall. In its new report, the WTO reduced its estimate for growth in world trade last year by a third, to 3pc. Its forecast range for this year is from a low of 1.3pc to a high of 4pc, with the risks tilted towards the lower end.</p><p>Trade tensions, especially between the USA and China, get the major part of the blame. European attitudes to Chinese policies are also hardening. If these trends continue, multinational firms may find supply chains too widely disrupted to let them overcome restrictions as readily as they did in the past 30 years, when markets in general were becoming more open rather than closed.</p><p>The EU needs to think about these issues when it comes to its own internal affairs. The single market, and even more the single currency, tend to disguise the imbalances between member states and keep them out of the political debates.</p><p>Actions since the euro crisis have reduced those imbalances through changes in domestic polices, since tariffs are not allowed. According to the IMF analysis, that is more effective anyway. However, they have largely been policies of restricting consumption in the deficit countries rather than improving productivity.</p><p>That may not be sustainable. It is a great achievement that one EU country cannot deliberately restrict sales from another. It would be an even greater achievement if surplus member states could be persuaded that the others need to be given competitive advantages, as well as creating their own, to enable them sell more. On that basis, perhaps Dean Swift should have said \"burn English coal more efficiently\" - only he would have found a much better way to say it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Trade tensions between Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping get the blame for an expected reduction in the growth of world trade</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-148228750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW0-D9P1-JCBW-N4JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1303\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 11, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000D2U3</classCode><className>TALLGRASS ENERGY CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC1321 NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp;

A friend reminisced about how, when he was their age - ten or so - he used to play down on the Dart tracks at the bottom of his garden. We all laughed: it sounded both idyllically carefree and wantonly dangerous. Upstairs, the children were playing away, on Snapchat and Youtube and Musical.ly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 30 years, they will reminisce and laugh about these times that will seem to them both idyllically carefree and wantonly dangerous. They will marvel at the freedom they (and the world) had online, and be horrified at the threats that freedom contained.</p><p>They may view 2018 as the year in which that started to change. The year in which internet companies began to find themselves subject to a new level of accountability; in which the balance of freedom and safety online began to tilt back in favour of safety. The question is: will they celebrate that change, or lament it?</p><p>The headline dangers online are well documented but, for most of us, essentially abstract: we know there are paedophiles, child pornographers and terrorist recruiters out there, but we don\u2019t go looking for them and they don\u2019t come looking for us.</p><p>We know that the music-streaming services and YouTube have cannibalised the music industry, and that Google and Facebook have cannibalised the news media, but we like this new freedom to consume music and news for free, and we can no longer envisage the alternative.</p><p>We have seen people have their reputations destroyed on social media, but most of us haven\u2019t done anything that anyone could use against us and don\u2019t see why we would be at risk.</p><p>For the most part, we enjoy the upside of internet freedom without needing to worry about the downside. But recently, because of my kids, I\u2019ve begun to worry about the downside.</p><p>In the changing room at the swimming pool, another child took a photo of my ten-year-old daughter while she was undressing, for Snapchat. My daughter wasn\u2019t upset, and the photo doesn\u2019t seem to have gone anywhere; no harm was done.</p><p>What alarmed me was the discrepancy between the ease (and innocence) of the act and the scale of the harm it could potentially do. There is nothing new about teasing or bullying; social media, though, is transformative of their power.</p><p>Snapchat can be used as a weapon; to my daughter and her friends, though, it is first and foremost a tool of both friendship and tribal belonging, one through which they can test and adopt social norms.</p><p>This is what kids do: they enact rituals of play and community, learning from each other. But, again, social media transforms this: it accelerates and intensifies these rituals.</p><p>Any child can get a cheap make-up set for Christmas. But Snapchat allows them to airbrush themselves in real time; they can look in their phone screen and see an idealised version of themselves smile back, skin smoothed and eyelashes lengthened. And then they can send that version out into the world and watch as their peers appraise it.</p><p>To comply with US law, most of these social media companies say users must be 13 or over. To get around this, children merely give a fake date of birth. In other words, some of the world\u2019s most powerful technology companies are daily being hacked by vast hordes of under-13s.</p><p>Because all the parents we know are experiencing this at the same time, it is easy to forget how strange it is. It\u2019s easy to take it for granted; to simply assume there\u2019s nothing we can do about it.</p><p>But there\u2019s plenty we can do about it \u2013 we\u2019ve just decided not to. In the early days of this industry, internet companies successfully argued that they were \u201cmere conduits\u201d for the content on their services, like the postal service and telephone network, and so could not be held liable for that content.</p><p>If that was at least debatable then, it has become increasingly dubious since, as these companies displaced the income streams of traditional publishers and became the repositories for much of their content. And as these companies invested more resources in monetising that content (which means curating it), their claims to be mere conduits became delusional.</p><p>In the meantime, monetising that content made them extraordinarily rich. Google\u2019s revenue last year was $79 billion, up by 22 per cent. Facebook\u2019s revenue for the first nine months of 2017 was $28 billion, up by 47 per cent. These are the most successful media companies in history. And that success is partly because they have abrogated the key (and expensive) responsibilities of media companies for their content and to their audience.</p><p>The high watermark of this hubris came early last year, when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg released a 5,700-word manifesto announcing that Facebook would now seek to build a \u201cglobal safety infrastructure\u201d that would help solve \u201cproblems like terrorism, natural disasters, disease, refugee crises and climate change\u201d.</p><p>But the solutions to these problems are political. Facebook can only help solve them if it is willing to get political; if it does, it will be the greatest political machine the world has ever seen. That could make its failings thus far \u2013 largely the predictable outcomes of under-regulated profit-seeking - seem positively benign.</p><p>Yet even as Big Tech\u2019s ambition expands, the forces are massing against it. Influential voices across the political spectrum in the US, from Al Franken to Steve Bannon, have decried its market dominance and called for increased regulation.</p><p>In Germany, a new law came into force on January 1 imposing harsh penalties for online fake news and hate speech. In France, president Emmanuel Macron said last week that he would bring in strong new legislation to combat fake news. In Britain, a parliamentary committee last month recommended that social media companies be made liable for their content.</p><p>These things need to happen.

I'm told it pays to advertise, so please subscribe to this fine newsletter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Free YouTube (and Instagram)!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's time to set YouTube free.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Since 2006, when Google paid $1.65 billion for the tiny video startup, YouTube has belonged to the search operator. Even when Google Inc. renamed itself Alphabet in 2015, it kept YouTube as part of Google rather than setting it up a standalone subsidiary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Monday, for the first time, Alphabet revealed just how much money YouTube was making: $15 billion from ads alone. YouTube also sells internet-TV subscriptions; that figure was lumped into another line on Alphabet's financials, so YouTube's true size is even bigger.</p><p>Instagram, which Facebook bought in 2012 for a cool $1 billion (the final purchase price wobbled along with Facebook's stock price, but let's stick with the round number for now), could be even bigger than YouTube. Bloomberg reported Tuesday that Instagram brought in more than $20 billion in advertising revenue in 2019, making up more than a quarter of Facebook's $70.7 billion in revenue for the year.</p><p> Legal thinkers, regulators and Democratic presidential contenders have been calling for some kind of big-tech breakup to rein in the internet giants. The newly released financial figures point to the cleanest, simplest way to do that.</p><p> The company line is that being part of a bigger whole brings benefits. Facebook argues that Instagram benefits from its expertise fighting spam, fraud and abuse. YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki has said that the video service makes use of Google's machine learning prowess to identify clips that violate its rules.</p><p> I call B.S. \u2014 that's short for BillionS. Nurtured within Facebook and Google, Instagram and YouTube have more than enough revenue to pay their own way. Freed of their parent companies, they might well be more able to experiment with new abuse-fighting techniques.</p><p>Google and Facebook might be forced to innovate, too. Without YouTube, Google could find itself motivated to find other places to sell video ads, which would help a range of video producers. Facebook would have to improve its photo-sharing features, as advertisers increasingly flock to Instagram's commerce-friendly photo feed. (Maybe try something besides copying Snapchat for a change?)</p><p> The other complaint Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made is that if American internet companies are constrained, Chinese firms will take their place. He's wrong there, too. Instagram and YouTube would instantly be among the biggest internet companies, and surely America would be better off with more multibillion-dollar tech companies rather than fewer. The next rung of social media companies do not look like fierce contenders. Analysts estimate that Twitter will report about $2.5 billion in annual revenue for 2019; Snap Inc., which makes Snapchat, had $1.7 billion, while Pinterest is forecasting around $1.1 billion for the year.</p><p> One other aspect of an Instagram spinoff appeals to me. The company was started by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger in San Francisco, and returned in 2018 with an office in 181 Fremont, though it's still housed in Facebook's Menlo Park office. CEO Adam Mosseri lives in San Francisco. What if an independent Instagram were to take its place among San Francisco's tech companies \u2014 and give Zuckerberg a run for his money? I like that picture.</p><p> \u2014 Owen Thomas, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:othomas@sfchronicle.com\">othomas@sfchronicle.com</email></p><p> Quote of the week</p><p> \"If somebody doesn't know that what they're about to try to share on Twitter is altered, or they're unaware of that, we want to try to give them that information.\"  \u2014 Twitter safety chief Del Harvey, explaining the company's new policy against manipulated videos known as \"deepfakes\"</p><p> Coming up</p><p> Speaking of Twitter and Pinterest, both companies report earnings Thursday, along with Uber.</p><p> What I'm reading</p><p> Ryan Mac on the curious silence among tech companies that vocally opposed President Trump's travel ban after its expansion to more countries.

A recent action by the French competition authority (ADC) may be one such event.Specifically, the ADC has launched a public consultation on the fintech sector in France[1], in particular with regard to payment services. The consultation focuses on the two types of new players in the payments space: (1) the role of big digital platforms and (2) the effect of smaller innovative payment service providers on competition in the financial services sector.The objective is to better understand to what extent new and emerging players and services are complementary or competing with traditional banking services and to identify where competition may be dysfunctional. </p><p>And of course, these new and emerging players\u2014as with the services they offer\u2014are almost always cross-border in nature.The feedback from the consultation will feed into an opinion of the ADC on future regulation and/or enforcement in the fintech and digital payments space. It is therefore an excellent opportunity for all market players (large and small, established or starting up) to convey key messages and have their say as future regulation is in the making. The deadline for comments is June 19.Context of the ConsultationThe consultation echoes the European Commission's monitoring of mobile payments services as well as the Dutch competition authority's review of activities of big tech companies in the Dutch payments market.New Players and New TechnologyGrowing use of smartphones and the internet of things has changed consumer demand. The ADC notes that this has led to two types of new market entry in the digital payments space. On the one hand, a whole range of small firms are offering innovative services, often at lower cost. On the other hand, large players in the digital space that are already established in France have started offering payments services. Cloud storage and blockchain technology have led to the arrival of new services on the market, such as electronic wallets or cryptoassets. The ADC is seeking to understand how this broadly affects competition in the area of payments space.Reaction of BanksThe ADC is also looking at the various ways traditional banking players have adapted to this evolution. Banks have reacted very differently; some are acquiring fintech players or setting up fintech services providers themselves, some have entered cooperation or partnership agreements with fintech providers, and others are simply investing into R&amp;#38;D. The regulator seeks views in particular on the acquisition of fintech players by banking groups in France.Scope of the ConsultationThe relatively short consultation consists of a set of 12 questions around three areas.Understanding Technological Developments in the SectorThe ADC is seeking very general views from the market on the entry of smaller and larger fintech players, the acquisition of smaller players by banking groups, and the impact of cloud and blockchain technology on the sector.Delimiting Markets and Identifying Competitive AdvantagesWith its second set of questions, the ADC is seeking more targeted feedback on whether new entrants are perceived as competitors of traditional banks or rather as complementing their offerings, what factors make up competitive advantages for players in the markets, and which players might already hold such advantages or even have a strong market power.Commercial PracticesThe final set of questions asks respondents to provide general feedback on any malfunctioning of competition in the fintech space as a result of the application of new technologies to payments services, and also more specifically, with regard to cryptoassets, blockchain, or cloud technologies, respectively.SignificanceParticipation in the ADC consultation is voluntary, but it is a classic tool for competition agencies and other regulators to review a market before passing to regulatory or enforcement measures or both. It is therefore a prime opportunity for any market player to convey key messages and have their say as future regulation in the fintech and digital payments space is in the making.In particular, the delimitation of markets, evaluation of key competitive advantages, and the identification of impediments to the proper functioning of competition in fintech will set the base line for future action by the regulator. Players are well advised to participate in where this line will be drawn. The deadline for comments to the ADC is June 19.While the ADC consultation is limited to France, it provides an instructive example of a national regulator taking the initiative to learn and understand a continuously expanding and vital segment of the financial services industry. Although the ADC is limiting its inquiry into competition issues, this type of regulatory initiative is something that could\u2014and perhaps should\u2014be readily replicated in other jurisdictions.In Europe, the ADC is not the only competition agency and the results of its consultation will be shared in the network of European competition agencies (ECN). In turn, we can expect to see further efforts by national and international regulatory bodies to come to grips with the financial, economic, and regulatory aspects of fintech activities through proactive regulatory efforts such as this.[View source[2].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/article/fintechs-sector-inquiry-autorite-launches-public-consultation\">https://www.autoritedelaconcurrence.fr/en/article/fintechs-sector-inquiry-autorite-launches-public-consultation</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/finreg/2020/05/french-competition-authority-consults-on-fintech-and-digital-payments-sector\">https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/finreg/2020/05/french-competition-authority-consults-on-fintech-and-digital-payments-sector</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411159051636276575776100180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600G-39H1-F03R-N3KH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"984\"/><timeReceived>6:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 26, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Search engines like Google would be forced to stop linking to the controversial content as well.The coverage written so far did not address whether this will mean a removal merely in France or worldwide.The Washington Post published an Associated Press piece[1] claiming the provision 'targets videos or messages inciting or glorifying terrorism, hate, violence, or racist or religious abuse. Violators could face hefty fines.'Naturally, this has only added fuel to the fiery debate over what qualifies as 'hate speech' and who will be the arbiter of content.The New York Times[2] cited a French lawyer Christophe Bigot who specializes in media. </p><p>He wrote an op-ed for Le Figaro[3] condemning the legislation's potential for 'censorship.' He specifically condemned the fact that this will be overseen by tech companies 'without the involvement of judges 'who are the constitutional guarantors of fundamental freedoms.' The New York Times observed how Mr. Bigot recounted 'several examples of free-speech issues that tech companies would find difficult to settle in less than 24 hours.'This comes after the Paris Call as well as the Christchurch Call[4] for tech censorship.The Christchurch Call came in the wake of the horrific New Zealand terrorist attack. Numerous Big Tech companies and countries such as U.K, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, and Sweden signed on to the proposal.The United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, characteristically suspicious of the slippery slope that would threaten free speech, refused to join.The United States recently held a House Homeland Security Committee hearing[5] about 'terrorist activity' where Big Tech representatives were questioned by leaders from both sides of the political spectrum.Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) observed how these tech companies benefited from American exceptionalism yet were failing in their obligation 'to enforce american values and the First Amendment is an underpinning of american value that we should be protecting until the day we die.'Former ACLU president Nadine Strossen addressed how problematic the very idea was of Big Tech companies regulating hate speech. She referred to these 'so-called' standards' as 'irreducibly subjective.' She hammered home her point by addressing how one person's hate speech may be another person's sincerely held religious belief.

Search engines like Google would be forced to stop linking to the controversial content as well.The coverage written so far did not address whether this will mean a removal merely in France or worldwide.The Washington Post published an Associated Press piece[1] claiming the provision 'targets videos or messages inciting or glorifying terrorism, hate, violence, or racist or religious abuse. Violators could face hefty fines.'Naturally, this has only added fuel to the fiery debate over what qualifies as 'hate speech' and who will be the arbiter of content.The New York Times[2] cited a French lawyer Christophe Bigot who specializes in media. </p><p>He wrote an op-ed for Le Figaro[3] condemning the legislation's potential for 'censorship.' He specifically condemned the fact that this will be overseen by tech companies 'without the involvement of judges 'who are the constitutional guarantors of fundamental freedoms.' The New York Times observed how Mr. Bigot recounted 'several examples of free-speech issues that tech companies would find difficult to settle in less than 24 hours.'This comes after the Paris Call as well as the Christchurch Call[4] for tech censorship.The Christchurch Call came in the wake of the horrific New Zealand terrorist attack. Numerous Big Tech companies and countries such as U.K, Germany, France, Norway, Spain, and Sweden signed on to the proposal.The United States, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, characteristically suspicious of the slippery slope that would threaten free speech, refused to join.The United States recently held a House Homeland Security Committee hearing[5] about 'terrorist activity' where Big Tech representatives were questioned by leaders from both sides of the political spectrum.Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) observed how these tech companies benefited from American exceptionalism yet were failing in their obligation 'to enforce american values and the First Amendment is an underpinning of american value that we should be protecting until the day we die.'Former ACLU president Nadine Strossen addressed how problematic the very idea was of Big Tech companies regulating hate speech. She referred to these 'so-called' standards' as 'irreducibly subjective.'
