And if the Democrats are going to be fair and balanced about this they should be equally concerned about what <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>did or didn't in her role as attorney general.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: A closer look at whether Lynch interfered with the Clinton e- mail investigation later this hour.</p><p>A scary scene at a California motel -- a car crashing through a brick wall and into a pool filled with children and at least eight people injured.</p><p><person><nameText>Martin Shkreli </nameText></person>heads to court -- jury selection for his fraud trial gets underway today but he's already ignoring his lawyer's advice. We have the details ahead.</p><p>Plus <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>has his eyes on the sky -- Amazon has a new patent for its delivery drones. The latest on his growing empire coming up.</p><p>Futures pointing to gains at the open -- you can take a look. Gains across the board, 64-point gain on the Dow futures right here right now. The Nasdaq composite on track for its eighth month gain -- eight months in a row. If you can believe it.</p><p>In Europe, we have buying across the board as well -- in England, France and Germany.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, same story -- green across that screen.</p><p>And celebrating 20 years of Harry Potter -- the book hitting shelves 20 years ago today and Facebook is getting in on the festivities.</p><p>All that and so much more coming up this morning. Maslansky and Partners' president Lee Carter, market strategist Kevin Kelly and CFRA investment strategist Lindsey Bell. Lindsey -- what do you make of these markets? Impressive.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: It's very impressive. Also a little bit worrisome given the run that we have had. We're up almost 9 percent year to date. That's usually what you get in one year on a good year. So I'm a little bit worried about what's going on in Washington and how that could impact the markets because usually in the second half of the year, starting August you start -- there's a seasonal trade down.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Nasdaq eight -- on track for its eighth straight monthly gain -- the longest winning streak in as long as you've alive. 22 years</p><p>KEVIN KELLY, CIO, RECON CAPITAL: Love it, baby. Well yes, that's an interesting point. I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You missed that.</p><p>KELLY: I know -- I am 22. I love celebrating my second annual 21st birth day just a while ago. The best part is that technology has almost -- it performed double that what the overall market has. And so that's the interesting aspect because it's leading it so technology is correlated to the overall market 93 percent. So where technology goes, the market is going to go. So it's largest sector of the S&amp;P 500 but I think the interesting --</p><p>MCDOWELL: The longer the banks leading the way -- right.</p><p>KELLY: -- right. The interesting aspect, though, that we are not talking about is the ten-year treasury is now at about 2.15 percent.</p><p>BELL: Yes.</p><p>KELLY: And so that's a crazy signal. So that's something to watch. I would have never predicted that when we started the year especially with the fed raising interest rates.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And just one thing about the tech stocks -- that market fell off and big tech names June 9th to the 12th that Facebook is now the first of those tech titans to recover from that selloff. The other ones Amazon, Netflix, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft are still down from that selloff.</p><p>We have so much more to discuss this morning. Coming up, one of our favorite people on the planet Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano, the 2008 Clinton campaign chief strategist Mark Penn, and Fortnum and Mason CEO Ewan Venters is also here, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney joins as well.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of those fine gentlemen.</p><p>Returning to our top story this hour, Ohio Governor John Kasich's official Web site, one of several government Web sites lacked with pro-ISIS messages. The message reads, quote, \"You will be held accountable, Trump; you and all your people for every drop of blood flow from Muslim countries.\" A hacker group called Team System DZ is taking responsibility for the messages.</p><p>Joining me now is conservative columnist Dr. Gina Loudon on what you make of this hack. Good morning -- Gina.</p><p>GINA LOUDEN, CONSERVATIVE COLUMNIST: Good morning -- Dagen. Good to with you. I think, you know -- go ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, no. I just -- you weigh in on what you make of this hack.</p><p>LOUDON: I was -- you know, my son reacted to this. He's only 10 years old. He said, \"Wow, Mama, how in the world is President Trump going to clean up all the messes that President Obama left behind?\" This is something that should have been addressed, these kinds of hacks going back over the last eight years.</p><p>But since Obama sat on his hand and did essentially nothing, instead of, you know, focusing on the things that this President is so good at focusing on like tax cuts and reductions in government and all the great things that Americans need him doing, he's having to backtrack to take care of things.</p><p>ISIS should not be hacking us. We should be hacking ISIS. That's where we should be with our cyber security. So I'm really glad that President did do the executive order -- I think it was just last week. And is addressing this and sharing this information between the states and the government agencies. It should be a great first step to fixing some of this.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I think it's of particular interest to me that they've chosen John Kasich's site as one that they're going to be focused on especially with Kasich being such a vocal critic of Donald Trump and such a vocal critic of the health care bill, of everything that's happening right now. And they are putting that on his site among others. Why do you they that they are choosing him?</p><p>LOUDON: Yes. That's an interesting question. It honestly --- I think that it could be that they just really aren't aware of our inner workings of politics that maybe that you and I are aware of because we pay attention to it everyday.</p><p>But I also think that it could have been an attempt for more division among the leading party in the United States. I think that, you know, the more they can sow that sort of division amongst leadership that actually is in power right now, they might see that as some sort of advantage.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, actor John Depp, the latest celebrity to threaten the President. He was talking to a crowd in England at Glastonbury. Depp suggested assassinating President Trump. This comes after Robert De Niro said that he'd like to punch the President in the face, Madonna said she thought about blowing up White House, again the Kathy Griffin, the beheading that she somehow made herself the victim in all of that. The President's son -- the President's son Eric Trump responding to the threats from Tinseltown. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ERIC TRUMP, SON OF DONALD TRUMP: There are no quarters for this people. You see Johnny Depp and what he said, you know, I'd like to go assassinate, you know, the President. Johnny Depp has his own problems. He has his own problems. Like how about you go back to making movies and doing your own thing?</p><p>I mean this is a man who gave up his life to try and help this country. And he's doing a great, great job and I honestly I couldn't be more proud of him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gina -- do you believe that these celebrities are actually inciting violence. They clearly are doing it -- these are celebrities whose stars are fading or no longer exist and they are purely doing it for attention. But do you think that they are actually inciting violence as well?</p><p>LOUDON: Absolutely. And Dagen -- you make such an incredibly important point. The minute that somebody in Hollywood needs more attention or more money, they decide to say something like this and there really is no reprisal for this.</p><p>Whatever happened to Madonna? Absolutely nothing. But you know what it does? I mean could you feel more compassion for this son of the President? I was surprised he held himself together making that statement -- Eric Trump. And I tell you, the more I see of this first family, the more I feel just honored that they're sitting there in the White House, that they are willing to expose their family to this.</p><p>They didn't need this just like Eric Trump pointed out and yet they have really given up their time and their security, their own personal security and that of their own children and grandchildren just to serve our country. And I think that is one of the reasons that America wanted to see this president in place and I thought that Eric Trump's words couldn't have been nor poignant and more heartfelt.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You know, they run their mouths but all that money that they throw at these Democratic candidates -- look at Jon Ossoff -- that got him well, not elected. That got him nowhere.</p><p>Nine -- what was it nine to one California donations to -- in the state of Georgia -- donations in that election they lost to Karen Handel.</p><p>I do want to move onto health care. Because speaking of word -- former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted this on the GOP's bill. This was late Friday, quote, \"Forget death panel. If Republicans pass this bill, they're the death party.\"</p><p>What do you make of that?</p><p>LOUDON: You just really want to put Hillary down for a long winter's nap or something. I don't know. She really needs to stop injecting herself because I really think that she looks like she's making a desperate gasp every single time she opens her mouth. And it's been that way since the whole campaign and that's how she lost. And that's why she was such a horrible candidate.</p><p>And that's why the Democrats are at all-time lows in their fundraising. And that's why Republicans are at all-time highs in there fundraising. And that's why the Democrats continue to lose that they are zero for four in these special elections -- or zero for five, however you like to look at it.</p><p>And as long as Hillary continues to be so dramatic -- sky is falling all of the time, right -- the more the Democrats are going to continue to lose because they have no leadership, they have no vision and they have no ideals other than to try to bring our president down. The American people don't want that.</p><p>CARTER: I mean this isn't just, I mean, ridiculous language. This is dangerous language. I mean to reshape the Republican Party as the death party in the wake of the shooting where we have Scalise still in the hospital.</p><p>LOUDON: Right.</p><p>CARTER: We're talking about saying, this isn't -- this is so far beyond just trying to reframe a party or trying to use language in a clever way to try and, you know, shift perceptions. This is actually going to the heart of the issue that we have right now which is that people -- you're not just against something. If you're on the other side, you're evil.</p><p>You're not just -- you know, not providing care, you are going kill people. This is unbelievably irresponsible from leadership. She's taking the anti- message that she had in the campaign to a whole new level here. And I think that at a certain point the American people have to say, enough is enough. We can disagree respectfully but to go this far, I think, it's too far.</p><p>LOUDON: Yes.</p><p>CARTER: And she's got to take accountability for this. What do you think is going to be the way that we can go forward without this kind of -- really inflammatory language where you're on such diametrically opposed sides?</p><p>LOUDON: You're so right about this. This is the dehumanization that the left is using. This is precisely what led to the shooting at the congressional baseball game. And they need to be held accountable for it. I believe the American people are watching this very closely. And I believe that until they sort of take responsibility for this death, violent environment that they've created, the American people will continue to hold them accountable because they see it clearly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: She's a former politician who is gasping for relevance but also inciting violence in the same stroke by using that kind of language.</p><p>But Gina -- you hear it from all of the Democratic leadership about how Republicans don't care about people's health, that they want to hurt people, they want people to -- you hear even language about people dying from cancer. And this is going to be more of the same if this -- if this healthcare bill comes -- if the Republicans in the Senate can pass it that they've got -- they've got to counter this message because it's not going to end.</p><p>LOUDON: That's right because what the Republicans -- the message that Republicans need to seek with the American people is that real compassion comes in giving people bootstraps, right, and telling people you can pull yourself out of where you are. And that you can save your money in health savings accounts, for example, and be responsible for your own health care.</p><p>The government doesn't need to be your daddy because that's what we spent the last eight years learning to reject. And that is what the American people went to the ballot box to reject over and over again. And I believe that ultimately the American people do -- we love personal responsibility, right. We love, you know, owning our own lives.</p><p>And that is what is quintessentially American and I think ultimately that's what we will come out with, with our health care. I think that we will never settle for socialized medicine that the left has tried to impose on. And I think that's why they're continually losing.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But we are in a situation now, Gina, where you are giving the government and bureaucrats and lawmakers more power over your health care. And until people wake up and realize that, that again, it could come too late.</p><p>Dr. Gina Loudon, it's good to see you.</p><p>LOUDON: Good to see you -- Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care -- Gina.</p><p>Coming up <person><nameText>Martin Shkreli </nameText></person>heads to trial for fraud. The charges against the former pharma executive once dubbed the most hated man in America.</p><p>And today marks 20 years since Harry Potter first cast his spell on children around the world and adults. How fans can join the anniversary celebration for the first book in the hit series?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two U.S. Marines seriously burned in an explosion in San Diego. Cheryl Casone has the details. Good morning -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Good morning -- Dagen.</p><p>Yes, that's right, these marines were injured while doing maintenance on a fighter jet at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. This happened just last night. The base says that they were rushed to the UC San Diego Regional Burn Center. A spokesman says the service members belonged to a reserve squadron that is based out of Fort Worth, Texas actually.</p><p>Well, an SUV crashing into a motel swimming pool. This happened in Los Angeles. That pool was filled with kids. Police say eight people were injured when a driver of a vehicle lost control in front of the motel, crashed through a brick wall, landed right into the pool. This happened last night.</p><p>Sources are saying the children in the pool were not seriously hurt but were taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated just to be safe. And cops say the driver appeared to be in his 20s. They're investigating whether he was under the influence of drugs or possibly alcohol.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>Martin Shkreli </nameText></person>goes on trial today in a Brooklyn federal courtroom for allegedly defrauding investors. But the former pharmaceutical CEO doesn't seem to be worried about it. In fact he tells the Associated press he's excited and he can't wait. Prosecutors say Shkreli lost millions of dollars through bad trades and his side business that was a hedge fund, that he eluded (ph) a second pharmaceutical company for $11 million to pay that hedge fund -- those investors back.</p><p>His defense team says he never intended to scam anybody and that everybody was paid back. Prosecutors differ on that one.</p><p>Well, it has 20 years since J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter was first introduced to readers around the world. The eight Potter novels have sold more than 450 million copies over years.</p><p>And to mark the 20th anniversary, Kevin Kelly, Facebook has a new feature for you. I know you love this. When you type the name of any of the four Hogwarts houses into a poster comment it appears in that house's color and then an animated wand appears when you click on the names which cast a big spell.</p><p>I just kind of think you might be into it. I don't -- I'm guessing actually. You like a Potter --</p><p>KELLY: Yes. I actually used to go to the drive-in movie theaters back in Arizona. So they were great films.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Really? Yes.</p><p>KELLY: Yes. Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, I mean I'm not disputing that they're great films but --</p><p>KELLY: Yes, yes. The drive-in movie theater -- I know it was right there on the reservation. And it was perfect. It was packed. I can't tell you how many -- it was always, always packed for Harry Potter films. You had families, people bring out couches, watch it. It was a great time. Everyone was sharing popcorn.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is it wrong that I rooted for Voldemort?</p><p>KELLY: No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It just seemed right at the time.</p><p>Still ahead, <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>in the hot seat -- the former Attorney General facing new questions over her role in the Hillary Clinton e-mail server scandal. What to expect from the Senate investigation?</p><p>And Amazon's vision for the future generating a lot of buzz. The wild new beehive for delivery drones that might be coming to a neighborhood near you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Amazon moving forward with its drone delivery plans. New images from a patent application show how the company would tailor its fulfillment centers. They show a beehive shaped tower and the application for the patent says that this would help the company make deliveries in urban areas.</p><p>Joining us now is Mashable tech editor Pete Pachal. This may not be what the final version looks like but it does give you insight into <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos</nameText></person>' brain, I guess.</p><p>PETE PACHAL, TECH EDITOR, MASHABLE: Yes. He's definitely thinking long term on this. Yes. You can just imagine in the future every city has an Amazon drone beehive at the outskirts that, you know, that's just constantly buzzing.</p><p>But it's interesting. If you compare this idea with the very first unveiling of Prime Air which is what they're apparently going to call this drone service -- that was like a drone at the end of like a conveyor belt. And it was basically the drone tacked on to this already human warehouse.</p><p>So basically what this does is kind of flip the script on that. It's like ok, let's think drone first. You know -- and the humans are extra. You know, like the drone is the driving force within this warehouse. What would that look like? And they came up with this which is -- ok, it's looks a little like something from out of the matrix but, you know, I can definitely see the line of thinking there.</p><p>KELLY: But can rules and regulations get to there because the drone market is very heavily regulated and the FAA is going to have something to do with it? Is this even feasible or conceptual to put in reality?</p><p>PACHAL: I think it's feasible but absolutely, you're 100 percent correct that the regulatory and safety issues have yet to be fully resolved.</p><p>Amazon is obviously thinking a lot about that as are others like Google. And what ultimately needs to happen on these drones is there needs to be like multiple redundant systems so that if one fails, another one that's completely independent can take over. I mean really that's the only way you could safely have these aircraft in the air all over the place with a human below even if it is a sparsely populated region.</p><p>So they're thinking about this. So this is definitely longer term. I mean again, the first days of this is going to be drones tacked on to those Amazon warehouses and eventually it will get this maybe, I don't know, decades in the future.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Bezos empire is growing rapidly, of course, especially in the wake of the Whole Foods acquisition. This is the kind of move that I was standing in a Starbucks and when it was first announced, I was flying back -- I think I was at the Milwaukee airport and the people at Starbucks are like hey, oh, my gosh, check your phone, Bezos is buying Whole Foods. So it was that kind of reaction.</p><p>PACHAL: Get your latte quick because, it could be Starbucks next. Yes, it was huge. I mean, you know, not many people and companies can really upend whole industries, you know, with a quick action like that. I think I read somewhere there was something like 50 million or -- sorry, 50 billion, 60 billion market cap difference when you take into account how much his competitors fell and how much Whole Foods went up.</p><p>KELLY: But Amazon is focused on groceries?</p><p>PACHAL: Yes, very much so. And this dovetailed nicely with the systems they were unveiling a few months ago, Amazon Go which is that grocery store of the future where there are no lines and there's intelligent systems throughout the store to know what you're taking off the shelf and know what's in your bag. And you basically just walk out because it just tallies up you're -- what you've taken and bills your Amazon prime account.</p><p>BELL: So what's next, the Bezos empire, like you said it's a huge one, they're in the grocery, they've got their hand in a little of everything -- where does he go next? What's the next -- what does he have his eye on?</p><p>PACHAL: Well, it's hard to predict.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You're kidding.</p><p>PACHAL: The thing is, he's learned some lessons about not getting into places he should not. Whenever people talking about <person><nameText>Jeff Bezos </nameText></person>and like how he's brilliant and how he can move whole industries -- I always say remember the fire phone where he came out and decided, ok, I'm going to do this phone because I need to compete with Amazon and Google.</p><p>He felt pressured and if you read the reports on how that was conceived, he very much was very hands on and micromanaged the design of that. It was a complete flop. It did not work.</p><p>So he is not infallible. And he can do things wrong. So I think he's learned from that. You can see his acquisitions and his actions since like the Whole Foods -- what makes a ton sense for his empire, but you know, you've got to have to caution that --</p><p>KELLY: But he pivoted and moved it fast -- the fire phone flopped but guess what he came out with? The echo and now everyone is following Amazon's lead in that regard.</p><p>PACHAL: Exactly. And he does have an ecosystem. And I love also how he's leveraging Amazon to sell the Echo. I mean there's all these other companies like Apple's Siri and Google Home -- they are coming out with these speakers. But -- we are all trained to go to Amazon.com to buy pretty much everything we want. And he has that portal to sort of put the echo and those products in front of everyone. Hey, you want this, you want this. You're buying some back scratchers. Hey, you want this Echo, too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I'm old enough to remember when he was working at a hedge fund here in New York City before he even founded Amazon.</p><p>PACHAL: I met him at a dinner like about 15 years ago when Amazon was just expanding into consumer electronics, selling on line. And kind of -- he's changed a lot, I would say, he was much more outgoing and gregarious at that dinner and I see him speak publicly now and he's obviously a changed man and he's really --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Not giving you any ideas.</p><p>PACHAL: Yes -- very guarded now. But I mean he's also -- I still see that sort of genius and that excitement in sort of his ventures. You looked at Blue Origin which could, in the long term be his most lucrative venture in shipping things to space. There's a lot (inaudible).</p><p>MCDOWELL: Pete Pachal -- good to see you. Thank you so much. We covered a lot of ground.</p><p>PACHAL: My pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care.</p><p>Coming up: the investigation into <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>-- senators launch a probe into the former Attorney General's role in the Clinton e-mail scandal.

I'm Dagen McDowell in for <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo. </nameText></person>It's Monday, June 26th. Your top stories at 7:30am Eastern Time.</p><p>It's Energy Week at the White House, President Trump set to host the Prime Minister of India in Washington this afternoon. And the week will highlight our country's energy dominance including a multibillion dollar natural gas deal with India.</p><p>Former Attorney General <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>under fire, the Senate Judiciary Committee looking into her involvement in the probe surrounding Hillary Clinton's email while she served as Secretary of State. Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales weighing on the probe with our own <person><nameText>Maria Bartiromo </nameText></person>on Sunday Morning Futures.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALBERTO GONZALES, FORMER ATTORNEY GENERAL: I think that they're all legit in the questions raised by some of these allegations and I think that it's perfectly appropriate for the congress. The Judiciary Committee to examine exactly what happened here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: The details on that investigation ahead. SpaceX pushing the final frontier, the company launching and landing not one but two rockets over the weekend, what the move means for the space race coming up.</p><p>And Facebook taking on Tinseltown, the details as the social network hits the walk of fame in search of scripted content, it's going to cost them.</p><p>Futures showing the market gains across the board in Europe as well. Stocks are heading higher as we wrap up the month of June. In Asia overnight, markets finishing the day with green across the screen.</p><p>Plus, chipping in for the win, the highlights as Golfer Jordan Spieth wins the Travelers Championship out of the bunker and into the hole, there you go.</p><p>We're moving on to this story because we want to get Judge Napolitano right now. The Senate Judiciary Committee looking for answers from <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>on whether or not she intervened in the Clinton email server investigation. One of the question in the letter to <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>reading, \"During your time in the Justice Department, did you ever have communications with Former DNC chairwoman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, her staff, her associates, or any other current or former DNC officials about the Clinton email investigation?\"</p><p>Let's bring in Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano. Judge, can they force <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>to testify?</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Yes. Of course they can force <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>to testify.</p><p>I agree essentially with what Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told Maria yesterday in the clip that you just ran but I would actually extend it one step farther, there is enough evidence here just on the basis of the little snippets given to the Senate Intelligence Committee by Former FBI Jim Comey that Mrs. Lynch was either conflicted or working at odds with the Justice Department and in behalf of Mrs. Clinton's campaign and the DNC when she told them to use different terminology for the investigation.</p><p>Now the terminology really doesn't matter, the FBI was investigating Mrs. Clinton anyway, but the terminology, let's call it a matter not an investigation. This result to some FBI agents teasing the director saying, \"Oh, you're not the director of the Federal Bureau of Matters rather than Federal Bureau of Investigations.\" But the terminology maybe indicative of a mindset on the part of Attorney General Lynch that she was going to do whatever she could to prevent Mrs. Clinton from getting indicted and the Senate Judiciary Committee is entitled to inquire into that.</p><p>So is the Justice Department. This is not under Bob Mueller, this does not involve with the Russians. The DOJ itself, Jeff Sessions can assign a team of investigators, FBI agents, and prosecutors to investigate his predecessor as to whether or not she obstructed justice or behave in a way that constitutes misconduct in office by preventing or doing everything she could to slow down or impede the investigation of Mrs. Clinton.</p><p>KELLY: Judge, wasn't it not only just what happened with Comey's testimony but there's also assertions that she actually did tell other democratic operatives from -- that she would prevent this matter from going too far.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That's the reason for the question that Senator Grassley's people wrote to Attorney General Lynch about her communications with Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a congresswoman from Florida and at the time the Chair of the Democratic National Committee.</p><p>It is alleged, this document has not seen the light of day if it exists that there is one or several emails between Debbie Wasserman Schultz and <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>concerning the behavior that <person><nameText>Loretta Lynch </nameText></person>will take to further the DNC interest while Mrs. Lynch was the Attorney General. That if it happened would be misconduct in office.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What's the punishment then?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well it's a felony depending upon exactly what charge -- what they charged her with, it could be five or ten years. In jail it's very serious, it's the equivalent of obstruction of justice, same allegations they're making about the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Incredible. Let's move on to Supreme Court Justice, Anthony Kennedy is said to be -- there have been some reports out that he is considering retirement but Kennedy has given no indication if that is true or not.</p><p>The 80-year-old court veteran has long been viewed as the critical swing vote among his peers, often casting the breaking vote on contentious cases. White House Advisor, Kellyanne Conway refusing to divulge if Kennedy had reached out President Trump about his future, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: I will never reveal a conversation between a sitting justice and the president or the White House but we're paying very close attention to these last bit of decisions and I can tell you one thing, just as the president did with Justice Neil Gorsuch, whenever there are vacancies, whenever that happens, he will look for somebody who has fidelity to the constitution, he doesn't make up the laws, they go along. And somebody who has a judicial temperament and a record that's beyond repose as to Justice Gorsuch.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Look, there's a couple of moving parts here, Justice Kennedy did tell friends years ago during the either first or second Obama Administration, I don't remember which that as soon as there was a republican in the White House he would seriously think about leaving.</p><p>He's been in the court for 33, 34 years and he's 80-year-old. Justice Kennedy, this is intriguing, scheduled a weekend sort of get to together with all of his former clerks, one of whom is Justice Gorsuch for the fall of 2018, they moved that to this past weekend. Hint, maybe he won't be on the bench in the fall of 2018 on the other hand, he has four incoming clerks whom he's hired who are coming in in the fall of 2017. So we're getting mixed signals. He will either make an announcement from the bench this morning at 10:00am Eastern Time when the court convenes or he will decide, \"You know what, Neil Gorsuch is my former clerk, he's a brilliant wonderful justice, I want to enjoy a year or two working with him on the court before I go.\" It got to be one or the other.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Could we also get some sign from the court this morning of what they might do, some kind of guidance on the president's executive order?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think we're going to get more than a sign we're going to get an announcement. They're either -- they are scheduled to release announcements on applications for this isn't a case before them because it's not over with it, it's an application for emergency relief.</p><p>They are scheduled to issue orders at 9:30 this morning about how they're disposing of them. If they simply say denied, that means that the stays, stopping the president's travel ban, stay in place until these cases are tried. If they do anything other than denied, they will have to have some specificity in there. The question is, should the travel ban stay in place while it is tried in a federal court in Hawaii and a federal in Minneapolis or should it not stay in place? Well, it's being tried.</p><p>KELLY: Well the answer is --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It still hasn't been tried.</p><p>KELLY: The answer is yes, right? I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well is there any way to know what they're going to say?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: No. There's no way to know, it's going to come out in two hours. We'll find out then.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, it's very exciting.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes. Yes, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Big day.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: We have producers in the courtroom, we'll know immediately. It's going to come out and we have red flags and white flags so we'll know because they take your Blackberries and your Iphones when you're in there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I remember the red flags during the Martha Stewart verdict.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Actually, it wasn't flags, it was scarves.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, yes. I'm kidding about the scarves, I don't know the means of communication but Fox people will know first.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So 9:30 for that and then maybe 10:00 we'll hear from --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, 10:00 we're waiting on a very interesting opinion about whether or not when the state gives money to schools to repave playgrounds they can give it to catholic schools as well.</p><p>KELLY: This is the Missouri case?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think it was -- yes, this is the Missouri case, yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Look at the showoff over there.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Why is -- he's always there, he's a smart kid.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I make -- my goal is to make you laugh and I think -- incredibly insight from Judge Andrew Napolitano as always, such a pleasure Judge. Thank you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You're welcome.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, a new milestone in the final frontier, SpaceX blasting off twice in one weekend. What the incredible fee means for the future of private space travel in a private space company.</p><p>And Facebook hoping users will like what they see, how much the company is reportedly planning to spend to bring their own TV shows to the social media network.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rescuer searching for survivors from a tourist boat that capsized on a reservoir in Columbia. Cheryl Casone has the details on that, Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. So Dagen, at least nine people have died in this accident, 28 still missing. Recreational boats and jet skis rushed out to the scene, they were pulling people from the boat as it went down.</p><p>But they avoided even a deadlier tragedy by getting there as fast as they could, this all went down yesterday. Right now it's unclear of what caused the boat to sink but survivors say that it appeared to be overloaded and that nobody onboard was even wearing a life jacket.</p><p>Well SpaceX is going back-to-back, Elon Musk company pulling off two commercial satellite launches from opposite coast within 48 hours. Both launches went off about a hitch provided the strongest sign yet that SpaceX is on track to ramp up their launch tempo.</p><p>And TV shows may soon be coming to Facebook. The Wall Street Journal reports that the social network is looking to Hollywood to help produce original content for its platform and this could start as early as this summer. The push for TV shows is the company's efforts target the tens of billions of ad dollars that's spent on TV. Facebook is telling Hollywood producers they will share viewership data with them, the only difference on this Dagen, of course, some of these would have advertisements on them included. You go to Netflix, they don't have that. But on the Facebook issue you would.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you so much Cheryl. Coming up -- Lindsey was caught on camera there real quick. You were just reading. You were just reading, again, doing research.</p><p>BELL: Sorry.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's okay. Would you -- quickly, would you watch original content on Facebook?</p><p>KELLY: Depends on what it is. Probably not just given their bend but they have to do this because a lot of the videos are being repurposed and advertisers are getting mad at them because it's not original and it's really repurposed and taken from other sites. So this is a response to that so this is a response to that. But content is key, it's going to be expensive for them.</p><p>CARTER: I think it's expensive.</p><p>BELL: It could be a big game changer for them, I really think.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. But it also would drive up the cost of the content for potentially Netflix and Amazon and Hulu and HBO. The more players you have with big wallets, the more that content is going to cost.</p><p>KELLY: Well they need the content to be good though, that's the issue. So if they could -- if Facebook's willing to pay for it and it's really good content then yes. But if they're -- if it's not, we'll have to see.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I watch the Dodo, you know what I'm talking about? It's all the --</p><p>KELLY: The Dodo?</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Dodo, it is animal videos. That's all it is, it's like short animal videos and it's awesome.</p><p>CARTER: I'm all about the animal video.</p><p>KELLY: So where is that? What platform?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's on -- you know what, pick your platform baby.</p><p>KELLY: Oh, love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Instagram but it's largely Facebook delivered platform.</p><p>KELLY: Wow.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Dodo, that's my suggestion this morning. From bunker to birdie, Jordan Spieth's epic shot at the Travelers Championship that earned the young golf star a place in the history books.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The biggest celebration in golf used to be the Tiger Woods fist pump now it's the Jordan Spieth chest bump. Jared Max is here with that story. Good morning Jared.</p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Dagen, this is not our grandfather's PGA Tour. Yesterday in Cromwell, Connecticut 23-year-old Jordan Spieth gave us a highlight and celebration we're sure to see for years to come.</p><p>The final round of the Travelers Championship, Jordan Spieth goes to a playoff against Daniel Berger. Watch this, first playoff hole, from the bunker 60 feet away, the sand goes flying and the ball goes flying right into the hole, a beautiful shot, watch this. Listen to how it sounded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And right down that (inaudible) he's done it again just as he did it with John Deere for his first win.\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MAX: And just like at John Deere number one, this is victory number ten. A birdie for Spieth, wire-to-wire win at the Travelers. At the 10th carrier win, he's now over $32 million in carrier earnings. Yesterday, a $1.22 million purse for Spieth.</p><p>And hey, speaking of a purse, check out what the St. Louis Cardinal fan found in her bag last night at the Cards Pirates Game. Bottom of the seventh in, Yadier Molina has a foul ball into the stands, where did the ball go? You've heard of the basket catch? Well this was a purse snatching grab by a fan. \"Honey, I have a little stuck in my mouth, any change you have a toothpick or a flossy in your -- no, but I have a baseball.\" Cards beat the Pirates 8-4, what a grab.</p><p>Congratulations also to Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback Tim Tebow. Promoted by the New York Mets Organization from low single A ball by the Columbus Fireflies to high single A ball with the St. LouisMets in Florida. Tebow batting only two 22 with three homers, 69 strikeouts or for 212 a bats, general manager of the Mets Sandy Alderson said the bottom line is the average isn't there but he's improving.</p><p>Well Sunday marked the annual old timers day at Yankees Stadium in the Bronx, New York. It was Brooklyn where the inaugural game for the old timers three-on-three basketball league got underway. And nearly 16,000 fans showed up to Barclay Center, there were four games between NBA all timers. Now this league created by a rapper/actor Ice Tea, a lot of celebrities on-hand yesterday. Now Allen Iverson for one of the teams, the hall of famers a coach, a player, and a captain but he only played nine minutes yesterday.</p><p>The games are funky, if the first team to 60 points and you have to win by two in the first two games went beyond -- went the distance and then kind of into overtime. They also have a four point shot. And I think this is great. I mean you could get almost 16,000 people to watch three-on-three basket and this is going to become to Olympics eventually too. Not with the old timers but wouldn't you like to see the old timers?</p><p>KELLY: Which Olympics? The 20 --</p><p>MAX: 2020 I think this one is going to be there.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you watch the NASCAR race? It's one of the -- it's the only race a road course -- two road courses every year and this was the first one of the season at Sonoma.</p><p>MAX: Yes. Kevin Harvick.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Kevin Harvick.</p><p>MAX: Who he wins for the first time in like 21 races yesterday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Like first win this season, he races for Stewart-Haas, racing his first win in a Ford. See, Stewart-Haas made this major move from Chevrolet to Ford at the start of the season.</p><p>MAX: And it was one, two, three, Ford. Ford was win (inaudible)</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this is a very big deal for both Ford Motor Racing and for Stewart-Haas and for Kevin Harvick because, again, a win guarantees you a place in the playoff which starts up later this year.</p><p>And then there was, of course, Danica Patrick wrecked into her boyfriend, Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. she still finished I think P17 but --</p><p>MAX: Kyle Busch's crew.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I kind of enjoy that.</p><p>MAX: What's with Kyle Busch's crew? Is he getting in trouble again for, what, loose lug nuts? Already in trouble. Yes, I mean, right?</p><p>KELLY: Yes. It was --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why are you giggling? Loose lug nuts are very serious problem.</p><p>CARTER: It's sounds like it's code.</p><p>MAX: Well he had two improperly attached lug nuts because it's from silver room where the guy is like, \"Yes, it was the lug nut.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL: He had a bad race several weeks ago and he acted like basically his child, he acted like a baby in the kind of after race press conference. So it comes down for poor behavior.</p><p>MAX: We're going to see that Jordan Spieth highlight in years to come. We know that Tiger Woods did this, we're going to see that chest bump for some time.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the crowd went wild.</p><p>CARTER: I love the excitement.</p><p>MAX: And the crowd went wild. \"Go to the hole. Go to the hole.\"</p><p>BELL: (inaudible) really?</p><p>MAX: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is golf. Golfers have -- you have to kind of keep quiet but --</p><p>MAX: Imagine Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player colliding with their caddies?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Did you just say Jack Nicholson?</p><p>MAX: No, Jack Nicklaus.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You said Nicholson.</p><p>MAX: You can't handle the truth.</p><p>KELLY: He came to (inaudible)</p><p>MAX: Here's Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well maybe I just heard Nicholson. We should do -- hey, let's go to the videotape.</p><p>MAX: Let's go to the video and see one hole.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you Jared. Good to see you. Jared Max. Catch Jared's sports reports Fox News Headlines 24/7 or SiriusXM 115.</p><p>Still ahead, don't use soda to make your skin pop, why doctors are warning against the new trend using Coca-Cola to tan faster.

Even in the digital age, this would be quite convenient. The only catch? In exchange for free mail, postmasters would be permitted to open your mail and read our letters and bills. The benefit, postmasters would insist, is they would know when you're planning a family vacation. And then the post office could send you hotel recommendations or advice for the best restaurants and activities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Convenient, right? </p><p>  On second thought, you might rather pay the 55 cents for postage if it meant keeping advertisers from knowing the location and itinerary of your family vacation before you even get on the plane.</p><p>  We prefer that strangers not read our mail -- that's why we've made doing so a federal crime punishable by up to five years in prison. We have blinds because we don't want outsiders peering into our homes. We have laws to protect our health care records because we definitely don't need strangers knowing our medical history.</p><p>  So why should we treat our online identities -- and privacy -- any differently?</p><p>  The answer to this question -- posed by my friend Tom Siebel, a tech entrepreneur -- clearly is that we should not. But if we are to secure our data in an increasingly digital world, should we expect government to singularly and effectively do the job for us? I would argue, no.</p><p>  Some politicians, primarily those running for president, have called for brute government intervention, including breaking up big companies like Google or Facebook. This clarion call has the benefit of simplicity, but has failed to explain how it will increase security for our data. What does forcing Facebook to sell WhatsApp have to do with Facebook or WhatsApp collecting, exploiting and selling our data?</p><p>  Others are calling for invasive congressional regulation. But as history tells us, overly broad and indiscriminate regulation often insulates the incumbents and boxes out the upstarts and smaller firms -- a consequence we've experienced with the Dodd-Frank financial regulations law. Even Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, acknowledged this possible outcome to Congress a year ago.</p><p>  Unsurprisingly, these remedies lean on the premise that only government can solve market inefficiencies that lead to irresponsible corporate behavior.</p><p>  I don't think we should feel confident that the bureaucratic leviathan has what it takes to develop or enforce nimble responses to rapid change in the technology industry.</p><p>  We should look instead to the greatest driver of competition, the free market, for the most compelling responses to our privacy concerns.</p><p>  Technological advancements can meet Americans' demands for privacy, and perhaps already are, through cryptonetworks. Cryptonetworks are decentralized platforms governed by the community of users rather than by chief executives or small management teams.</p><p>  You would access these networks by logging on to a browser similar to what you use today. But the piping undergirding the decentralized networks is powered by blockchain technology capable of delivering stronger data security, portability and privacy for every user.</p><p>  When you purchase or post something on a blockchain platform, the network will verify your identity using an encrypted key that is permanently and exclusively yours. Each action is recorded on a distributed ledger. This will make fraud nearly impossible.</p><p>  Under the current internet framework, users' data is usually controlled by the platform -- online consumers leave a trail of data bread crumbs, making us vulnerable to privacy invasions. In a decentralized network, however, our data would be controlled by this blockchain encryption. Users would grant and revoke access to data, no longer entrusting third parties or tech companies with that responsibility.</p><p>  Furthermore, this technology would increase competition, because blockchain makes it easier for anyone to create an alternative platform for communicating or providing some service. With the open-source nature of blockchain technology, a community of users is free to take what they like from an existing platform to a new one if they feel their privacy has been infringed or trust violated. Accountability is built into the system.</p><p>  Each new platform is a fresh opportunity for users and creators to interact, shop and communicate without Big Brother or Big Tech tracking every move.</p><p>  [If you're online -- and you are -- chances are someone is using your information.

The Federal Trade Commission should step in when companies break the law or violate settlements with consumers or the government. Indeed, the F.T.C'.s role is perhaps more important and challenging than ever, because big tech continues to grow bigger.</p><p>Congress also has a role. It should develop a clear privacy framework that sets one federal standard for the country and adheres to three simple principles: You should be able to see, control and delete your data. These standards have the advantage of being bipartisan, which in today's Washington is saying something.</p><p>  While the obscurity of blockchain might make it seem intimidating, we are seeing leading technology companies and venture capitalists looking to bring it into the mainstream.</p><p>  As the most technologically advanced country in the world, it is America's responsibility to give this technology space to run and grow. Companies that have repeatedly broken promises to their users deserve scrutiny. But the federal government must not mistakenly turn scrutiny into suppression.</p><p>  In the right ''light touch'' regulatory environment, decentralized networks can provide the transparent, secure platforms that respect an individual's privacy and dignity.</p><p>  Kevin McCarthy, a Republican of California, is the House minority leader.</p><p>  Like other media companies, The Times collects data on its visitors when they read stories like this one.

We're going to  find out why and what it means for the Obama administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And President-elect Obama rolling out a new stimulus package; he plans to  discuss it with lawmakers today.  We're going to have all the details.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session today  exploring Bernie Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme and how the SEC  missed it.  We're going to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p> And it may be too early for a hamburger, but we'll take a look at the  rivalry between burger giants, Burger King and McDonald's.</p><p> Today is Monday, January 5th, 2009.  \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right  now.</p><p> Good morning.  And welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  Happy New Year  everyone, I'm Alexis Glick.  Back in the seat and ready to go.</p><p> Well, we're going to get the latest on Governor Bill Richardson's stepping  away from his job as Secretary of Commerce in just a moment.</p><p> And the Madoff hearings begin today.  The House Financial Services  Committee will probe how it is that the SEC missed the scheme.  We're going  to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p> And what will 2009 look like for trading?  We get hopefully off to a good  start; at least so far.  We'll continue to see whether or not that will  work through.</p><p> And why would anyone want to start a new football league in this economy?   We're going to find out.</p><p> But first take a quick look at the U.S. futures this morning as right now  we're down 16 points; 8,942.  The S&amp;P right now down 1.60.  The NASDAQ down  2.75, but we had climbed above that 9,000 mark just late last week which we  hadn't been to since early November, we'll see whether or not it shapes up  to be a good year.</p><p> Well, let's get things started this morning with the three things you  should know.</p><p> President-elect Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats meeting today are  looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both  individuals and businesses.  This is an attempt to gain Republican support  for his more than $700 billion economic stimulus package.</p><p> And French President, Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with  Israeli and Palestinian authority leaders.  Now, the president is there in  an attempt to push for a cease-fire in of course, the war-torn Gaza area.</p><p> On the ground this morning Israel struck at new Hamas targets in Gaza as it  tries to rein in rocket attacks by the terrorist group.</p><p> And Microsoft's dominance on the Internet, well it may be waning.  The  software giant saw the share of its Internet browser Explorer drop from 74  down to 68 percent last month.  Making the biggest inroads -- Mozilla  Firefox which landed 21 percent of the market share.</p><p> All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p> Now, for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets,  we go to Ashley Webster in London.  Good morning Ashley and happy New Year.</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR:  And happy New Year to you too  Alexis, and welcome back.  Good morning everybody.</p><p> We're off to a positive start and certainly in Asia overnight and so far in  Europe we are also moving higher although not exactly setting the world on  fire, but we are higher, and that's good.</p><p> London Exchange, the FTSE 100 up about a quarter of a percent, just a  little more than eight percent.  On the CAC-40 in Paris also higher by  about a tenth of a percent.  And on the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up about a  third of a percent.</p><p> Another iconic company falling victim to the credit crunch we find out this  morning Waterford Wedgewood, now this is a company announcing today that  it's calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The Irish group  best known for Wedgewood Pottery, Royal Dalton and Waterford Crystal  collapsed after talks over possible investment in this business failed.  It  has officially called in the administrators.</p><p>Meantime European automakers say they are taking aim at Detroit they've  said this before and failed.  Will it work this time?  Well, Volkswagen and  BMW of Germany are gearing up to expand market share in the U.S. in the  next few years.  VW, investing in, in its first U.S. factory in two decades  and expects to triple U.S. sales to one million vehicles by 2018; BMW  meanwhile, introducing a new small car and expanding its distribution  network.  We'll see how this works out.</p><p> Now, let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the  morning.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Hey, good morning, Ashley and thanks a lot.</p><p> We are keeping an eye on these U.S. automakers today; certainly the big  three from Detroit releasing their sales figures for December and the rest  of 2008 later on today.  And the numbers are expected to be pretty dismal  with American carmakers selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08; if that's  the case it would be the biggest drop since 1974.</p><p> When it comes to our foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW are actually  speeding towards an expansion in their stateside market according to a  report in \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.  So that's an interesting  kind of twist in things.</p><p> And this week also kicks off two pretty big tech shows.  Apple is set to  unveil some new products today and tomorrow when Mac World kicks off in San  Francisco.  Investors will be looking into new gadgets as well as any kind  of insight at all into the health of the CEO, Steve Jobs, who has just  become an issue of late.  Jobs not expected to attend the MAC World this  year.</p><p> And on Wednesday night it should be pointed out the Consumer Electronic  Show begins out of Las Vegas.  I'll be there to cover the latest new  products later on in the week from CES.</p><p> Now, Pfizer is another one we're watching today, it's weighing a merger  deal with a rival drug company or it would weigh one.  The Financial Times  reporting the CEO Jeff Kindler says the world's largest pharmaceutical  company is quote, \"open to opportunities and constantly looking at those  which are big, small and in between.\"  Pfizer's stock price, well, we have  it is up behind you there 18.27 a share at the close; it's down almost 20  percent over that one year time span.</p><p> And those are your three market movers of the morning.  Alexis, back over  to you Alexis.</p><p> GLICK:  All right Connell, thank you so much.</p><p> Well, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson will not be joining the Obama  administration as Commerce Secretary.  Richardson pulled out yesterday  citing an ongoing federal investigation into a state contract awarded to  one of his political donors.</p><p> With more on this story we're joined by Michael Coleman the Washington,  D.C. Bureau Chief for the \"Albuquerque Journal\" which has been covering the  investigation for some time and Joe Monahan a New Mexico political veteran,  who now writes a blog about state politics.</p><p> Michael let me start with you.  Your newspaper reported on the  investigation back in August.  Apparently it has been on the docket now for  many months.</p><p> What type of relationship is it that Governor Bill Richardson has with this  financial company known as CDR Financial?</p><p> MICHAEL COLEMAN, ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL D.C. BUREAU CHIEF:  Well, their owner  David Rubin had contributed about $100,000 to a couple of Governor  Richardson's political action committees.  And right around the same time  that these donations were made the New Mexico Finance Authority, which is a  quasi governmental agency with board members appointed by Governor  Richardson, awarded this company a couple of contracts to help with some  really complicated financial transactions, bond sales, bond swaps, et  cetera.</p><p> One of those contracts was a no bid contract.  And another one of those  contracts CDR had issued -- had submitted the RFP but they weren't the top  bidder, they weren't the top scored bidder on that but they still got the  job.</p><p> GLICK:  So in other words, as I understand it, they were the second in line  of the bidders for the contracts so their suggestion here is this a pay for  play scandal.  On the other hand, Governor Bill Richardson's team says, we  did absolutely everything right.  In fact, the contract that we did with  CDR Financial worked out to have some really important profitability for  the state of New Mexico.</p><p> Tell me about that.</p><p> COLEMAN:  Right.  Now, they are very adamant about the fact that CDR saved  the state a significant amount of money.  And these bond swaps, these  complicated transactions that CDR specializes in was not part of the  original request for proposal.</p><p> But apparently New Mexico Finance Authority gave them points for that  nevertheless.  And it turns out they did one of those swaps.  The only bond  swap in New Mexico history apparently.  And Governor Richardson and his  team do say that that saved the state a lot of money.</p><p> GLICK:  Joe, walk me through the normal type situation here because as I  understand it, that there is a process for bidding out contracts like this,  but this one appears as though it was done sort of quietly.</p><p> Tell me why that adds even more speculation to the story.</p><p> JOE MONAHAN, NEW MEXICO POLITICAL BLOGGER (ON THE PHONE):  Well, there's  really no reason that we know why that the paperwork is not on file with  the state for this contract.  I know Michael's newspaper has reported on  that.  And that's one of the aspects of the investigation, just how this  deal was transpired.</p><p> The governor has run into problems down here before with contracts and  campaign contributions.  He's had to return campaign contributions several  times after the press has reported that the campaign contributor was given  a state contract.</p><p> So this pay-to-play situation has haunted Richardson somewhat, but not to  the scale that it has now because it obviously is a national story.</p><p> GLICK:  You know, Michael the $64,000 question that everybody is waking up  with this morning is they are wondering how it is if you have been  investigating this in your newspaper now, dating back to August, how it is  that the Obama administration didn't know that this could be an issue in  terms of his ability to take over this cabinet seat.</p><p> I mean what's the back end story here?</p><p> COLEMAN:  Yes, that is the $64,000 question today.  I think as you said, we  had reported this back in August.  I talked to members of the Senate  Commerce Committee in December and did a story.  And they said they were  aware of this.</p><p> You know, my hunch is that maybe they weren't aware of the extent to which  the FBI was looking into this.  I'm not sure exactly how the conversations  went between Governor Richardson's and Obama's transition team.  There was  some indications yesterday and some reports that maybe Governor Richardson  wasn't as forthcoming as they would have liked.</p><p> Richardson spokesperson denied that to us yesterday and said he was were  very forthcoming.  So maybe some of this will play out in the next 24 to 48  hours.  We'll see.</p><p> GLICK:  Joe, how does this play in New Mexico, I understand he has some of  the greatest ratings -- favorability ratings as a governor there.  And  could, if this investigation is put behind him, could he actually wind up  in another cabinet seat at one point?</p><p> MONAHAN:  Well, I think this has really hurt Richardson with Obama.  He's  not going to be hurt much in New Mexico.  He is a well liked governor.  He  was re-elected with a record amount of vote.  But Richardson has taken a  major hit nationally on this.  The cabinet positions are going to be  filled.</p><p> Also Ken Salazar is now the Department Interior Secretary designate; that  is an important Hispanic appointment that Obama has made so it puts less  heat on the administration when it comes to the ethnic aspect of this.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, well, Michael and Joe, we'll leave it at that.  Of  course, we'll continue to follow this story.  Thank you gentlemen, very  much.</p><p> COLEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p> GLICK:  Well, the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session  this afternoon.  They're exploring Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion  Ponzi scheme.</p><p> The Securities and Exchange Commission's Inspector General could get a cool  reception after \"Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC  examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years.</p><p> Here for a preview of the House session, we're joined by Scott Garrett,  he's the Republican Representative of New Jersey who is a member of the  House Financial Services Committee and Harvey Pitt, former SEC Chairman and  Kalorama Partners CEO.</p><p> Gentlemen, good to see you.</p><p> Harvey, let me start with you.  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting as we just  talked about the number of investigations over the past eight years; pretty  staggering statistics.  What does this say about their failure to do the  job?</p><p> HARVEY PITT, FORMER SEC CHAIRMAN:  Well, I think it reflects something  we've all thought might have occurred here, and that is the potential for  human failure.</p><p> There appears to have been a fair amount of warning to the SEC, and it  appears that when people looked into these issues, they came away without  concluding that anything wrong was going on.</p><p> I do think it's important to remember that this was a deliberate fraud, and  that Madoff was keeping a couple of sets of books.</p><p> GLICK:  So all right let me come back to that in just a second, Harvey.</p><p> Congressman Garrett, let me go to you, because I understand one of your  colleagues is running this, Congressman Kanjorski.  And the real story here  is he wants to figure out how did this situation occur in the first place?   Was this a lack of proper oversight, and what kind of regulatory reform  might it lead to?</p><p> Do you worry that it's going to lead to even more regulatory oversight than  we already have?</p><p> REP. SCOTT GARRETT, (R) NEW JERSEY:  Oh, we always have to worry about that  whenever the government is involved, there's always -- what is the term --  a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis.  A crisis as it were; obviously this is a  problem whether you are a large investor or middle-sized investor, a  private investor or small investor; a lot of people were significantly hurt  in this situation.</p><p> Now, to his credit, the Congressman Kanjorski made the comment I think  earlier this morning that there obviously is responsibility also on the  part of the investor in this situation.</p><p> That each investor has to make, you know, their own due diligence, if you  will, when they make their investments.  So you have to look at both sides  of the equation.</p><p> But back to your initial question, we have to be concerned whether  government comes back with a knee-jerk reaction with saying we're going to  give more authority, more power, more money into the very same agency that  was responsible and failed on the job.</p><p> GLICK:  So Congressman, as I understand it, the SEC's Chief, you know,  chief risk officer, their inspector is going to appear today in front of  Congress.</p><p> GARRETT:  Yes.</p><p> GLICK:  The number one whistle-blower though in this was originally  scheduled to appear and is now not appearing.  What do you hope to get out  of it, and why the change in the lineup?</p><p> GARRETT:  I can't give you an answer on the change in the lineup.   Obviously there are questions that we would like to have put there, say,  what did you know before and why hasn't the information come forth through  all the investigations that the SEC has made?</p><p> The other aspect of this as well as far as the outcome of the equation,  we'll have all these investigations.  We'll get all the information we  possibly can, but at the bottom line, where the government is not like the  private sector.  The private sector is such that if this occurred in the  private sector, where business failed to do what they were responsible for  doing, whether it's manufacturing something, or making something or turning  a profit, that business at the end of the day would be out of business.</p><p> But when government is involved, the normal reaction to it is to do just  the opposite.  Throw more money, put more regulation on in place, and we  saw that with the Enron situation and Sarbanes-Oxley.  We came back with so  much more regulation in place, that it actually was a detriment to business  going forward -- </p><p> GLICK:  Right.</p><p> GARRETT:  -- as opposed to a benefit to them.</p><p> GLICK:  Harvey, let me go back to you because one of the things you touched  on as you answered my first question is the fact of the matter is we now  understand there have been offshore accounts.  There may be many offshore  accounts.</p><p> What would the SEC know or not know in that situation?  I mean, you know,  look, people are going to think this is egregious in how the SEC missed  this but are you telling me that because there might have been offshore  accounts, there could have been loopholes or opportunities for the SEC to  miss it?</p><p> PITT:  Well, the SEC has had a lot of experience in dealing with offshore  accounts.  Obviously there's bank secrecy and problems with getting all  that information, but the critical function here was to go in and examine  Madoff's operations, his books and records.</p><p> And I believe picking up on something the Congressman said, that it's  physically impossible for any agency of government to do what we are  expecting them to do.  That doesn't excuse this particular situation.</p><p> But there are 11,000 registered investment advisors, and the SEC has 3,700  people on its staff.  There's no way the SEC can continuously review these  people.  And so what's required is a whole new paradigm for dealing with  inspection and examinations, and it has to be done quickly.</p><p> GLICK:  You know, I don't know if you got a chance, Harvey, to see an  article in the New York Times, the Sunday New York Times yesterday, an  opinion article written about what needs to change at the SEC.  But one of  the key things that is talked about in this article is whether or not  there's just too close a relationship between Wall Street and the role of  the top risk officer, top inspectors at the SEC who exchange jobs between  becoming a chief risk officer at the Wall Street firm and the SEC.</p><p> How do we make sure that we learn some valuable lessons here and that we  don't allow something like this which involved this many investigations to  go unnoticed?</p><p> PITT:  Well, I think what you have to do is change the entire structure of  examinations.  That's what's the problem.  You can't take some kids right  out of college who are being paid $50,000 or $60,000 a year and ask them to  examine $50 billion hedge funds.</p><p> What you need to do is have a completely different system, one that we  proposed back in 2003 but which hasn't yet been adopted, and I think would  solve a lot of this problem.</p><p> The SEC has to do a much better job of setting the standards and requiring  independent examinations with reports both to the firm reviewed and the  SEC, and then the SEC's personnel can go in and look at the issues that  have been uncovered.</p><p> I think otherwise we're going to be just setting the SEC up for failure -- </p><p> GLICK:  Right.</p><p> PITT:  -- on a continuing basis.</p><p> GLICK:  All right gentlemen, we're going to leave it there.  I know this is  going to a hot topic, Congressman Garrett, Harvey Pitt, as always great  pleasure seeing the two of you.</p><p> All right guys, coming up we're going to go live to the Gaza Strip with the  latest on Israel's ground assault and escalating tensions in the Gaza area.</p><p> And this latest Mideast conflict has oil experts worried.  We're going to  tell you why in just a couple moments.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Welcome back.</p><p> Well the fighting in Gaza continues.  Israeli troops on the ground pushing  deeper into the region.  Dominic Waghorn of Sky News is live at the Gaza- Israeli border with the very latest.  Dominic, good morning.  Bring us to  up-to-date on the very latest.</p><p> DOMIC WAGHORN, SKY NEWS:  well, the fighting is continuing in Gaza.  The  ground force operation continues on three fronts.  The Israelis have been  fighting with Hamas in the south.  They are targeting the smuggling tunnels  there that Hamas have used to smuggle in weapons from Egypt.  They have  been hit with aerial bombardments and the Israeli forces are now on the  ground fighting Hamas there.  An armored column, a big armored column of  somewhere between 100 and 150 tanks -- and armored personnel carriers has  pushed right the way through the sea and is occupying land that effectively  splits Gaza in two.</p><p> That means Gaza city which you will be able to see behind me if it wasn't  for the haze is now encircled by Israeli forces.  The fiercest fighting  though, I think, has been in the area behind me.  That's the north most bit  of Gaza around the refugee camp of Jibalia (ph) and the town of Bethleher  (ph).  The reports are very close to fighting, house to house combat.   According to one reports, hand-to-hand fighting in tunnels underneath those  houses where an Israeli soldier was nearly abducted but was able to escape.   There's no letup in the pace of this action.</p><p> GLICK:  Dominic, talk to me about the humanitarian costs of all of this.  I  know the French president Nicolas Sarkozy is supposed to travel there  today.  What are the implications here?</p><p> WAGHORN:  yeah, the Americans have stood full square behind the Israelis on  this not critical of it but the British governments and the French have  been critical of this ground invasion.  And the main reason for that and  the mounting concern is this humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian  death toll.</p><p> Around 500, over 500 people have been killed by this in Gaza.  And we don't  know how many of them are civilians, but we think at least a quarter of  them, many of them women and children.  There were reports today of three  children being killed in a house, for instance, near that armored column  with one tank shell.  Another artillery shell wiped out a family of seven  to the north of Gaza city.</p><p> The death toll yesterday was 40 and halfway through the day we're heading  towards that number again today.  The Israelis though say they have no  alternative but to carry out this operation.  What they are not saying is  how much longer it will go on for.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Well, Dominic, we will leave it there.  Thank you very  much for bringing us up-to-date on the very latest.  Of course be safe.   Now let's send it over to Charles.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p> Well as the ten day assault escalates the price of oil continues to tick  upwards; right now crude trading around $46.  It had approached $47 earlier  as some Islamic countries say that oil should be used as a weapon.</p><p> With a closer look at how the conflict is affecting oil, I'm joined by Phil  Flynn, Fox Business contributor, vice president and senior market analyst  for financial firm Alaron Trading.</p><p> Phil, the first question, Israeli troops are now on the ground in Gaza.   Can we expect this to continue to move the price of crude oil higher?</p><p> PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING:  Not necessarily to be honest with you.  I  think this is an emotional reaction to the market.  I don't think anybody  really believes that OPEC or other oil-producing countries are going to use  oil as a weapon in this situation.  But there is no doubt that  psychologically on light volume it did drive this market higher.  I don't  think it's sustainable.</p><p> PAYNE:  Having said that, do you think that -- looks like earlier today we  saw $47, it is pulling back a little bit, is there a ceiling right now that  oil can go to?  I mean it's made a huge move off of $33.</p><p> FLYNN:  It really has.  We're talking in three days on light volume.  And  really what started this move was the news out of Russia and the Ukraine.   So this is really I don't think geopolitical driven at all.  I think it's  more optimism about the new year.</p><p> Really what drove the market was this incredible start to the year that we  had with the stock market turning around, so I think we're seeing a mood  change in the market somewhat.  For oil to technically confirm that this is  a reversal will have to close above $50 a barrel, but I think that's going  to be a tough job today unless the stock market performs magnificently.</p><p> PAYNE:  Phil, we have talked about these geopolitical events.</p><p> Let's talk about the stimulus package here.  What impact is the Obama  stimulus plan having on oil and what will it do for oil as the year goes  on?</p><p> FLYNN:  I think in the short-term it's creating little bit of optimism, and  if you get optimism, that can turn the market around a little bit.  And  it's amazing how quickly it's changed.  I mean, if you look back at just,  you know, New Year's Eve, oil prices were at $33.  It was doom and gloom.   All of a sudden, boom, we're starting to feel optimistic again and that, in  and of itself, can turn oil around.</p><p> PAYNE:  All right.  Well thanks a lot Phil.  Really appreciate your time  this morning.</p><p> FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p> PAYNE:  Coming up, we're about almost two hours away from the first full  trading week of the new year getting underway.  We will see if the Dow's  rally on Friday can continue; 258 points, that was a big one.  Looking for  an encore.</p><p> More \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" when we return.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER:  Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Ashley Webster in  London keeping an eye on overseas trading on this the first full week of  trading in 2009.</p><p> So far so good; we've seen generally a positive day of trading in Asia  overnight.  And so far in Europe we're in the green, although not with a  lot of conviction, it has to be said.  We're up about 7 points on the FTSE  100.  Essentially flat now in Paris on the cac-40.  Up about a quarter  percent in Germany on the Dax 30.</p><p> News today of another iconic business that's fallen victim to the credit  crunch.  Waterford Wedgewood announced today that it is calling in the  administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The group best known for  Wedgewood pottery and Royal Dalton of Waterford Crystal collapsing after  talks over a possible investment in the business failed.  This Irish  business dates back to 1759 -- a sad day.</p><p> Meantime, in the oil business, Saudi Arabia may well be laying the  groundwork for a sizable reduction in crude oil shipments.  Many members of  OPEC just seem reluctant to commit to the group's pledge to cut output.  So  Saudi Arabia likely to take the lead in acting to shore up sagging oil  prices.</p><p> Crude prices by the way are higher today.  That is giving a boost to the  oil stocks, but even here we're being a little mixed.  BP up one and a half  percent in London, but Royal Dutch shell down two percent.</p><p> We've also seen money coming out of gold, down 17 percent in London -- $17  that is per ounce in London trading.</p><p> Mining stocks doing okay but turning rather mixed as well.  Rio Tinto up  one and a third percent.  Xstrata, another big mining company up three and  a half percent.  But you know what, the U.S. dollar, stronger this morning;  up against both the euro and the British pound that means the pound now at  $1.45.</p><p> That's the very latest from European trading.  Now let's go back to New  York for the latest headlines with Jenna Lee -- Jenna.</p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you very much, Ashley.  Good morning  once again everyone.</p><p> It could be a showdown on Capitol Hill.  Roland Burris is headed to  Washington today and plans to be sworn in as the junior senator from  Illinois along with the rest of the new senators which happens tomorrow.   But Democratic leaders have said they won't allow Burris on the senate  floor.</p><p> He was appointed of course by tainted Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich who  is accused of trying to sell the seat; the seat that he is supposed to take  over to the highest bidder.  Burris says his appointment is perfectly legal  and denying him entry to the senate would be denying the people of Illinois  their rightful representation.</p><p> We will have much more on Burris's controversial appointment on the next  hour of \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" by the way.</p><p> Continuing with policies now, Democratic Al Franken is also hoping to be  sworn in as a new senator tomorrow.  Minnesota state canvassing board is  expected to declare Franken the winner of one of the closest, most hotly  contested and longest senate races ever.</p><p> Franken has beaten incumbent Republican Norm Coleman by 225 points.  That's  out of nearly 3 million votes cast.  But Coleman has a number of possible  legal challenges left, including contesting the entire recount.  Because of  that, it's unlikely that Franken, of course the former \"Saturday Night  Live\" star, will be sworn in with the rest of the new senators tomorrow,  but we shall see.</p><p> Some people are trying to cash in on the Bernie Madoff scandal, EBay is  full of items featuring the Madoff's securities logo.  There's this fleece  jacket which the seller says is a piece of history; top bid right now, $510  for that.  Check out this hat from the Madoff securities golf tournament  from 2003, right now it's going for $217.50.</p><p> A steal, a bargain?  I'm not sure.</p><p> You are up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network.  For more news  throughout the day, check out foxbusiness.com.  And coming up, we're going  to take a look ahead to what we might see during the first full week of  trading in 2009.  You never know.  And Fox Business welcomes Charter  Communications and Cox Communications in Hartford Connecticut.  Hartford is  the insurance capital of the world.  We welcome you Hartford.</p><p> We're going to take a look at how the economy is impacting the insurance  industry when \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" returns.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ALEXIS GLICK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  </p><p> In this half hour we're going to take a look at how the insurance industry  is faring in this economy.  We're going to take a look at a new football  league -- I know it's hard to believe -- and how they plan to compete with  the NFL.  And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill today.  Much more on what  could happen in that hearing later at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  </p><p> Well, the first full week of trading in the new year gets under way in less  than 90 minutes.  And investors are hoping Friday's 250-point gain is just  the beginning.  </p><p> Let's see how things are shaping up this morning.  Take a look at the  futures.  As you can see right now, the Dow is down 6 points.  The S&amp;P is  pretty much unchanged.  NASDAQ right now is up just a couple points.  It's  actually two hours before things get started.  </p><p> I said 90 minutes, but you know I'm getting excited.  </p><p> So what will 2009 mean to Wall Street?  </p><p> Richard Suttmeier is the founder of the stock valuation Web site  ValueEngine.com and Charles Payne, WStreet.com founder and FOX Business  contributor.  </p><p> Good morning, gentlemen.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GLICK:  Happy new year.  It's good to see you, guys.  We're back with  another year.  </p><p> All right.  So Charles, there is so much to talk about.  It's hard to know  where to begin.  But I guess the most important thing for people at home  right now is, is this a good place to dip your toe in the water?  </p><p> I mean do we start 2009 thinking I want to be an investor?  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, you know what?  I think --  I start 2009 thinking I want to be a trader.  You know, whether or not you  dip your toe in for the long -- listen, here are two thing.  If you're  really the type of person that's going to consistently put money into the  market, fine, don't stop doing that because you'll eventually -- you will  be buying at the bottom.  </p><p> If you're that person who's been sitting on about 40 grand, waiting for the  right moment, if you're willing to be nimble, then this is the time.  If  this -- if you think this is the time to buy and hold, you may have a  better opportunity down the road.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, nimble.  Now my man Richard over here is hyperventilating.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I know.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  He's like -- he's (INAUDIBLE) what's good about this.  So, Richard,  you're my technician and -- you do a lot of work on this.  And you're not  very bullish.  Tell me why.  </p><p> RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Well, over the near  term it's -- the market is fine.  It's in good shape.  And we started out  with a 3-percent gain for the Dow on Friday.  So that's kind of like our  handicap for the week, if you will.  </p><p> I think, I think the Dow is trying to get up to the Election Day high,  which was 9654, something like that.  That's when President Obama or soon- to-be President Obama got elected.  And so that was the good news.  </p><p> Then we had the cascading of bad news that took us down to 7450.  So that's  kind of a trading range.  And we're trying to get back to that Obama high  by inauguration.  </p><p> GLICK:  But you think we will retest those lows?  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  I think, in the second half of the year, we'll go to lower lows  because the second half recovery of 2009 will be as strong as the second  half recovery we had in 2008 which everybody was talking about a year ago.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, and didn't really happen.  </p><p> You know, Charles, a lot is resting on this stimulus package, you know, to  the tune of 800 billion, President-elect Obama is meeting with officials  today on the Hill about it.  Now we're hearing about $300 billion in  proposed tax cuts.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> GLICK:  I mean, he's starting to really appeal to those blue dog Democrats  and making sure that he's putting things in this package that are going to  make Republicans and the blue dog Democrats happy.  </p><p> How important is this package?  </p><p> PAYNE:  I think it's very important.  You know, I'm working on a -- on a  report right now for our subscribers, and I'm comparing his first 100 days  in his -- in his presidency to three presidents, FDR, Eisenhower, Ronald  Reagan, because those are three guys who came in with very serious, ugly  economic situations and had to make bold moves.  </p><p> It's really a sort of a pleasant surprise, to be honest, that they've been  talking about tax cuts to this degree.  I would like to see him even  friendlier to business.  I'd like to see him give businesses a break.  </p><p> Multinationals, allow them and bring money that they make overseas back  into American without these onerous tax penalties, because that's one of  the things that George Bush did that actually, in my opinion, worked, the  Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  It did create jobs and it brought a lot of  money back to our shores.  </p><p> So I think Wall Street is going to be excited about that.  What's going to  be intriguing today is -- today is to see how the infrastructures react to  this news, because before it was like a trillion just to repair roads,  maybe it won't all go to that.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  Yes.  Well -- and part of the Obama camp situation is they  need to provide things that are actually going to stimulate the economy and  not long-term stimulate but short-term stimulate.  </p><p> How do you feel about these new tax cuts?  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  I think that that...</p><p> GLICK:  They're not new actually.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Well...</p><p> GLICK:  Some of them will be.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  I know, but I mean, come Friday and we see a loss of 500,000  jobs and a 7 percent unemployment rate and the fact that the economy in  2008 lost 2 million jobs, that's going to be hard to stomach in this  environment.  </p><p> And we need help from the housing market.  Mortgages need to be redone.   And we have not addressed that.  That's what I've been saying for a year.  </p><p> GLICK:  This is your -- this is your mortgage mulligan that you...</p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Absolutely, 100 percent.  </p><p> GLICK:  So just before we go here, you tell me, the -- what is the  quickest, easiest way to solve the housing problem.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Give everybody a mortgage mulligan, a do-over, and I mean the  billions of dollars and trillions of dollars that we spent in 2008, if we  had had done this a year ago, realizing that there was a problem in the  housing market and people needed help making their monthly payments, we  wouldn't be in the predicament we are today.  </p><p> GLICK:  Who pays for the mortgage mulligan?  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Who's paying for all the other stuff?  </p><p> GLICK:  Uncle Sam.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Exactly.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Uncle Sam.  I mean it -- it's not easy to determine who's to  bailout -- who to bail out.  But any problem is solved from the source.   What started all of this?  Bad mortgages that shouldn't be given to people.   House prices that way -- that were way too high.  </p><p> No one's addressed yet the fact that we still have $617 billion in  construction and development loans.  That's another 3 million homes that  are on the books of the bank in terms of loans to builders and developers.  </p><p> GLICK:  That could fail, yes.  </p><p> All right, guys, we're going to -- we have to leave it there.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Right.  </p><p> GLICK:  Richard, I know you're excited about this and -- give me that TARP  list.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  I just want you to know that Richard does more homework than  anybody I know.  He sends us the best research.  He has a five-page list  here in the TARP program of what we, the American taxpayer, own.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Look at how little the lines are for -- these are all the companies  that we own as taxpayers.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Over 200 banks; right?  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  282 banks now.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p> GLICK:  But who's counting?  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  And seven of them are private banks.  How -- I couldn't even  buy one of these if I wanted to.  </p><p> GLICK:  282 and counting.  All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.  </p><p> Well, we want to welcome our newest viewers on Cox and Charter  Communications in Hartford, Connecticut.  That city is known as the  insurance capital of America.  Home to insurance giants the big ones, Aetna  and the Hartford.  </p><p> You know the insurance industry pumps about $12 billion into Connecticut's  economy and competes with other states such as Iowa for insurance payrolls  and tax revenues.  </p><p> With more on the state of the insurance industry and Hartford, I'm joined  by Thomas Sullivan.  He is Connecticut insurance commissioner, and Bob  Hartwig is president and economist for Insurance Information Institute.  </p><p> Good morning, gentlemen, thanks for being here.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning.  </p><p> GLICK:  Tom, let me start with you.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning.  </p><p> GLICK:  You know we're in the midst of a very serious economic downturn.  A  lot of talk about the insurance industry in the wake of what happened to  AIG last year.  </p><p> What is this face of it?  How -- how is it shaping up to look in 2009?  </p><p> THOMAS SULLIVAN, CONNECTICUT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER:  Well, the insurance  sector has felt some of the pinch of the general economy, quite frankly,  the insurance sector has been a little bit more depressed than general S&amp;P  and some of the broader indexes.  </p><p> But, overall, the -- industry is in good shape.  We haven't had any major  insolvencies.  We haven't had really any insolvencies.  And when you point  out AIG, I would point out to you that AIG, its frailty has occurred in its  holding company which is not regulated by state regulators like myself.  </p><p> GLICK:  You know, Bob, when we talk about insurance, we can go in so many  different directions, obviously.  There's life, there's property, there's  casualty, but one thing the insurance industry normally does very well is  it prepares for risks or shocks to the system.  </p><p> Has it been better prepared than perhaps the rest of the financial arena,  particularly what we saw in 2008?  </p><p> BOB HARTWIG, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE:  Well, absolutely.  Every day  the insurance industry has to assume that the worse case scenario could  happen, whether it's something like a 9/11, or a Hurricane Katrina, or a  stock market wash out.  </p><p> Sometimes all these happen -- happen at the same time.  So we're prepared  for that.  So just take a look at the numbers.  In 2008, 25 banks failed.   Not a single insurance company failed as a result of the financial crisis,  and so I think that's a very important distinction.  </p><p> So at the end of this, I think that we'll see the insurers emerge with  their risk management model which is one where we always retain some of the  risk, we don't pack it off, sell it off to the securities markets and  forget about it.  We retain the risk, we have skin in the game every inch  along the way.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK, and Bob, we should also differentiate, too, between life  insurance and property and casualty, because I imagine that life insurance  in a recessionary like environment like this would feel some heat because  in essence it is one long-term source of an investment vehicle.  </p><p> HARTWIG:  Well, that's right.  Some insurers can invest -- life insurers  can invest for a longer term so they may be sensitive to fluctuations in  different types of asset prices.  That has happened but nevertheless they  do build up very strong capital positions, designed to be resilient in  market downturns.  </p><p> The industry is very, very heavily regulated.  It's also one that's fairly  transparent.  Have there been some short sellers having their way for times  -- for periods of time in the market?  That has happened.  But the reality  is insurers are writing new policies paying claims just as they did before  the crisis hit.  </p><p> GLICK:  And, Tom, let me go back to the state of Connecticut.  We talked  about two of the largest insurers in the world, Aetna and Hartford, but  you're also seeing competition with places like Iowa trying to get big  insurers in there.  </p><p> What are you doing on a state basis right now to make sure that this  remains the capital of the insurance industry?  </p><p> HARTWIG:  Well, our -- hallmark has been insurance in terms of our economy  and the state of Connecticut, Governor Rell and her administration have  focused a lot of attention on the industry.  </p><p> We've set up through the metro Hartford alliance effectively our chamber of  commerce here in Hartford, an insurance and financial services cluster so  that we can continue to leverage the talent that Connecticut has to be able  to deliver to the insurance industry.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Well, Tom and Bob, we're going to leave it there.   Thank you, gentlemen, very much.  </p><p> HARTWIG:  Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Coming up, in today's economy, why would anyone want to  start a new football league?  Well, the Arena Football League folded its  operations but now a new league plans to compete with the NFL.  We're going  to talk to United Football League commissioner coming up next.  </p><p> And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill this morning.  We're going to find out  what changes might be in store for the SEC when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.  Stay with us.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Well, this past weekend the road to the Super Bowl kicked off with  the NFL playoff.  I was glued to the television as usual.  </p><p> Well, although the economy is down, sports economists expect the NFL to see  an increase in the league's 2007 revenues which exceeded $7 billion.  Those  numbers have a couple of former finance executives thinking that there may  be room for more pro football so they formed the United Football League.  </p><p> It has six cities ready to go and is talking about giving fans an IPO  investment in those franchises.  </p><p> Here with the details on their deal I'm joined by UFL founder Bill  Hambrecht.  He's the CEO of the financial services firm WR Hambrecht and  Company.  And Michael Huyghue.  He's the commissioner of the UFL and a  former NFL executive.  </p><p> Michael, let me start with you.  There are a lot of people out there who  say how could you consider doing something like this in this economy,  particularly given what we have seen with the football, the Arena League  which just folded?  </p><p> Tell me a little bit about it and why you think you can do it.  </p><p> MICHAEL HUYGHUE, UNIFIED FOOTBALL LEAGUE COMMISSIONER:  Well, I'm a  passionate football fan.  And  I think there's millions of passionate  football fans.  You just mentioned, you're watching the NFL games.  </p><p>Our league is really a great opportunity for the spillover of talented  football players to get an opportunity to play.  </p><p> Kurt Warner is a classic example of a player who was sort of missed in the  original selection of players in the NFL and he's had a prosperous career.   There's hundreds of those type of players.  And we just want to provide  those opportunities as well as for coaches and front office executives.  </p><p> GLICK:  You know, Bill, you were known for what you have done in the  investment and the Wall Street community, and here it is,. you're starting  a football league.  It doesn't necessarily go together.  </p><p> Tell me why you wanted to do this.  </p><p> BILL HAMBRECHT, UFL FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN:  Well, I thought there was a great  attraction to having a football franchise owned by the public and by the  fans and by the people who live in, in the city where the franchise is  located.  </p><p> So to me the -- my world of finance and IPOs and the football world came  together.  </p><p> GLICK:  So Bill, so tell me how that works?  Because you're talking about a  stake, many people will liken to what happens with the Green Bay Packers,  for example, but tell me how will this situation work.  </p><p> I understand it'll be in as many as sixteen and  cities to start.  </p><p> HAMBRECHT:  That's correct.  There will be six cities, six independent  franchises, and each franchise will be financed by local people, both  private investors and public investors.  </p><p> GLICK:  So Michael you have, as we mentioned in the very beginning, you're  a former NFL executive.  You know what works in the football world, in the  football community, and this is a different idea at a time when most people  would say how could you possibly get the funding?  </p><p> How do you get the participation?  How do you get the players and the --  money to pay them the necessary salaries?  Walk me through.  </p><p> HUYGHUE:  Sure.  </p><p> COLLINS:  How are you putting this all together.  </p><p> HUYGHUE:  Well, you know, it's an interesting time.  </p><p> Clearly the economy is a tough time, but there are a number of people that  are looking for opportunity.  And our league is one of innovation.  We are  finding people that are excited about football in their markets that don't  have NFL franchises to support.  </p><p> They believe in the concept that there's a lot off talented football  players out there.  And so they're putting groups together.  Each franchise  is run by a chairman and he has five or six or seven local independent  investors with them.  </p><p> An d they're funding about $60 million to operate this franchises.  We have  about a $20 million player salary cap and we're going to get some exciting  players.  You know, I ran, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for the first seven  years and I saw the same type of players I think we'll get in our league.  </p><p> GLICK:  And Michael, I have heard rumblings that you would even consider,  perhaps if you could, trying to attract somebody like Michael Vick now that  that Ryan is over at the falcons at the falcons and doing fairly well, one  could argue -- doing well until this weekend.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.  </p><p> GLICK:  But -- is that true?  </p><p> HUYGHUE:  Well, it's going to be a league of opportunity.  And we're  certainly going to let the fans have a say in almost everything we do.  In  fact, we're putting up on our Web site Vick or no Vick?  And he'll be one  example of many players that will consider, of course, players like that  have some interesting backgrounds, considerations that we'll have to  consider.  </p><p> But there's going to be a league of opportunity, and certainly he'll be one  example of many players we will consider.  Players like that have  interesting background considerations that we will have to consider.  It is  going to be a league of opportunity.  Certainly he will be one  consideration.  </p><p> GLICK:  Bill, you know, I guess the number one thing you guys have to  figure out is how you are going to differentiate yourself given  particularly what has happened with the Arena Football League.  </p><p> You tell me, how are you going to do that?  </p><p> HAMBRECHT:  Well, I think the big differentiation is that we're going into  markets that the NFL is not established in or is leaving.  So -- you know,  basically the NFL has done a lot of things really well.  They, they have a  great product.  They have a great sport.  And they have, you know, just  done a wonderful job of implementing.  </p><p> But they have not expanded into some of the major growth areas of the  United States.  I mean, it is amazing when you think about it that Los  Angeles does not have its own franchise.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p> HAMBRECHT:  Nor Las Vegas.  </p><p> GLICK:  So true.  You know, Michael, before I let you go, I understand some  big announcements will come during Super Bowl week, and that is it by as  early as March 1, we will know the teams, and you'll start, you know,  having people try out?  </p><p> HUYGHUE:  Yes, exactly right.  We will have an announcement around Super  Bowl week announcing the six owners and general managers and presidents.   We already have a $20 million training facility in Casa Grande, Arizona  that the city is building for as far as teams to compete in.  </p><p> So we've got a lot of things.  We start signing players March 1st.  So  we're really excited about the events coming up.  </p><p> GLICK:  I'm excited.  More football is a good thing.  </p><p> Michael Huyghue, great to see you, and Bill Hambrecht, as well.  </p><p> Good luck guys and keep us up-to-date and come back during Super Bowl week  to give us the first dibs on those cities.  We'll analyze right here.  </p><p> All right, gentlemen, thanks.  </p><p> Let's get the very latest headlines with Jenna Lee.  Good morning, Jenna.  </p><p> JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  ... taking a look at politics first.  </p><p> President elect Barack Obama is working on a tax cut plan which could be  worth as much as $300 dollars.  </p><p> Mr. Obama and leading Democrats are hoping the tax cuts will entice  Republican support.  Mr. Obama was hoping to get the bill written and ready  for him to sign the day he takes office.  But many say mid to early  February is more likely timeline.  </p><p> The tax cuts, by the way, are part of an economic stimulus plan worth as  much as $775 billion dollars over the next two years.  At least that's  reportedly how much it is worth.  </p><p> And last night Mr. Obama officially landed in Washington, D.C.  His wife  and daughters made the trip on Saturday.  He said he's looking forward to  being in Washington, but not exactly looking forward to living in a hotel  for two weeks.  </p><p> His daughters start a new school this morning.  That's why they decided to  go to Washington two weeks before the inauguration.  </p><p> Well, imagine the situation.  You've got an interview for the job you want,  but if you take the interview, you are going to get fired from the job you  have.  </p><p>Boston college football coach, Jeff Jagodzinski, was just -- just led his  team to a bowl game, faces that very situation.  He's set to interview for  the head coaching job with the New York Jets, but the ESPN reports if he  does Boston College is actually going to fire him.  </p><p> Apparently, though, the coach reportedly plans to go ahead with the plans  and interview anyways.  </p><p> I guess no risk, no reward.  </p><p> You're up-to-date now the FOX Business Network.  Now it's time for  \"Charles's choice.\"  </p><p> GLICK:  Unbelievable.  Getting fired for having a conversation with the  JETS, unbelievable.  </p><p> All right.  In his Wall Street strategies hot line, Charles Payne says the  start to a new year of trading Friday was surreal as retailers,  homebuilders and tech stocks fared better than they should have and he says  more good news could be coming.  </p><p> \"The broad market or the board market has a nice wind in its sails and most  of the major equity indices are on the verge of big-time breakouts.\"  </p><p> Joining me now with more on this is -- in my bullish Mr. Charles Payne.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  So you're feeling good.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, and particularly from a short-term point of view.  You know,  it's interesting, Richard Suttmeier spoke earlier about his technical  parameters, same thing.  I'm looking at the Dow, there really is no  resistance between 9000 and 9600.  </p><p> S&amp;P is on the cusp of a major breakout as well.  So you're going to get a  lot of momentum players who've been sitting on the sidelines who feel like,  you know what, better hop on this train.  </p><p> GLICK:  But do you also agree with Richard that we could, at some point  this year, retest the lows?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  You know, I think what we're -- we're putting hope and  - anticipation.  A lot of this is rationalization.  </p><p> GLICK:  Around the inauguration, right?  </p><p> PAYNE:  It can't get worse than this.  There's going to be a lot of money,  and how long can we keep shrugging off bad news?  </p><p> You know we'll see Friday will be the first test.  If the numbers come in  more than 500,000 people lost their jobs and the market still goes up, then  I say ride this wave, but understand at some point these numbers do mean  something.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Negatively.  </p><p> GLICK:  At some point the shoe has to drop.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  Let's look at a couple of the names.  First one,  SalesForce.com.  </p><p> PAYNE:  SalesForce.com.  You can see where the stock is really beginning --  you know, you can see it has some resistance right there.  It's beginning  to turn around here.  This is a stock that I like a lot.  We've talked  about this before in the past.  I think they're going to be acquired.  </p><p> I will say, though, Alexis, it's an expensive stock, it's not cheap.  It's  trading at a six times book.  Nevertheless, technically, it breaks out at  35, from there it has room to 40.  And if they are acquired, it's been in  the rumor mill for about two years.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK, and remind us, what do they do?  </p><p> PAYNE:  They do software.  They compete with -- SAP and Oracle.  In fact  this guy who started this company used to work with Oracle and it just --  it's one of these things.  I don't know if I would consider it mission  critical but certainly, in this sort of economic environment, businesses  would buy software to try to make things work out for them as opposed to  spending money elsewhere.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  CNH Global.  Tell me about this company.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, you've heard of their products.  Case, New Holland, big  equipment, you know, a lot of agricultural stuff.  Also a lot of  construction stuff.  And you know, this whole stimulus thing that we're  talking about, same sort of thing.  </p><p> You can see where the stock is just building a base here.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, building the bottom there.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  So right in the air, once it breaks through that point, I  think it's off to the races.  But, not just stimulus in America, you know,  China, Europe, everywhere we're going to be seeing a demand for these sort  of products.  </p><p> The last two quarters they blew the cover off the ball but the quarters  before that they missed.  But this stock is so cheap down here.  I love the  risk-reward.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  We have to leave it here.  I know we're going to go into  another one but we've got a lot more stuff to cover.  </p><p> PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Charles, thank you very much.  Good tips.  </p><p> PAYNE:  You got it.  All right.  s</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Coming up we're going to go \"In the Pit.\"  We're going  to talk Madoff, more on the scheme and what, of course, will happen today  in D.C. when -- testimony begins at 2:00 p.m. today.  House Financial  Services Committee are going to talk about it.  </p><p> Also we want to welcome -- look at this.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Vegas.  Whoa.  </p><p> GLICK:  Cox Communications in Vegas.  We love Vegas.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Absolutely.  </p><p> GLICK:  We'd like to go visit you in Vegas.  All right, that's coming up  next.  We'll be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Congress will be searching for answers today in a $50 billion  scheme allegedly tied to Bernie Madoff.  Lawmakers are going to be grilling  the Securities and Exchange Commission over why it is that it took so long  to uncover the scandal.  </p><p> \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning saying that the SEC examined Madoff's  investment company eight times in 16 years.  Now the SEC also reportedly  followed up on e-mails from a New York hedge fund that described madoff's  business practices as highly unusual and yet nothing was done about it  which is so incredibly frustrating.  </p><p> Then, of course, we learn now that there are all these offshore accounts as  well.  What do you make of this?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, it's -- sort of the stuff that main street has always, you  know - </p><p> GLICK:  Paranoid about.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, that the fix is in, that the big guys everyone looks the other  way even that -- even when they go in there, but this -- it's a very  complicated situation.  </p><p> I think the SEC needs to train their personnel a lot better, you know, the  thing about today's hearings, though, the guy holding it, the  representative, Paul (INAUDIBLE), I'm a little worried because he's already  made certain comments, which makes me -- for instance, he's saying this  whole thing provides a glaring example of Congress must provide reforms.  </p><p> GLICK:  Do something about regulation.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  So, you know, are we going in there to try to figure out  the answers or are we going in there with preconceived, you know,  political, and you know...</p><p> GLICK:  He's been fighting for more...</p><p> PAYNE:  ... determination.  </p><p> GLICK:  He's been fighting for mire regulatory oversights since 2000 so  this is going to give a lot of people who want more of regulatory...</p><p> PAYNE:  There's no doubt about that but the question is, is that the  problem?  I mean after all the man was investigated.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p> PAYNE:  The investigations were run poorly.  But he was investigated.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> LEE:  And you have -- you had personal experience on that Charles.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> LEE:  You thought that the people that came to your shop had weren't really  equip to do it.  </p><p> PAYNE:  They had no clue.  We I say no clue, it was sad.  I men it's really  weird, you know?  You know as a registered investment adviser you get --  audited periodically.  So we're being audited.  They had two young kids  right out of college.  And they really had, what I said, Alexis, no clue.   It was sad.  </p><p> GLICK:  That is what the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said to us this  morning is you've to do something about the examiners, you know e young  kids coming out of college.  </p><p> They are not going to know how to look for loopholes in a $0 billion  investment firm.  Let's leave it there.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Let's leave it there.  Of course, we're going to  continue to talk about that.  Hearings will be at 2:00 p.m. today.  We'll  be covering that.  </p><p> And coming up next, we're going to talk about Obama's fiscal stimulus plan.   What does it look like?  That's next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of  MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis Glick.  Happy new year.  </p><p> In this hour, we're going to take a look at President-elect Obama's new  stimulus plan.  And Woolworth's will close its doors overseas.  So why does  it have a business impact here?  We're going to explain.  And the latest  installment of America's greatest business rivalries.  It's a good one.   It's about the burger wars.  It's McDonald's versus Burger King.  </p><p> But first, take a quick look at the futures here in the U.S. because this  is going to be a very busy week for economic data, in particular those  unemployment numbers due out this Friday.  Right now the Dow is down 35  points.  The S&amp;P is down 4.  Nasdaq up 3.  It's pretty much unchanged to  start the morning.</p><p> Well, let's start hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with the three  things you should know this morning.  </p><p> President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are looking to put  forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and  businesses.  This is an attempt to gain Republican support for its more  than $700 billion economic stimulus package.  We'll talk more about that in  a moment.</p><p> And French President Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with  Israeli President Shimon Perez.  The two leaders will hold a working  political meeting to discuss political and security issues in Gaza.   Sarkozy will also met with the Palestinian Authority leaders in an attempt  to push for a cease fire in the ongoing Gaza conflict.  </p><p> And the Bernard Madoff scandal goes to Washington.  The House Financial  Services Committee beginning an open session this afternoon exploring the  $50 billion Ponzi scheme.  In the hot seat will be the Securities and  Exchange Commission's inspector general after \"The Wall Street Journal\"  reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company  eight times in as many as 16 years.  </p><p> All right.  Those are the three top stories you need to know about this  morning.  Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas  market, let's go visit Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p> Good morning, Ashley.  </p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis, and good morning,  everybody.  </p><p> We've had a positive day of trading in Asia overnight on this first full  week of trading for 2009.  And here in Europe, well, we're desperately  hanging on, trying to stay positive but we're starting to sink just a  little bit.  Let's take a look at the latest numbers.  Here in London, on  the FTSE 100, we're now down about 0.2 percent.  In France, on the CAC 40,  down about 0.1.  We've been in the same range ever since the opening bell.   And the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up slightly by 0.1 percent.  So not a whole lot  of conviction right now.  </p><p> But some bad news today, or some sad news certainly.  It's been in business  since 1759 in Ireland, but no more.  Not unless a buyer can be found.   Irish company Waterford Wedgwood announcing today it is calling in  administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The Irish group best known for  Wedgwood pottery, Royal Doulton and Waterford Crystal, collapsed after  talks over a possible investment in the business failed.  </p><p> A glimmer of hope.  Take it where you can.  European investor confidence  increased for the first time in seven months in January thanks to low  interest rates and government measures to stimulate the economy.  The  latest index rising from minus 42 to minus 34.  Doesn't sound that great,  but the biggest jump in more than three years.  And we'll take it.</p><p> Now let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning.  </p><p> Good morning, Connell.  </p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Ashley.  </p><p> Keeping an eye on a number of things today, including the U.S. automakers.   The big three from Detroit set to release their sales figures for the month  of December and the rest of 2008 today.  As you might expect, those numbers  are expected to be pretty dismal.  The American car maker selling 3 million  fewer vehicles in '08.  That's the forecast.  If that's the case, the  biggest drop since 1974, while the foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW,  this morning, speeding towards an expansion.  Their stateside market,  there's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about those expansion plans  today as we look at the GM and Ford stock prices.  </p><p> Now, number two, we want to take a look here at Walgreen for a moment.  The  drugstore chain just coming out as we speak with some same-store sales  numbers for last month, the month of December.  And it looks like stores  open at least a year saw sales increased by 4.9 percent, as we look at  Walgreen's stock price there.  And that one over -- that one-year time span  you're looking at is down about 25 percent.  And it says that some calendar  shifts had a positive impact on the month.  And the pharmacy sales,  comparable sales there, were up by 8.5 percent.  And overall sales up  almost 11 percent, 10.8.  But again, sales at stores open at least a year  up almost 5 percent at Walgreen.  </p><p> And number three is Boeing, securing a contract worth $2.1 billion with  India.  The aircraft manufacturer is going to deliver at least 8 of the P- 81 anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare airplanes in the next four  years.  Boeing's looking to -- a bid for India defense projects totaling up  to$20 billion over the course of 10 years.  </p><p> And those are your three market movers of the morning, Alexis.  Back over  to you.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, Connell, thank you very much.  </p><p> Well, President-elect Obama prepared to meet with economic leaders and  economic advisors today in Washington.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that the future president is crafting a plan that could provide  over $300 billion in tax cuts.  Fox Business' senior Washington  correspondent Peter Barnes joins us with the very latest.  </p><p> Good morning, Peter.  </p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Alexis.  </p><p> The president-elect will start negotiating the details of a massive new  stimulus plan, which may total around $700 billion, $800 billion or so, to  save or create up to 3 million jobs.  And we can confirm now that the  president-elect will propose tax cuts of about $300 billion as part of that  plan.  That's from Democratic sources on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> Now let's take a look at the plan's major provisions as we know them this  morning.  There would be $150 billion in tax cuts and tax credits for  workers.  $100 billion or so in tax breaks for companies to create jobs and  to make new investments in plant and equipment.  </p><p> The plan would extend unemployment benefits, including to part-time workers  for the first time.  The plan would expand Medicaid to unemployed workers,  also for the first time.  And other provisions could include subsidies to  employers who continue health insurance coverage to laid off and retired  workers.  </p><p> All of this on the table today when the president-elect meets with top  Democrats and Republicans on The Hill.  The tax cut provisions, something  that Republicans have been looking for, to support a stimulus plan.  </p><p> The goal has been to try to get the work on the stimulus plan done and  approved by both the House and Senate by the time Mr. Obama is inaugurated  on January 20th, but congressional leaders warning this weekend that they  will need more time to consider the plan.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. STENY HOYER, (D) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: It's going to be very  difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have  sufficient time to be reviewed and then sufficient time to be debated and  passed.  But we certainly want to see this package passed through the House  of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the  Senate and have it to the president before we break for the presidential  break.  </p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": And that's mid February? </p><p> HOYER: Early February, yes.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES: And that, Steny Hoyer speaking with our own Chris Wallace on \"Fox  News Sunday\" yesterday.  </p><p> Mr. Obama has his first meeting this morning at 11:00 with House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi.</p><p> Alexis, back to you.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, Peter Barnes, thank you very much.  </p><p> Well, Mr. Obama says his proposed American recovery and reinvest plan is  crucial to not only solving the current economic problems facing America,  but challenges that may come along in the future.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT: We need an American recovery and  reinvest plan that not only creates jobs in the short term, but spurs  economic growth and competitiveness in the long term.  And this plan must  be designed in a new way.  We can't just fall into the old Washington habit  of throwing money at the problem.  We must make strategic investments that  will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLICK: Well, for more on that estimated $775 billion stimulus plan, and if  it will kick-start the economy, I'm joined by Dr. Peter Morici, an  economist with the University of Maryland, and Erin Billings, the associate  editor of the Capitol Hill newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p> Good morning, guys.  Great to see you.  </p><p> Dr. Peter Morici, good to see you.  Happy new year.  </p><p> DR. PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND ECONOMIST: Happy new year.</p><p> GLICK: So you hear this morning about $300 billion in tax cuts.  You're  probably falling over in your chair.  Wow, is he speaking of blue dog  Democrats and Republicans or what? </p><p> MORICI: He absolutely is speaking to blue dog Democrats and Republicans.   One problem I do see, though, is it's so complex.  I mean the investment  provisions are fairly arcane, which is going to lead to a lot of  negotiations.  And ultimately that's going to take time.  </p><p> One of the advantages of a tax cut is it bites faster.  But infrastructure  spending gives you more bang for the buck longer term.  If he wants  strategic investments, that's the place to find them.  The kinds of tax  cuts he's talk about pretty much are retreads of past stimulus packages.  </p><p> GLICK: Well, it's interesting, Erin, because, you know, there have been  those who have suggested that the lions share of this fiscal stimulus  package would be directed toward, you know, types of -- different types of  infrastructure projects and yet here he is coming out with what could be  tax cuts that far exceed those that President Bush put in twice during his  eight years as president.  I mean that's got to be a little bit of a  shocker.  </p><p> ERIN BILLINGS, \"ROLL CALL\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Well, Obama clearly is trying  to lead from the center.  And he knows he can't pass this if he doesn't  have Republicans on board.  They want tax cuts and he knows he needs them  to come on board and sign on.  So that's what we're seeing here.  </p><p> He's trying to come up with something that will appeal to the masses.   That's why he's taking the salesmanship directly to The Hill.  He's meeting  with these guys and he's saying, look, there's something in it for  everybody.  And he knows he's going to have to pass this with probably 80  votes in the Senate, and he wants a very strong majority in the House as  well.  This can't be a Democratic bill.  </p><p> GLICK: OK.  So, Peter, if we're talking about $800 billion, let's say for  the sake of argument, we know $300 billion is directed towards tax  incentives and loopholes and all those kinds of things, many of which are  for small business owners.  You tell me, when he has talked about 2.5  million, now up to 3 million either created or saved jobs, where does the  jobs component of this fiscal stimulus plan factor in?  Where are we going  to create those jobs? </p><p> MORICI: Well, if we spend money and we get people buying goods and services  again, we're going to get a multiplier effect.  If we spend $100 billion on  infrastructure, we'll get a $200 billion multiplier effect on GDP.  Bottom  line is, he has to raise GDP by about $330 billion to create 3 million new  jobs, which means he has to spend, in the first year, about $330 billion  because it takes some time to get the money out.  So look for a stimulus  package, if it's going to be consistent with this goal, of somewhere around  $350 billion spent in '09, and about $350 billion spent in 2010.  </p><p> GLICK: All right.  So, Erin, walk me through the Republican argument here,  because there are a lot of Republicans who are not to thrilled about this  concept here.  What do they not like about an $800 billion fiscal stimulus  package? </p><p> BILLINGS: Well, you just said it, $800 billion.  That's what they don't  like.  You know, the Republicans are trying to reclaim this fiscal  discipline mantle that they enjoyed for the last, you know, what, 40 years,  30 years.  They lost their way.  They're trying to find it again.  And they  need to prove to the American public that they know who they are.  And a  big part of that is maintaining that fiscal discipline.  They want to be  the check and the balance on this new administration.  So clearly that's  where it starts.  </p><p> Secondly, they want these tax provisions.  They've been pushing for that  behind the scenes.  It looks like they're probably going to get it.  </p><p> Thirdly, they want some time.  They don't want to just have this rammed  down their throats.  They don't want to look like they're rubber stamping  anything that the Obama administration is bringing to The Hill.  So they're  going to try and at least slow the process so they can have input and try  to at least get their imprint on it.  </p><p> And so I think what you'll see at the end of the day is, we will have some  kind of compromise proposal.  It's not going to be everything Obama is  laying out right now.  It's it's probably not going to get done till  February.  I mean if the Democrats are lucky, they'll get it right before  this February recess we're looking at, which begins on the 16th, I believe,  of February.  And Republicans are not going to sign on unless they get some  of their wants in there.  </p><p> GLICK: Well, and the good news is, at least a realistic expectations are  being set and we're preparing the markets by telling then.  </p><p> Peter, here's my opportunity, it's the new year, to get your assessment of  where this economy is headed.  This Friday we have probably -- arguably one  of the most important numbers.  We'll get the unemployment numbers for  December, non-farm payrolls.  Where is the economy headed? </p><p> MORICI: Well, in terms of numbers, we probably haven't seen the worst of  it.  GDP was only down a half a point in the third quarter.  Fourth quarter  GDP will probably be down 5 percent on an annualized basis.  And in the  next quarter, another 2 percent or 3 percent.  So we're likely to see job  losses continue through the first quarter.  </p><p> Also, if we get a stimulus package say by the end of February, we're not  going to get checks out to people until May 1.  And we're not going to get  any infrastructure spending till the second half of the year.  So if we're  looking for recovery in the economy, it's the second half.  </p><p> However, don't be too down on the stock market because the stock market has  factored this all in.  Economists have been saying this for quite some time  now.  And so my feeling is the stock market has bottomed out and it will  get its legs as long as the Democrat appear able to bridge the gap, reach  consensus with the Republicans, as long as they're confident that the  stimulus package is coming, businesses will see brighter prospects for the  second half of the year and the market will lead us out of the recession.   It won't be a lagging indicator, rather it will anticipate the recovery.  </p><p> GLICK: Erin, the 11th Congress goes into session tomorrow.  There's a lot  of new Democrats taking positions.  There's a perception out there that  President-elect Obama will accomplish more because he's got more Democrats  on his side.  But he's clearly made some significant gestures over the past  six weeks about what he's willing to do by walking across the aisle.  Will  they have success this year, not just for the fiscal stimulus plan, but  with accomplishing other major intended goals? </p><p> BILLINGS: Well, that's a great question.  I mean, as you know, Barack Obama  ran as a candidate of change.  He ran as a consensus candidate.  And now  he's going to try and govern as a consensus president.  That is a real  test.  It's very easy to talk the talk.  But now he's got to walk the walk.  </p><p> As you mentioned, he's been reaching out to congressional Republicans.   He's had his surrogates reach out to congressional Republicans in, you  know, in the weeks after he won the election on November 4th.  And now it  really gets down to bras tax.  </p><p> I mean the first real test is this economic stimulus.  If he can get this  through with bipartisan support, then I think that really is a harbinger of  things to come.  He's laid out a bunch of agenda items that are largely  consensus items, but the stimulus may or may not be.  So, you know, we'll  have to see.  It's going to take some time.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes, time will tell.  </p><p> BILLINGS: Yes.</p><p> GLICK: Yes, it's going to be very interesting because, you know, we sort of  put health care and a lot of the other top issues on the back burner, all  to talk about this stimulus program, which makes a lot of sense given the  current environment.</p><p> Dr. Peter Morici, happy new year.  As always, great seeing you.</p><p> And, Erin, stay with me because, Erin, you and I are going to talk about  one of the big topics going into this 111th Congress because the other big  story on The Hill is the man who's been tapped by (ph) Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich to fill Mr. Obama's vacant Senate seat.  Roland Burris will  also be on Capitol Hill this week to begin his new job.  Burris is facing  opposition because of the Blagojevich scandal to sell Mr. Obama's seat.  On  yesterday's \"Meet the Press,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who's  defended his right to block Burris' appointment, said anything could  happen.  Take a listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID GREGORY, \"MEET THE PRESS\": There sounds to me like there may be some  room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.  </p><p> SEN. HARRY REID, (D) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Hey, listen, David, I'm an old  trial lawyer.  There's always room to negotiate.  </p><p> GREGORY: All right.  So you're not saying no completely that he won't  serve?  That's what you're saying? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLICK: All right.  So what Burris will encounter in Washington and what  role his financial background may play, we go back to Erin Billings.  She's  the associate editor of the Capitol newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p> Erin, we only have just about 60 seconds here.  What do you expect to  happen in the coming days and how will that impact his ability to be sworn  in as senator of Illinois? </p><p> BILLINGS: Well, you know, as you know, the new Congress kicks off tomorrow.   Roland Burris has said he's coming to down.  The Democratic leaders are  going to meet with him on Wednesday and I think they're going to try and  kind of talk him down.  Tell him, hey, maybe you should just back off.   Let's see what happens with Governor Blagojevich.  </p><p> As you know, the general assembly is moving to impeach him.  I think the  Democrats would ideally like to have him ousted and then the lieutenant  governor could then make the selection.  But you're right, Harry Reid left  the door just slightly ajar.  And even though his aides are now saying,  well, there's not really room for negotiation.  He may -- you know, maybe  they're reading too much into it.  Certainly Harry Reid doesn't do things  on accident.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes.  No, I mean, it was interesting Harry Reid's comments there  yesterday.  He was really couching it.  But is there a chance that the  Senate will say no, you cannot take the seat? </p><p> BILLINGS: Well, I don't think there's really a lot of support to give him  the seat, even on the Republican side.  I mean the Republicans, Mitch  McConnell, the minority leader, said on Sunday on a different show that,  you know, that there should be a special election in Illinois to deal with  this.  And so everyone is looking at this cloud of corruption and no one  seems to think that this is the process by which they should appoint the  new senator from Illinois.  </p><p> So I think it would be a really heavy lift unless there was some kind of a  bipartisan deal.  Harry Reid is going to meet with McConnell this morning,  or today, to talk about the situation.  I think they're going to try and  figure out if there's a bipartisan road to go down.  But it's anybody's  guess.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, Erin Billings, thank you so much for sticking with us.   We appreciate it.</p><p> BILLINGS: Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break.  When we come  back, we'll talk more about what's going on in the Gaza Strip and what the  implications might be for Israel.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK: Welcome back.  </p><p> Well, the pressure is mounting on Israel to stop its 10-day offensive  against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  But Israel says the attacks will continue  until militants stop firing rockets at its citizens.  Fox New's David Lee  Miller is live on the Gaza border this morning with the very latest.  </p><p> Good morning, David.  </p><p> DAVID LEE MILLER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis.  </p><p> That's right.  The defense minister, Ehud Barak, paid a visit to some of  the troops on the front lines a little earlier today and he also said  today, speaking at the Connesset (ph), that the Israeli offensive is going  to continue until there is peace and tranquility along Israel's border with  Gaza.</p><p> Today, nevertheless, at least 24 rockets have been fired.  In fact, that  was the figure up until we went on the air.  Then shortly -- I'd say less  than 30 seconds ago, another rocket was fired off in the distance headed  into Israel.  So that makes at least 25 rockets that have been fired today.   A number of them literally flew over our heads.  One reaching as far as 25  miles into Israel, into the city of Beersheva.  </p><p> Meanwhile, on the ground, Israeli forces have effectively now surrounded  Gaza City.  Gaza City and its nearly half a million residents.  There has  been a great deal of fighting on the ground.  But for the most part, the  Israeli forces are staying out of the urban areas.  They are staying on the  outskirts of Gaza City.  </p><p> Hamas, meanwhile, is trying to draw them into the more urban environments  for some type of guerrilla conflict.  The Israelis say that they are  constantly moving on the ground.  In the words of one commander, they don't  want to be sitting ducks.  They are there to find the militants.  </p><p> Now, as for the death toll, the figures provided by Palestinian medics,  they say that as many as 60 Palestinians have been killed, only six of  which they say were militants.  The remainder, they say, are civilians and  many of them are children.  These are figures that we cannot independently  confirm.  As for the Israeli casualties, one soldier has been killed since  the ground incursion got underway. And as many as 40 have been injured.  </p><p> And, lastly, there is some progress to report on the diplomatic front.   We've got the EU involved, the French president involved, the United  Nations involved.  Perhaps the best hope for some type of diplomatic  solution here now, Alexis, is a delegation that has -- I am told we've got  another strike off in the distance.  You can see the cloud of black plume  of smoke.  </p><p> Let me finish making my point as you take a look at this latest Israeli air  strike.  A delegation of Hamas has left Syria, heading towards Egypt, for a  meting tomorrow.  It is expected at this meeting the Egyptians are going to  demand that Hamas move forward with the cease fire process and stop the  rocket attacks.  What influence they're going to have, that is somewhat  questionable.  Only a short time ago, before this conflict began, Egypt  asked Hamas to stop the rocket attacks.  Hamas ignored that request.  This  time around maybe they'll see things differently with Israeli forces on the  ground, in the air, and at sea, all targeting Hamas in Gaza.  </p><p> Alexis.</p><p> GLICK: David, I imagine, you know, just watching that bomb go off behind  you there, that you're in a very dangerous area there on the border in  Gaza.  Just give us some feeling of what's going on around you as we're  kind of watching this unfold.  I imagine this is pretty scary.  </p><p> MILLER: It's a little unnerving at first.  I won't say you get used to it,  but this is the way people live along southern Israel, and they have been  living for years with these rocket attacks a regular part of their lives.   But recently, because of the increase in these rocket attacks, life had to  change.  They've stopped school.  Parties have been stopped.  Social events  had to be rescheduled.  So there has been a significant change in people's  lives here.  </p><p> But for the most part, for most Israelis, life does go on.  This is  something they have to cope with.  They just have to change their daily  habits.  But when these rockets are launched, you've got 15 to 45 seconds  to take cover.  And let me tell you -- I'm losing my voice here -- that 15  seconds can be a very, very long.  You wait 15 seconds for that rocket to  hit and you just hope it's not going to land anywhere near you.  </p><p> Alexis.</p><p> GLICK: All right.  David Lee Miller, be safe.  Thank you very much, from  Fox News, for joining us this morning, bringing us up to date on this  story.  </p><p> All right, guys.  Well, from what's going on in the Gaza Strip, to what's  going on with the Bernie Madoff scandal.  Coming up next, we're going to  bring you up to date on the very latest on this 2:00 p.m. committee sub  hearing about what happened here and all the ties.  It's a terrible story.  But, of course, we'll bring you up to date on that in just a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WEBSTER: And welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Ashley Webster in  London, keeping track of the overseas markets for you.</p><p> And it's generally been positive, certainly in Asia overnight.  And we  started positively enough here in Europe, although perhaps not with a lot  of conviction.  But now sentiment has turned just a little more bearish.  </p><p> Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you in London.  We've been up  about a quarter to a half a percent for most of the day so far.  But now  we've turned negative.  We're down now about a half a percent on the FTSE,  down 28 points.  Also on the CAC 40 in Paris, down half a percent. And on  the DAX 30 in Germany, also down about a third of a percent.  </p><p> There has been some speculation, of course, of a big stimulus package being  passed by the Obama administration when it comes into power.  That gave  some impetus, if you like, to the Asian trading.  But so far into Europe  haven't picked up on that sentiment quite strongly, although we have seen  the higher oil prices lift some of the sectors.  The oil sector certainly  benefitting from that.  Although now we're seeing even the oil stocks turn  slightly negative.  Royal Dutch Shell down now 3 percent.  </p><p> We're also seeing some weakness in the European auto sector, including a  couple of downgrades today for both Renault in France and Porsche.  New car  registrations in France plunged in December, down 24 percent.  All of this  spelling more tough news for the automakers.  Renault down 5 percent in  Paris.  Porsche also down now 5 percent.  </p><p> We've also seen a lot of money coming out of gold.  Gold trading in London  down $26 an ounce to right around $853.  As a result, though, we've seen  the dollar get stronger against most of the foreign currencies, including  the euro and the British pound.  The dollar coming in right now at 1.44  against the British pound.  </p><p> All right.  Back to New York now and Jenna Lee for the latest news  headlines.  </p><p> Jenna.  </p><p> JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you so much, Ashley.  </p><p> And we begin with a sad story to update you on.  We could soon find out  what killed Jett Travolta.  Today, an autopsy will be done on the 16-year- old's body.  And it is believed at this time that he had a seizure and hit  his head on the bathtub.  Of course, Jett is the son of actor John  Travolta, and as well as actress Kelly Preston.  They released a statement  saying, \"Jett was the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask  for.  We are heart broken that our time with him was so brief.\"  So, again,  we'll keep you updated as we hear more.  </p><p> In the meantime, we're just going to turn to another story coming off the  weekend.  The new year's weekend box office went to the dogs this time.   20th century Fox's \"Marley &amp; Me\" held on to the top spot, pulling in just  over $24 million.  Disney's \"Bedtime Stories\" came in second with just  $20.3 million.  It was followed by Paramount's \"The Curious Case of  Benjamin Button,\" United Artists \"Valkyrie\" and Warner Brother's \"Yes Man.\"   All those rounding out the top five.</p><p> Also, Will Smith has been voted the top money-making movie star of 2008 in  the 76th annual Quigley Poll.  The star of Columbia Pictures, \"Seven  Pounds\" is the only -- the second African-American actor after Sydney  Poitier to top t he poll.  Robert Downey Jr. came in second and Christian  Bale claimed third.  </p><p> All right.  You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network.  Coming up,  we're going to take a look at one of America's greatest business rivalries.   It's the king versus Ronald McDonald.  The battle of two multi-billion  dollar companies continues to heat up.  Stay with us.  You don't want to  miss it.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p> This half-hour, we're going to take a look at the rivalry between  McDonald's and Burger King, two of my favorites.  And we're going to look  at the end of the road for retail giant Woolworth.  </p><p> And Fox 50 member Federal Express is raising rates as its shipping volume  continues to slip.  Will it affect the stock?  We'll talk about that.  </p><p> Take a quick look at the futures, as we're one hour away from the market  opening right now.  </p><p> The Dow is now down 50, we're down about half a percent.  The S&amp;P, as you  can see, is down about 6 points.  It's down about .6 percent.  And the  Nasdaq is also down about half a percent.  </p><p> We're at the lows of the morning.  We'll see how that shapes up as we head  closer to the bell.  </p><p> Now it is time for this week's edition of \"America's Greatest Business  Rivals.\"  </p><p> MCSHANE:  All right, Alexis.</p><p> In this week's edition of the series here ongoing, we do heat up these  burger wars, McDonald's and Burger King.  Burger King brought in $2.5  billion in the year 2008, while McDonald's earned $6.3 billion in the third  quarter alone.  So that kind of tells you how they stack up against each  other.  Certainly a lot of hamburgers no matter how you slice it.  </p><p> And while the two of them expand their empires here in 2009 to offer items  like lattes, even burger-scented body spray, apparently, we're going to  take a look back now at where these two rivals first fired up their grills.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCSHANE (voice-over):  The Big Mac versus the Whopper.  Flame broiled  versus grilled.  McDonald's versus Burger King.  It's one of America's  hottest business rivals that, after more than 50 years, shows no slowing  down in the fast food wars.  </p><p> Burger King and McDonald's burst onto the scene during the all-American  1950s.  Burger King set up shop in 1954 and McDonald's in 1955.  Since  then, they've taken each other on pound for pound.  </p><p> Over the past 50 years, they built franchise after franchise throughout the  world.  Burger King's signature burger, the Whopper, sizzled onto its menu  in 1957.  McDonald's fired off its Big Mac in 1968.  And the crispy, salty  fries, well, they have been perfected over the years.  Customers have  flocked to these rivals, partly because of all the choices and the  convenience, but they also haven't had to empty out their pockets to eat  there.  </p><p> The country's attachment to fast food didn't go unnoticed.  By the 1990s,  Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Subway were eating into these rivals'  marketshare.  And not much later, national obesity and nutrition concerns  became prominent.  </p><p> So these days, Burger King and McDonald's have expanded into healthy foods  and even list the calories on their menus in some states and cities.   Believe it or not, Burger King now offers veggie burgers and kids' meals.   McDonald's now includes salads and chicken sandwiches.  </p><p> Whether you have a beef with the burgers or you take a bite out of them,  deciding to own a franchise might be found in the numbers.  If you owned a  Burger King franchise in 2004, your sales could have reached $1 million.   And in 2007, sales could have risen to $1.2 million.  A McDonald's  franchise in 2004 could have earned you $1.6 million in sales, and three  years later you could have brought in $1.9 million.  </p><p> Would you buys a franchise today?  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MCSHANE:  All right.  So, for more on these burger wars, we're going to  send it over to Alexis.  </p><p> And to do so, I'm going to be back here, Alexis, in just a moment with some  news out of Apple, because Steve Jobs has just sent a letter out, which he  says, among other things, that he's been losing weight throughout 2008, but  the reason has been a mystery to him and his doctors.  We'll look through  that and get some more details in just a moment.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  No, I'm just seeing this press release coming out from the  board of directors.  </p><p> Great point there, Connell.  We'll cover that breaking news story in just a  moment.  </p><p> But let's finish up on the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King.  I  think I'm a fairly good expert on this.  </p><p> I'm joined by Sheri Daye Scott, editor-in-chief for \"QSR\" magazine, and  Steve West, the vice president of equity research for restaurants for  Stifel Nicolaus.  </p><p> Good morning, guys.  </p><p> Sherri, let me start with you.  </p><p> Burger King and McDonald's, it's a rivalry that has been legendary.  Where  does it stand right now?  </p><p> SHERRI DAYE SCOTT, \"QSR\" MAGAZINE:  Well, you know, McDonald's is number  one.  They've been number one for a long, long time.  But Burger King has  kind of carved its own niche into the market, and they're doing well in  that niche.  </p><p> The two are playing in different markets.  McDonald's is focusing on mom  and kids, and Burger King is focusing on those young edgy guys.  And both  are number one in those markets.</p><p> GLICK:  And so I imagine, Steve, that each of the two, Burger King and  McDonald's, they've figured out how to remain competitors in a marketplace  that they feel has enough room for each of them to be the dominant players.  </p><p> STEVE WEST, STIFEL NICOLAUS:  Yes, that's exactly right.  They've both,  over the last several years, have really evolved their menus to ad, as we  mentioned before, healthier type options.  </p><p> Now, is it healthy food?  I wouldn't go that far.  But when you can go to  McDonald's and get grilled chicken sandwiches, salad, you can go to Burger  King and get -- they call them apple fries, basically sliced apples, Mac  and cheese for the kids, they are focusing on healthy items, they are  focusing on premium items.  That helps drive those sales at the franchisees  that you mentioned earlier.  So things are doing very well.  </p><p> And when we think about the consumer here in the U.S., we typically spend  almost half of our food dollars every year at restaurants.  That trend  hasn't changed that much over the last couple of years, even in these  recessionary times that we're in.  </p><p> What we're seeing is people are trading down to fast food because of the  value, because of the convenience.  It's definitely a win-win for  McDonald's and Burger King right now.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes, and it's been reflected in their stock price even while this  recession, many suggest, began in the fourth quarter of last year.  </p><p> Sherri, let me turn to you, because their marketing strategies are very,  very different.  I mean, Burger King has this virgin Whopper thing going on  right now.  </p><p> How is it that they are a reflection of the company and who they are and  who they're trying to target?  </p><p> SCOTT:  Well, you know, to the point about what I mentioned earlier, the  two different marketing groups, Burger King realized McDonald's is going to  own those mom and kids, so about four or five years ago, they went after  the younger, more edgier crowd.  And Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky out in Miami  is really leading that charge.  </p><p> What they're doing is they're making people talk about Burger King.  The  Whopper, the virgin Whopper campaign, it's making people talk about their  preferences.  </p><p> Do you like the burger?  Do you like the Whopper?  Do you prefer the Big  Mac?  </p><p> Burger king has done a great job of just getting their name out into the  public, getting people to talk about Burger King, whether it's subservient  (ph) chicken campaign they did a few years ago where they had the dancing  chicken, whether it's the king in those kind of edgy and somewhat creepy  ads to people.  People are talking about Burger King in a way they probably  weren't five or six years ago.</p><p> GLICK:  So, Steve, you know, in the midst of this serious economic  downturn, each company is trying to do the right thing to differentiate  themselves in the international environment, in addition to the domestic.  </p><p> What are they trying to do to make sure that those marketshare numbers  continue to grow as not just the U.S. economy faces recession, but the  global economy faces a recession?  </p><p> WEST:  Well, they're doing really a lot of the same things.  If you look at  what McDonald's -- and I call it the McDonald's playbook, you know, when  they came out with their plan to win in 2003, really focusing on the  stores, making sure the stores looked nice, focusing on store level  execution, and getting that menu right, making it \"relevant,\" they're doing  the same thing in Europe.  </p><p> They're remodeling stores.  They shut down a lot of older, dirty looking  stores.  They're making the menu relevant.  You know, instead of just  taking a cookie cutter U.S. menu and applying it to Europe, as they used to  do, and the rest around the world, they're also making them -- they're  customizing the burgers and the chicken and the things like that with local  flare.  </p><p> GLICK:  Right.</p><p> WEST:  And that makes it relevant.  And they're also offering value.  So  they're really doing the same things around the world that they have been  in the U.S., and it's been very successful, even in these downturns that  we're seeing in Europe and Asia.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, guys.  Well, Sherri and Steve, we're going to leave it  there.  There's nothing more exciting than talking about the hamburger war  at McDonald's and Burger King.</p><p> Thank you, guys.  I'm starving now.  I'm like ready to go get some fast  food.</p><p> Thank you guys very much.</p><p> Well, we do have some breaking news surrounding the health of Apple CEO  Steve Jobs. I want to go back to Connell.  Connell has been following this  story for us.  </p><p> And Connell, I understand there is a statement coming out of the board of  directors as well.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes.  Two things here.  </p><p> One is a letter being sent out by Steve Jobs.  We talked before you started  that segment about the fact that he acknowledges the weight loss issues  that we've all seen when Steve Jobs has appeared in public within the last  year.  </p><p> He says that he has been losing weight.  And up until now, or up until  recently, that weight loss had been a mystery to him.  But now going over  some of the reasons in this letter that he has written, says the doctors  think they found the reason for it, and they expect it will take him until  late spring to regain the weight and body mass.  </p><p> Now, that reason, according to Steve Jobs and his doctors, is this -- he  says that they cite a hormone imbalance that has been, to quote from his  letter, \"... robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy.\"  So,  again, Steve Jobs saying his doctor says he has a hormone imbalance and  that is the reason he's been losing weight.  And they think that he can put  this weight back on, and he will continue as apple's CEO during his  recovery.  </p><p> He says the remedy for nutritional problems is a simple one and it's  straightforward.  And they've already begun the treatment for it.  </p><p> So on this news, it looks like the Apple stock is actually jumping up a  little bit in premarket trading.  We'll continue to follow that particular  angle of it.  </p><p> Now, you mentioned that the board of directors had put out a statement as  well.  They say, \"It's widely recognized both inside and outside of Apple  that Steve Jobs, one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the  world...\"   And they go over what they said in the past.  </p><p> They said if it ever comes to a day when Steve wants to retire, or for  other reasons can't continue as the CEO, you will know it.  That is  basically the answer that they've given us in the past.  </p><p> But again, Steve Jobs acknowledging the weight loss that he has had.  As  you see here in some of this video in which he face had looked drawn, a lot  of people had talked about that the last time he had appeared on stage.   And now saying it's because, Alexis, of a hormone imbalance and he is  taking treatment for that.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Connell, thank you very much for bringing us up to date  on that.  </p><p> We of course are going to continue to discuss it right now, because we're  going to switch gears here.  Richard Suttmeier is with me, and Charles  Payne is here with me to talk more about what the implications might be  here for Apple.  </p><p> You know, Charles, people have been saying for at least a year now that  they've got to come up with a succession plan.  Now, at least, we have some  sense as to what the illness that's affecting the man behind Apple.  But  will there be greater calls perhaps to have him do what Bill Gates did at  Microsoft, assume the chairman role and perhaps look for a future successor  in the CEO role?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Well, I think the street would like to know who the successor might  be, but I don't think anyone would like to see Steve Jobs step down if he's  capable of doing both jobs right now.  He is obviously the heart and soul  of the company.  That's why he's so important.  </p><p> You don't talk about any other individual in the company there or  associated with in this market more than Steve Jobs and Apple.  So this is  good news.  The stock obviously indicating a little bit higher.  </p><p> There's still going to be some rumblings, though.  A lot of folks are  saying, listen, you know, he suffered from pancreatic cancer.  That is  typically a pretty deadly disease.  And until this is totally resolved, we  see him put on weight, people are going to speculate.</p><p> GLICK:  Richard?  </p><p> RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM:  Well, I'm going to take it from the  standpoint of what Value Engine describes Apple computer.  It seems like  when it gets to an $85 handle, it becomes a buy-rated stock.  When it gets  into the $90s, it becomes a hold-rated stock.  </p><p> So this morning, from a trading perspective, I'm going to see how many  times this year I can make that same five to seven points.  So my  subscribers...</p><p> GLICK:  So it's range bound though.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  It's range bound.  And so I'm going to use this strength to,  say, book profits on a buy-rated stock that's now a hold.</p><p> PAYNE:  That's right, because our subscribers are in the stock, too, on an  average of about 86 bucks.  And I'm going to grapple with that as well  because, technically, it doesn't have a lot of resistance between here and  R100, but it comes down fairly quickly when it stops moving.</p><p> GLICK:  How much, guys -- I don't want to say is the bloom off the rose?   Because this is considered the darling in the tech world.  But in terms of  new innovation and new products?  Or is that just because, as my husband  said to me yesterday, we have Mac computers all over our house and you just  don't need to upgrade them as often because the fact of the matter is,  they're built terrific, they do the right things, and so you don't have to  upgrade them very often?</p><p> PAYNE:  Well, it's interesting you brought up Mac computers, because  everyone has talked about the halo effect from iPhones and iPods, and how  that would introduce audiences to the Mac computer.  People are looking at  this MacWorld Conference for something on the Mac PC.  That's what they  want to see, because they're doing exceptionally well in all other areas in  the business.  </p><p> We should also remind the audience, a pretty upbeat article in Barron's  over the weekend on Apple.  And this morning, (INAUDIBLE) Brothers also had  positive comments on them.  So the street and analysts liking what they're  seeing.</p><p> GLICK:  But Jobs isn't, as I -- right?  He's not doing the presentation, or  whatever, right?  </p><p> PAYNE:  He's not.  He's not going to be...</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> GLICK:  And that's the first time.  So some are going to suspect that if he  is not doing it, it's because either they're not excited about it or  perhaps that's why they put this release out today, is because he's now  being treated.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Well, I would agree with that.  He's being treated, and  hopefully the man gets well again and comes back out in six months with the  weight back on and announces another nano-nano, small-small device.</p><p> PAYNE:  But by the same token, you do at some point want other people in  the company to be associated with good news.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.</p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Yes.</p><p> PAYNE:  So hopefully whoever does make the presentation will say, \"Hey,  look at this.\"  And everyone will say, \"Wow!\" so that we're excited about  hearing from other folks.  You know, any corporation, though, if the CEO is  scheduled to speak and doesn't speak, the stock is going to get  slaughtered.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  I mean, that's the thing that concerns me here, is that, you  know, we've talked about this with the Warren Buffett situation as well,  when you desire as a shareholder some kind of succession plan.  </p><p> It doesn't mean it has to be put in place.  I mean, look, Wal-Mart decided  to do it at a time that some suggest, wow, why would you do it now?  But at  least something.  And I guess maybe we can read into who they select to do  the presentation.  </p><p> SUTTMEIER:  I mean, now it's \"Wow, but I can't afford it\" from the consumer  standpoint.  Let's see if I get my tax return.  I get a tax refund, maybe a  \"wow\" product, I'll spend it on that.</p><p> GLICK:  Except that they made this great deal with Wal-Mart, right, where  they're selling their devices.  So that's -- you know, everybody seems to  be moving in that direction.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  Everyone was pretty excited about it.  They seem to be doing  -- firing on all cylinders right now outside of the health issue with Steve  Jobs.</p><p> SUTTMEIER:  Right.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, guys.  We're going to leave it there.</p><p> Richard and Charles, thank you, guys, very much.  </p><p> Let's go to Ashley Webster in London and get a check and update on what is  going on in the overseas markets.  And he's also going to bring us up to  date on what is happening with Woolworths.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  Thank you, Alexis.  That's the big story.  </p><p> Tomorrow, the 600 remaining Woolworth stores will close in the United  Kingdom, bringing to a close an era of retail discounting.  Really, they  really were the original Wal-Marts, as one much my guests just referred to  it.  We'll get to that in a minute.  </p><p> Now, the U.S. stores that, of course, become synonymous with American  retail, the Woolworth stores in the United States even played a role in the  civil rights movement.  They began closing their doors though in the U.S.  some 29 years ago, converting in many cases to a new store, the Foot  Locker.  We'll explain how that happened as well.  </p><p> So for more on Woolworths' international legacy, I am joined by Sam Poser,  who is vice president and senior researcher analyst for Sterne, Agee &amp;  Leach.  And also joining me here in studio, Allyson Stewart-Allen, who is  director of International Marketing Partners.  </p><p> And Allyson, I'll begin with you.  </p><p> This really is the end of an era, isn't it?  But you would have thought  that someone like Woolworths were better prepared to handle an economic  downturn than many other stores.  </p><p> ALLYSON STEWART-ALLEN, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PARTNERS:  Yes,  you would have thought so.  And the thing that's fairly emotional for a lot  of British people about the closure of Woolworths here is the fact that  it's a store format that was quite innovative in its time.  </p><p> You know, the five and dime was something that in the U.K. was beforehand  not known.  You know, this time, with the Woolworths, you can go in, you  can choose what you want, it's very discount-oriented and invented the  discount category of retailing in the U.K.  So oddly enough, the fact that  it invented this category here, and now this innovator is no longer...</p><p> WEBSTER:  So what went wrong?  That's the question.</p><p> STEWART-ALLEN:  Well, that's a really good point.  What usually goes wrong  with retailers of al kinds, and in particular Woolworths, is the fact that  they didn't really keep up with who their customer was.  </p><p> So they changed their categories, they didn't merchandise very well.  They  didn't have the depth of ranges that their customers expected.  </p><p> The in-store experience became increasingly bleak as all of those around  them upgraded their offerings.  So they didn't keep up with the trends,  they didn't keep up with the in-store environment.  They didn't keep up  with the merchandise.  And all of that is a recipe for total disaster.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  Sam, let's go to you.</p><p> Woolworth closed its stores in the 1980s and '90s, closing the door on the  final stores in 1997.  So it's been some 11 years in the U.S.</p><p> How did this brand evolve into Foot Locker?  How did that come about?  </p><p> SAM POSER, VICE PRESIDENT, STERNE, AGEE &amp; LEACH:  Well, the last Woolworth  store closed -- Woolworth divested to Europe in 1982, and the last  Woolworth store closed in 1997.  It was just the evolution of the business  at the Woolworth Corporation, now Foot Locker Corporation, into an athletic  specialty business.  </p><p> And as that business became the dominant factor overall, Foot Locker spun  off the various businesses that didn't work quite as well for them.  And  now it's evolved into the world's largest athletic specialty retail chain.   </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  And Sam, given the current economy, how is Foot Locker  performing?  </p><p> POSER:  Well, Foot Locker's sales have been sort of stagnant over the last  few years, but they've begun to manage their businesses significantly  better than they have in the past.  The stock to sales ratio, inventory  levels and so on, have improved dramatically this year.  Basically, the  best ratio in about five years.  </p><p> We expect earnings to -- we're not looking for much earnings growth in the  next year or so, but we do see -- due to reduced top line.  However, we do  see the efficiencies improving dramatically and then beginning to take more  share.  They faced some problems recently because the athletic footwear  trend has been soft, but that's improving now.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.  Well, Sam and Allyson, I just want to ask you, very  quickly, five seconds, what kind of legacy does Woolworths leave behind?  </p><p> STEWART-ALLEN:  Interestingly, the granddaughter of Mr. Woolworth, Barbara  Hutton, had a house built in Regents Park called Winfield House.</p><p> WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p> STEWART-ALLEN:  And that is now the home of the American ambassador.  So  you can close the high street stores, but they're still here in another  form.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  The legacy lives on.  </p><p> STEWART-ALLEN:  It does.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.</p><p> Sam Poser, thank you very much for joining us.  </p><p> Allyson Stewart-Allen -- I want to call you Allyson Stewart-Allyson.  I  just like the word Allyson.</p><p> Thank you very much, anyway, for being here.  </p><p> STEWART-ALLEN:  Thank you.</p><p> WEBSTER:  All right.  When we come back, \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"   So don't go away.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p> We get started with Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p> Ashley, what do you have for us?  </p><p> WEBSTER:  Well, let me tell you, Alexis.  Today is somewhat of a sad and  interesting day.  And I'll tell you why.</p><p> It's the number one day for divorces to be filed.  In fact, this is the  busiest week of the year, and this is the busiest day of the busiest week.   And you know why?  Because the stress of the holidays is the final straw  that broke the camel's back, and today is divorce day.  So it's not very  encouraging, but somewhat interesting.</p><p> GLICK:  That is very sad.  How do you know that, Ashley?  </p><p> WEBSTER:  Yes.  I know.  Sorry.</p><p> GLICK:  That's not good.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  Sorry.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> PAYNE:  It's sad, but I'm impressed how fast it happens.  You know what?   \"What did you buy?  Oh, no!\"</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  \"How much money did you spend?  You're out!\"  </p><p> All right, Jenna, what is your one thing?  </p><p> LEE:  Well, the one thing is this Apple story.  I think this is the biggest  story of the day.  We had the stimulus plan, you had the auto sales, but  really how investors take in what is going on with Steve Jobs, I think  that's going to be the most interesting story to watch today, for sure.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  And his letter to shareholders was very passionate, very  forthright.  We're going to do more of that letter coming up on \"THE  OPENING BELL,\" but we'll show you it.  But it was pretty incredible.</p><p> PAYNE:  It is.  And, you know, he's just one of these incredible guys whose  story everyone knows, and a Horatio Alger-type story.  </p><p> But I think, also, this stimulus thing with President-elect Obama, the  notion of making tax cuts such an important part of this, just may be a  very brilliant move.  Gold has gone down a lot, the dollar is beginning to  rally.  I think international markets like the news, and I think a lot of  conservative investors in America like the news as well.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  It's going to change the ballgame.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.</p><p> GLICK:  I think it is.</p><p> PAYNE:  You know, he's taken bits from all -- he's taken bits from FDR,  Eisenhower and Reagan.  And...</p><p> GLICK:  I can't wait to see this report that you're writing.</p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  It's coming out great.  It's coming out great.  A lot of work  though.  I always bite off more than I can chew.</p><p> GLICK:  I'm so excited.  We're going to dedicate a lot of time to that,  because he's writing this really in-depth report about the first 100 days  for each of those presidents.</p><p> PAYNE:  Right.  And those are the three guys, I think, three presidents  that I think are going to be very important, their game plans and how  successful they were.</p><p> GLICK:  All right.  I look forward to it.  </p><p> All right, guys.  Well, before we go, we want to welcome San Diego, Cox  Communications in San Diego.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> PAYNE:  Whoa -- San Diego, too?  So we've got Connecticut, San Diego and  Vegas.</p><p> GLICK:  We've got -- yes, right?  We've got Vegas, we have San Diego, and  we have Hartford, Connecticut.  </p><p> Welcome, guys.  We're so excited to have you guys.  </p><p> All right.  Stay with us.  \"THE OPENING BELL\" is coming up next.  </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

We're going to  find out why and what it means for the Obama administration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And President-elect Obama rolling out a new stimulus package; he plans to  discuss it with lawmakers today.  We're going to have all the details.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session today  exploring Bernie Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme and how the SEC  missed it.  We're going to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p>And it may be too early for a hamburger, but we'll take a look at the  rivalry between burger giants, Burger King and McDonald's.</p><p>Today is Monday, January 5th, 2009.  \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right  now.</p><p>Good morning.  And welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  Happy New Year  everyone, I'm Alexis Glick.  Back in the seat and ready to go.</p><p>Well, we're going to get the latest on Governor Bill Richardson's stepping  away from his job as Secretary of Commerce in just a moment.</p><p>And the Madoff hearings begin today.  The House Financial Services  Committee will probe how it is that the SEC missed the scheme.  We're going  to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p>And what will 2009 look like for trading?  We get hopefully off to a good  start; at least so far.  We'll continue to see whether or not that will  work through.</p><p>And why would anyone want to start a new football league in this economy?   We're going to find out.</p><p>But first take a quick look at the U.S. futures this morning as right now  we're down 16 points; 8,942.  The S&amp;P right now down 1.60.  The NASDAQ down  2.75, but we had climbed above that 9,000 mark just late last week which we  hadn't been to since early November, we'll see whether or not it shapes up  to be a good year.</p><p>Well, let's get things started this morning with the three things you  should know.</p><p>President-elect Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats meeting today are  looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both  individuals and businesses.  This is an attempt to gain Republican support  for his more than $700 billion economic stimulus package.</p><p>And French President, Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with  Israeli and Palestinian authority leaders.  Now, the president is there in  an attempt to push for a cease-fire in of course, the war-torn Gaza area.</p><p>On the ground this morning Israel struck at new Hamas targets in Gaza as it  tries to rein in rocket attacks by the terrorist group.</p><p>And Microsoft's dominance on the Internet, well it may be waning.  The  software giant saw the share of its Internet browser Explorer drop from 74  down to 68 percent last month.  Making the biggest inroads -- Mozilla  Firefox which landed 21 percent of the market share.</p><p>All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p>Now, for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets,  we go to Ashley Webster in London.  Good morning Ashley and happy New Year.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR:  And happy New Year to you too  Alexis, and welcome back.  Good morning everybody.</p><p>We're off to a positive start and certainly in Asia overnight and so far in  Europe we are also moving higher although not exactly setting the world on  fire, but we are higher, and that's good.</p><p>London Exchange, the FTSE 100 up about a quarter of a percent, just a  little more than eight percent.  On the CAC-40 in Paris also higher by  about a tenth of a percent.  And on the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up about a  third of a percent.</p><p>Another iconic company falling victim to the credit crunch we find out this  morning Waterford Wedgewood, now this is a company announcing today that  it's calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The Irish group  best known for Wedgewood Pottery, Royal Dalton and Waterford Crystal  collapsed after talks over possible investment in this business failed.  It  has officially called in the administrators.</p><p>Meantime European automakers say they are taking aim at Detroit they've  said this before and failed.  Will it work this time?  Well, Volkswagen and  BMW of Germany are gearing up to expand market share in the U.S. in the  next few years.  VW, investing in, in its first U.S. factory in two decades  and expects to triple U.S. sales to one million vehicles by 2018; BMW  meanwhile, introducing a new small car and expanding its distribution  network.  We'll see how this works out.</p><p>Now, let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the  morning.  Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Hey, good morning, Ashley and thanks a lot.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on these U.S. automakers today; certainly the big  three from Detroit releasing their sales figures for December and the rest  of 2008 later on today.  And the numbers are expected to be pretty dismal  with American carmakers selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08; if that's  the case it would be the biggest drop since 1974.</p><p>When it comes to our foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW are actually  speeding towards an expansion in their stateside market according to a  report in \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning.  So that's an interesting  kind of twist in things.</p><p>And this week also kicks off two pretty big tech shows.  Apple is set to  unveil some new products today and tomorrow when Mac World kicks off in San  Francisco.  Investors will be looking into new gadgets as well as any kind  of insight at all into the health of the CEO, Steve Jobs, who has just  become an issue of late.  Jobs not expected to attend the MAC World this  year.</p><p>And on Wednesday night it should be pointed out the Consumer Electronic  Show begins out of Las Vegas.  I'll be there to cover the latest new  products later on in the week from CES.</p><p>Now, Pfizer is another one we're watching today, it's weighing a merger  deal with a rival drug company or it would weigh one.  The Financial Times  reporting the CEO Jeff Kindler says the world's largest pharmaceutical  company is quote, \"open to opportunities and constantly looking at those  which are big, small and in between.\"  Pfizer's stock price, well, we have  it is up behind you there 18.27 a share at the close; it's down almost 20  percent over that one year time span.</p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning.  Alexis, back over  to you Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  All right Connell, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson will not be joining the Obama  administration as Commerce Secretary.  Richardson pulled out yesterday  citing an ongoing federal investigation into a state contract awarded to  one of his political donors.</p><p>With more on this story we're joined by Michael Coleman the Washington,  D.C. Bureau Chief for the \"Albuquerque Journal\" which has been covering the  investigation for some time and Joe Monahan a New Mexico political veteran,  who now writes a blog about state politics.</p><p>Michael let me start with you.  Your newspaper reported on the  investigation back in August.  Apparently it has been on the docket now for  many months.</p><p>What type of relationship is it that Governor Bill Richardson has with this  financial company known as CDR Financial?</p><p>MICHAEL COLEMAN, ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL D.C. BUREAU CHIEF:  Well, their owner  David Rubin had contributed about $100,000 to a couple of Governor  Richardson's political action committees.  And right around the same time  that these donations were made the New Mexico Finance Authority, which is a  quasi governmental agency with board members appointed by Governor  Richardson, awarded this company a couple of contracts to help with some  really complicated financial transactions, bond sales, bond swaps, et  cetera.</p><p>One of those contracts was a no bid contract.  And another one of those  contracts CDR had issued -- had submitted the RFP but they weren't the top  bidder, they weren't the top scored bidder on that but they still got the  job.</p><p>GLICK:  So in other words, as I understand it, they were the second in line  of the bidders for the contracts so their suggestion here is this a pay for  play scandal.  On the other hand, Governor Bill Richardson's team says, we  did absolutely everything right.  In fact, the contract that we did with  CDR Financial worked out to have some really important profitability for  the state of New Mexico.</p><p>Tell me about that.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Right.  Now, they are very adamant about the fact that CDR saved  the state a significant amount of money.  And these bond swaps, these  complicated transactions that CDR specializes in was not part of the  original request for proposal.</p><p>But apparently New Mexico Finance Authority gave them points for that  nevertheless.  And it turns out they did one of those swaps.  The only bond  swap in New Mexico history apparently.  And Governor Richardson and his  team do say that that saved the state a lot of money.</p><p>GLICK:  Joe, walk me through the normal type situation here because as I  understand it, that there is a process for bidding out contracts like this,  but this one appears as though it was done sort of quietly.</p><p>Tell me why that adds even more speculation to the story.</p><p>JOE MONAHAN, NEW MEXICO POLITICAL BLOGGER (ON THE PHONE):  Well, there's  really no reason that we know why that the paperwork is not on file with  the state for this contract.  I know Michael's newspaper has reported on  that.  And that's one of the aspects of the investigation, just how this  deal was transpired.</p><p>The governor has run into problems down here before with contracts and  campaign contributions.  He's had to return campaign contributions several  times after the press has reported that the campaign contributor was given  a state contract.</p><p>So this pay-to-play situation has haunted Richardson somewhat, but not to  the scale that it has now because it obviously is a national story.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, Michael the $64,000 question that everybody is waking up  with this morning is they are wondering how it is if you have been  investigating this in your newspaper now, dating back to August, how it is  that the Obama administration didn't know that this could be an issue in  terms of his ability to take over this cabinet seat.</p><p>I mean what's the back end story here?</p><p>COLEMAN:  Yes, that is the $64,000 question today.  I think as you said, we  had reported this back in August.  I talked to members of the Senate  Commerce Committee in December and did a story.  And they said they were  aware of this.</p><p>You know, my hunch is that maybe they weren't aware of the extent to which  the FBI was looking into this.  I'm not sure exactly how the conversations  went between Governor Richardson's and Obama's transition team.  There was  some indications yesterday and some reports that maybe Governor Richardson  wasn't as forthcoming as they would have liked.</p><p>Richardson spokesperson denied that to us yesterday and said he was were  very forthcoming.  So maybe some of this will play out in the next 24 to 48  hours.  We'll see.</p><p>GLICK:  Joe, how does this play in New Mexico, I understand he has some of  the greatest ratings -- favorability ratings as a governor there.  And  could, if this investigation is put behind him, could he actually wind up  in another cabinet seat at one point?</p><p>MONAHAN:  Well, I think this has really hurt Richardson with Obama.  He's  not going to be hurt much in New Mexico.  He is a well liked governor.  He  was re-elected with a record amount of vote.  But Richardson has taken a  major hit nationally on this.  The cabinet positions are going to be  filled.</p><p>Also Ken Salazar is now the Department Interior Secretary designate; that  is an important Hispanic appointment that Obama has made so it puts less  heat on the administration when it comes to the ethnic aspect of this.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, well, Michael and Joe, we'll leave it at that.  Of  course, we'll continue to follow this story.  Thank you gentlemen, very  much.</p><p>COLEMAN:  Thank you.</p><p>GLICK:  Well, the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session  this afternoon.  They're exploring Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion  Ponzi scheme.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission's Inspector General could get a cool  reception after \"Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC  examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years.</p><p>Here for a preview of the House session, we're joined by Scott Garrett,  he's the Republican Representative of New Jersey who is a member of the  House Financial Services Committee and Harvey Pitt, former SEC Chairman and  Kalorama Partners CEO.</p><p>Gentlemen, good to see you.</p><p>Harvey, let me start with you.  \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting as we just  talked about the number of investigations over the past eight years; pretty  staggering statistics.  What does this say about their failure to do the  job?</p><p>HARVEY PITT, FORMER SEC CHAIRMAN:  Well, I think it reflects something  we've all thought might have occurred here, and that is the potential for  human failure.</p><p>There appears to have been a fair amount of warning to the SEC, and it  appears that when people looked into these issues, they came away without  concluding that anything wrong was going on.</p><p>I do think it's important to remember that this was a deliberate fraud, and  that Madoff was keeping a couple of sets of books.</p><p>GLICK:  So all right let me come back to that in just a second, Harvey.</p><p>Congressman Garrett, let me go to you, because I understand one of your  colleagues is running this, Congressman Kanjorski.  And the real story here  is he wants to figure out how did this situation occur in the first place?   Was this a lack of proper oversight, and what kind of regulatory reform  might it lead to?</p><p>Do you worry that it's going to lead to even more regulatory oversight than  we already have?</p><p>REP. SCOTT GARRETT, (R) NEW JERSEY:  Oh, we always have to worry about that  whenever the government is involved, there's always -- what is the term --  a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis.  A crisis as it were; obviously this is a  problem whether you are a large investor or middle-sized investor, a  private investor or small investor; a lot of people were significantly hurt  in this situation.</p><p>Now, to his credit, the Congressman Kanjorski made the comment I think  earlier this morning that there obviously is responsibility also on the  part of the investor in this situation.</p><p>That each investor has to make, you know, their own due diligence, if you  will, when they make their investments.  So you have to look at both sides  of the equation.</p><p>But back to your initial question, we have to be concerned whether  government comes back with a knee-jerk reaction with saying we're going to  give more authority, more power, more money into the very same agency that  was responsible and failed on the job.</p><p>GLICK:  So Congressman, as I understand it, the SEC's Chief, you know,  chief risk officer, their inspector is going to appear today in front of  Congress.</p><p>GARRETT:  Yes.</p><p>GLICK:  The number one whistle-blower though in this was originally  scheduled to appear and is now not appearing.  What do you hope to get out  of it, and why the change in the lineup?</p><p>GARRETT:  I can't give you an answer on the change in the lineup.   Obviously there are questions that we would like to have put there, say,  what did you know before and why hasn't the information come forth through  all the investigations that the SEC has made?</p><p>The other aspect of this as well as far as the outcome of the equation,  we'll have all these investigations.  We'll get all the information we  possibly can, but at the bottom line, where the government is not like the  private sector.  The private sector is such that if this occurred in the  private sector, where business failed to do what they were responsible for  doing, whether it's manufacturing something, or making something or turning  a profit, that business at the end of the day would be out of business.</p><p>But when government is involved, the normal reaction to it is to do just  the opposite.  Throw more money, put more regulation on in place, and we  saw that with the Enron situation and Sarbanes-Oxley.  We came back with so  much more regulation in place, that it actually was a detriment to business  going forward -- </p><p>GLICK:  Right.</p><p>GARRETT:  -- as opposed to a benefit to them.</p><p>GLICK:  Harvey, let me go back to you because one of the things you touched  on as you answered my first question is the fact of the matter is we now  understand there have been offshore accounts.  There may be many offshore  accounts.</p><p>What would the SEC know or not know in that situation?  I mean, you know,  look, people are going to think this is egregious in how the SEC missed  this but are you telling me that because there might have been offshore  accounts, there could have been loopholes or opportunities for the SEC to  miss it?</p><p>PITT:  Well, the SEC has had a lot of experience in dealing with offshore  accounts.  Obviously there's bank secrecy and problems with getting all  that information, but the critical function here was to go in and examine  Madoff's operations, his books and records.</p><p>And I believe picking up on something the Congressman said, that it's  physically impossible for any agency of government to do what we are  expecting them to do.  That doesn't excuse this particular situation.</p><p>But there are 11,000 registered investment advisors, and the SEC has 3,700  people on its staff.  There's no way the SEC can continuously review these  people.  And so what's required is a whole new paradigm for dealing with  inspection and examinations, and it has to be done quickly.</p><p>GLICK:  You know, I don't know if you got a chance, Harvey, to see an  article in the New York Times, the Sunday New York Times yesterday, an  opinion article written about what needs to change at the SEC.  But one of  the key things that is talked about in this article is whether or not  there's just too close a relationship between Wall Street and the role of  the top risk officer, top inspectors at the SEC who exchange jobs between  becoming a chief risk officer at the Wall Street firm and the SEC.</p><p>How do we make sure that we learn some valuable lessons here and that we  don't allow something like this which involved this many investigations to  go unnoticed?</p><p>PITT:  Well, I think what you have to do is change the entire structure of  examinations.  That's what's the problem.  You can't take some kids right  out of college who are being paid $50,000 or $60,000 a year and ask them to  examine $50 billion hedge funds.</p><p>What you need to do is have a completely different system, one that we  proposed back in 2003 but which hasn't yet been adopted, and I think would  solve a lot of this problem.</p><p>The SEC has to do a much better job of setting the standards and requiring  independent examinations with reports both to the firm reviewed and the  SEC, and then the SEC's personnel can go in and look at the issues that  have been uncovered.</p><p>I think otherwise we're going to be just setting the SEC up for failure -- </p><p>GLICK:  Right.</p><p>PITT:  -- on a continuing basis.</p><p>GLICK:  All right gentlemen, we're going to leave it there.  I know this is  going to a hot topic, Congressman Garrett, Harvey Pitt, as always great  pleasure seeing the two of you.</p><p>All right guys, coming up we're going to go live to the Gaza Strip with the  latest on Israel's ground assault and escalating tensions in the Gaza area.</p><p>And this latest Mideast conflict has oil experts worried.  We're going to  tell you why in just a couple moments.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Welcome back.</p><p>Well the fighting in Gaza continues.  Israeli troops on the ground pushing  deeper into the region.  Dominic Waghorn of Sky News is live at the Gaza- Israeli border with the very latest.  Dominic, good morning.  Bring us to  up-to-date on the very latest.</p><p>DOMIC WAGHORN, SKY NEWS:  well, the fighting is continuing in Gaza.  The  ground force operation continues on three fronts.  The Israelis have been  fighting with Hamas in the south.  They are targeting the smuggling tunnels  there that Hamas have used to smuggle in weapons from Egypt.  They have  been hit with aerial bombardments and the Israeli forces are now on the  ground fighting Hamas there.  An armored column, a big armored column of  somewhere between 100 and 150 tanks -- and armored personnel carriers has  pushed right the way through the sea and is occupying land that effectively  splits Gaza in two.</p><p>That means Gaza city which you will be able to see behind me if it wasn't  for the haze is now encircled by Israeli forces.  The fiercest fighting  though, I think, has been in the area behind me.  That's the north most bit  of Gaza around the refugee camp of Jibalia (ph) and the town of Bethleher  (ph).  The reports are very close to fighting, house to house combat.   According to one reports, hand-to-hand fighting in tunnels underneath those  houses where an Israeli soldier was nearly abducted but was able to escape.   There's no letup in the pace of this action.</p><p>GLICK:  Dominic, talk to me about the humanitarian costs of all of this.  I  know the French president Nicolas Sarkozy is supposed to travel there  today.  What are the implications here?</p><p>WAGHORN:  yeah, the Americans have stood full square behind the Israelis on  this not critical of it but the British governments and the French have  been critical of this ground invasion.  And the main reason for that and  the mounting concern is this humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian  death toll.</p><p>Around 500, over 500 people have been killed by this in Gaza.  And we don't  know how many of them are civilians, but we think at least a quarter of  them, many of them women and children.  There were reports today of three  children being killed in a house, for instance, near that armored column  with one tank shell.  Another artillery shell wiped out a family of seven  to the north of Gaza city.</p><p>The death toll yesterday was 40 and halfway through the day we're heading  towards that number again today.  The Israelis though say they have no  alternative but to carry out this operation.  What they are not saying is  how much longer it will go on for.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, Dominic, we will leave it there.  Thank you very  much for bringing us up-to-date on the very latest.  Of course be safe.   Now let's send it over to Charles.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well as the ten day assault escalates the price of oil continues to tick  upwards; right now crude trading around $46.  It had approached $47 earlier  as some Islamic countries say that oil should be used as a weapon.</p><p>With a closer look at how the conflict is affecting oil, I'm joined by Phil  Flynn, Fox Business contributor, vice president and senior market analyst  for financial firm Alaron Trading.</p><p>Phil, the first question, Israeli troops are now on the ground in Gaza.   Can we expect this to continue to move the price of crude oil higher?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING:  Not necessarily to be honest with you.  I  think this is an emotional reaction to the market.  I don't think anybody  really believes that OPEC or other oil-producing countries are going to use  oil as a weapon in this situation.  But there is no doubt that  psychologically on light volume it did drive this market higher.  I don't  think it's sustainable.</p><p>PAYNE:  Having said that, do you think that -- looks like earlier today we  saw $47, it is pulling back a little bit, is there a ceiling right now that  oil can go to?  I mean it's made a huge move off of $33.</p><p>FLYNN:  It really has.  We're talking in three days on light volume.  And  really what started this move was the news out of Russia and the Ukraine.   So this is really I don't think geopolitical driven at all.  I think it's  more optimism about the new year.</p><p>Really what drove the market was this incredible start to the year that we  had with the stock market turning around, so I think we're seeing a mood  change in the market somewhat.  For oil to technically confirm that this is  a reversal will have to close above $50 a barrel, but I think that's going  to be a tough job today unless the stock market performs magnificently.</p><p>PAYNE:  Phil, we have talked about these geopolitical events.</p><p>Let's talk about the stimulus package here.  What impact is the Obama  stimulus plan having on oil and what will it do for oil as the year goes  on?</p><p>FLYNN:  I think in the short-term it's creating little bit of optimism, and  if you get optimism, that can turn the market around a little bit.  And  it's amazing how quickly it's changed.  I mean, if you look back at just,  you know, New Year's Eve, oil prices were at $33.  It was doom and gloom.   All of a sudden, boom, we're starting to feel optimistic again and that, in  and of itself, can turn oil around.</p><p>PAYNE:  All right.  Well thanks a lot Phil.  Really appreciate your time  this morning.</p><p>FLYNN:  Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE:  Coming up, we're about almost two hours away from the first full  trading week of the new year getting underway.  We will see if the Dow's  rally on Friday can continue; 258 points, that was a big one.  Looking for  an encore.</p><p>More \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER:  Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Ashley Webster in  London keeping an eye on overseas trading on this the first full week of  trading in 2009.</p><p>So far so good; we've seen generally a positive day of trading in Asia  overnight.  And so far in Europe we're in the green, although not with a  lot of conviction, it has to be said.  We're up about 7 points on the FTSE  100.  Essentially flat now in Paris on the cac-40.  Up about a quarter  percent in Germany on the Dax 30.</p><p>News today of another iconic business that's fallen victim to the credit  crunch.  Waterford Wedgewood announced today that it is calling in the  administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The group best known for  Wedgewood pottery and Royal Dalton of Waterford Crystal collapsing after  talks over a possible investment in the business failed.  This Irish  business dates back to 1759 -- a sad day.</p><p>Meantime, in the oil business, Saudi Arabia may well be laying the  groundwork for a sizable reduction in crude oil shipments.  Many members of  OPEC just seem reluctant to commit to the group's pledge to cut output.  So  Saudi Arabia likely to take the lead in acting to shore up sagging oil  prices.</p><p>Crude prices by the way are higher today.  That is giving a boost to the  oil stocks, but even here we're being a little mixed.  BP up one and a half  percent in London, but Royal Dutch shell down two percent.</p><p>We've also seen money coming out of gold, down 17 percent in London -- $17  that is per ounce in London trading.</p><p>Mining stocks doing okay but turning rather mixed as well.  Rio Tinto up  one and a third percent.  Xstrata, another big mining company up three and  a half percent.  But you know what, the U.S. dollar, stronger this morning;  up against both the euro and the British pound that means the pound now at  $1.45.</p><p>That's the very latest from European trading.  Now let's go back to New  York for the latest headlines with Jenna Lee -- Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you very much, Ashley.  Good morning  once again everyone.</p><p>It could be a showdown on Capitol Hill.  Roland Burris is headed to  Washington today and plans to be sworn in as the junior senator from  Illinois along with the rest of the new senators which happens tomorrow.   But Democratic leaders have said they won't allow Burris on the senate  floor.</p><p>He was appointed of course by tainted Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich who  is accused of trying to sell the seat; the seat that he is supposed to take  over to the highest bidder.  Burris says his appointment is perfectly legal  and denying him entry to the senate would be denying the people of Illinois  their rightful representation.</p><p>We will have much more on Burris's controversial appointment on the next  hour of \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" by the way.</p><p>Continuing with policies now, Democratic Al Franken is also hoping to be  sworn in as a new senator tomorrow.  Minnesota state canvassing board is  expected to declare Franken the winner of one of the closest, most hotly  contested and longest senate races ever.</p><p>Franken has beaten incumbent Republican Norm Coleman by 225 points.  That's  out of nearly 3 million votes cast.  But Coleman has a number of possible  legal challenges left, including contesting the entire recount.  Because of  that, it's unlikely that Franken, of course the former \"Saturday Night  Live\" star, will be sworn in with the rest of the new senators tomorrow,  but we shall see.</p><p>Some people are trying to cash in on the Bernie Madoff scandal, EBay is  full of items featuring the Madoff's securities logo.  There's this fleece  jacket which the seller says is a piece of history; top bid right now, $510  for that.  Check out this hat from the Madoff securities golf tournament  from 2003, right now it's going for $217.50.</p><p>A steal, a bargain?

And Fox Business welcomes Charter  Communications and Cox Communications in Hartford Connecticut.  Hartford is  the insurance capital of the world.  We welcome you Hartford.</p><p>We're going to take a look at how the economy is impacting the insurance  industry when \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  </p><p>In this half hour we're going to take a look at how the insurance industry  is faring in this economy.  We're going to take a look at a new football  league -- I know it's hard to believe -- and how they plan to compete with  the NFL.  And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill today.  Much more on what  could happen in that hearing later at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.  </p><p>Well, the first full week of trading in the new year gets under way in less  than 90 minutes.  And investors are hoping Friday's 250-point gain is just  the beginning.  </p><p>Let's see how things are shaping up this morning.  Take a look at the  futures.  As you can see right now, the Dow is down 6 points.  The S&amp;P is  pretty much unchanged.  NASDAQ right now is up just a couple points.  It's  actually two hours before things get started.  </p><p>I said 90 minutes, but you know I'm getting excited.  </p><p>So what will 2009 mean to Wall Street?  </p><p>Richard Suttmeier is the founder of the stock valuation Web site  ValueEngine.com and Charles Payne, WStreet.com founder and FOX Business  contributor.  </p><p>Good morning, gentlemen.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK:  Happy new year.  It's good to see you, guys.  We're back with  another year.  </p><p>All right.  So Charles, there is so much to talk about.  It's hard to know  where to begin.  But I guess the most important thing for people at home  right now is, is this a good place to dip your toe in the water?  </p><p>I mean do we start 2009 thinking I want to be an investor?  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, you know what?  I think --  I start 2009 thinking I want to be a trader.  You know, whether or not you  dip your toe in for the long -- listen, here are two thing.  If you're  really the type of person that's going to consistently put money into the  market, fine, don't stop doing that because you'll eventually -- you will  be buying at the bottom.  </p><p>If you're that person who's been sitting on about 40 grand, waiting for the  right moment, if you're willing to be nimble, then this is the time.  If  this -- if you think this is the time to buy and hold, you may have a  better opportunity down the road.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, nimble.  Now my man Richard over here is hyperventilating.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I know.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  He's like -- he's (INAUDIBLE) what's good about this.  So, Richard,  you're my technician and -- you do a lot of work on this.  And you're not  very bullish.  Tell me why.  </p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM CHIEF STRATEGIST:  Well, over the near  term it's -- the market is fine.  It's in good shape.  And we started out  with a 3-percent gain for the Dow on Friday.  So that's kind of like our  handicap for the week, if you will.  </p><p>I think, I think the Dow is trying to get up to the Election Day high,  which was 9654, something like that.  That's when President Obama or soon- to-be President Obama got elected.  And so that was the good news.  </p><p>Then we had the cascading of bad news that took us down to 7450.  So that's  kind of a trading range.  And we're trying to get back to that Obama high  by inauguration.  </p><p>GLICK:  But you think we will retest those lows?  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  I think, in the second half of the year, we'll go to lower lows  because the second half recovery of 2009 will be as strong as the second  half recovery we had in 2008 which everybody was talking about a year ago.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, and didn't really happen.  </p><p>You know, Charles, a lot is resting on this stimulus package, you know, to  the tune of 800 billion, President-elect Obama is meeting with officials  today on the Hill about it.  Now we're hearing about $300 billion in  proposed tax cuts.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>GLICK:  I mean, he's starting to really appeal to those blue dog Democrats  and making sure that he's putting things in this package that are going to  make Republicans and the blue dog Democrats happy.  </p><p>How important is this package?  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think it's very important.  You know, I'm working on a -- on a  report right now for our subscribers, and I'm comparing his first 100 days  in his -- in his presidency to three presidents, FDR, Eisenhower, Ronald  Reagan, because those are three guys who came in with very serious, ugly  economic situations and had to make bold moves.  </p><p>It's really a sort of a pleasant surprise, to be honest, that they've been  talking about tax cuts to this degree.  I would like to see him even  friendlier to business.  I'd like to see him give businesses a break.  </p><p>Multinationals, allow them and bring money that they make overseas back  into American without these onerous tax penalties, because that's one of  the things that George Bush did that actually, in my opinion, worked, the  Jobs Creation Act of 2004.  It did create jobs and it brought a lot of  money back to our shores.  </p><p>So I think Wall Street is going to be excited about that.  What's going to  be intriguing today is -- today is to see how the infrastructures react to  this news, because before it was like a trillion just to repair roads,  maybe it won't all go to that.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  Yes.  Well -- and part of the Obama camp situation is they  need to provide things that are actually going to stimulate the economy and  not long-term stimulate but short-term stimulate.  </p><p>How do you feel about these new tax cuts?  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  I think that that...</p><p>GLICK:  They're not new actually.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Well...</p><p>GLICK:  Some of them will be.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  I know, but I mean, come Friday and we see a loss of 500,000  jobs and a 7 percent unemployment rate and the fact that the economy in  2008 lost 2 million jobs, that's going to be hard to stomach in this  environment.  </p><p>And we need help from the housing market.  Mortgages need to be redone.   And we have not addressed that.  That's what I've been saying for a year.  </p><p>GLICK:  This is your -- this is your mortgage mulligan that you...</p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Absolutely, 100 percent.  </p><p>GLICK:  So just before we go here, you tell me, the -- what is the  quickest, easiest way to solve the housing problem.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Give everybody a mortgage mulligan, a do-over, and I mean the  billions of dollars and trillions of dollars that we spent in 2008, if we  had had done this a year ago, realizing that there was a problem in the  housing market and people needed help making their monthly payments, we  wouldn't be in the predicament we are today.  </p><p>GLICK:  Who pays for the mortgage mulligan?  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Who's paying for all the other stuff?  </p><p>GLICK:  Uncle Sam.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Exactly.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Uncle Sam.  I mean it -- it's not easy to determine who's to  bailout -- who to bail out.  But any problem is solved from the source.   What started all of this?  Bad mortgages that shouldn't be given to people.   House prices that way -- that were way too high.  </p><p>No one's addressed yet the fact that we still have $617 billion in  construction and development loans.  That's another 3 million homes that  are on the books of the bank in terms of loans to builders and developers.  </p><p>GLICK:  That could fail, yes.  </p><p>All right, guys, we're going to -- we have to leave it there.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Right.  </p><p>GLICK:  Richard, I know you're excited about this and -- give me that TARP  list.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  I just want you to know that Richard does more homework than  anybody I know.  He sends us the best research.  He has a five-page list  here in the TARP program of what we, the American taxpayer, own.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Look at how little the lines are for -- these are all the companies  that we own as taxpayers.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Over 200 banks; right?  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  282 banks now.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p>GLICK:  But who's counting?  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  And seven of them are private banks.  How -- I couldn't even  buy one of these if I wanted to.  </p><p>GLICK:  282 and counting.  All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.  </p><p>Well, we want to welcome our newest viewers on Cox and Charter  Communications in Hartford, Connecticut.  That city is known as the  insurance capital of America.  Home to insurance giants the big ones, Aetna  and the Hartford.  </p><p>You know the insurance industry pumps about $12 billion into Connecticut's  economy and competes with other states such as Iowa for insurance payrolls  and tax revenues.  </p><p>With more on the state of the insurance industry and Hartford, I'm joined  by Thomas Sullivan.  He is Connecticut insurance commissioner, and Bob  Hartwig is president and economist for Insurance Information Institute.  </p><p>Good morning, gentlemen, thanks for being here.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning.  </p><p>GLICK:  Tom, let me start with you.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Good morning.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know we're in the midst of a very serious economic downturn.  A  lot of talk about the insurance industry in the wake of what happened to  AIG last year.  </p><p>What is this face of it?  How -- how is it shaping up to look in 2009?  </p><p>THOMAS SULLIVAN, CONNECTICUT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER:  Well, the insurance  sector has felt some of the pinch of the general economy, quite frankly,  the insurance sector has been a little bit more depressed than general S&amp;P  and some of the broader indexes.  </p><p>But, overall, the -- industry is in good shape.  We haven't had any major  insolvencies.  We haven't had really any insolvencies.  And when you point  out AIG, I would point out to you that AIG, its frailty has occurred in its  holding company which is not regulated by state regulators like myself.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, Bob, when we talk about insurance, we can go in so many  different directions, obviously.  There's life, there's property, there's  casualty, but one thing the insurance industry normally does very well is  it prepares for risks or shocks to the system.  </p><p>Has it been better prepared than perhaps the rest of the financial arena,  particularly what we saw in 2008?  </p><p>BOB HARTWIG, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE:  Well, absolutely.  Every day  the insurance industry has to assume that the worse case scenario could  happen, whether it's something like a 9/11, or a Hurricane Katrina, or a  stock market wash out.  </p><p>Sometimes all these happen -- happen at the same time.  So we're prepared  for that.  So just take a look at the numbers.  In 2008, 25 banks failed.   Not a single insurance company failed as a result of the financial crisis,  and so I think that's a very important distinction.  </p><p>So at the end of this, I think that we'll see the insurers emerge with  their risk management model which is one where we always retain some of the  risk, we don't pack it off, sell it off to the securities markets and  forget about it.  We retain the risk, we have skin in the game every inch  along the way.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK, and Bob, we should also differentiate, too, between life  insurance and property and casualty, because I imagine that life insurance  in a recessionary like environment like this would feel some heat because  in essence it is one long-term source of an investment vehicle.  </p><p>HARTWIG:  Well, that's right.  Some insurers can invest -- life insurers  can invest for a longer term so they may be sensitive to fluctuations in  different types of asset prices.  That has happened but nevertheless they  do build up very strong capital positions, designed to be resilient in  market downturns.  </p><p>The industry is very, very heavily regulated.  It's also one that's fairly  transparent.  Have there been some short sellers having their way for times  -- for periods of time in the market?  That has happened.  But the reality  is insurers are writing new policies paying claims just as they did before  the crisis hit.  </p><p>GLICK:  And, Tom, let me go back to the state of Connecticut.  We talked  about two of the largest insurers in the world, Aetna and Hartford, but  you're also seeing competition with places like Iowa trying to get big  insurers in there.  </p><p>What are you doing on a state basis right now to make sure that this  remains the capital of the insurance industry?  </p><p>HARTWIG:  Well, our -- hallmark has been insurance in terms of our economy  and the state of Connecticut, Governor Rell and her administration have  focused a lot of attention on the industry.  </p><p>We've set up through the metro Hartford alliance effectively our chamber of  commerce here in Hartford, an insurance and financial services cluster so  that we can continue to leverage the talent that Connecticut has to be able  to deliver to the insurance industry.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, Tom and Bob, we're going to leave it there.   Thank you, gentlemen, very much.  </p><p>HARTWIG:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Coming up, in today's economy, why would anyone want to  start a new football league?  Well, the Arena Football League folded its  operations but now a new league plans to compete with the NFL.  We're going  to talk to United Football League commissioner coming up next.  </p><p>And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill this morning.  We're going to find out  what changes might be in store for the SEC when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.  Stay with us.  We'll be back in a few minutes.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Well, this past weekend the road to the Super Bowl kicked off with  the NFL playoff.  I was glued to the television as usual.  </p><p>Well, although the economy is down, sports economists expect the NFL to see  an increase in the league's 2007 revenues which exceeded $7 billion.  Those  numbers have a couple of former finance executives thinking that there may  be room for more pro football so they formed the United Football League.  </p><p>It has six cities ready to go and is talking about giving fans an IPO  investment in those franchises.  </p><p>Here with the details on their deal I'm joined by UFL founder Bill  Hambrecht.  He's the CEO of the financial services firm WR Hambrecht and  Company.  And Michael Huyghue.  He's the commissioner of the UFL and a  former NFL executive.  </p><p>Michael, let me start with you.  There are a lot of people out there who  say how could you consider doing something like this in this economy,  particularly given what we have seen with the football, the Arena League  which just folded?  </p><p>Tell me a little bit about it and why you think you can do it.  </p><p>MICHAEL HUYGHUE, UNIFIED FOOTBALL LEAGUE COMMISSIONER:  Well, I'm a  passionate football fan.  And  I think there's millions of passionate  football fans.  You just mentioned, you're watching the NFL games.  </p><p>Our league is really a great opportunity for the spillover of talented  football players to get an opportunity to play.  </p><p>Kurt Warner is a classic example of a player who was sort of missed in the  original selection of players in the NFL and he's had a prosperous career.   There's hundreds of those type of players.  And we just want to provide  those opportunities as well as for coaches and front office executives.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, Bill, you were known for what you have done in the  investment and the Wall Street community, and here it is,. you're starting  a football league.  It doesn't necessarily go together.  </p><p>Tell me why you wanted to do this.  </p><p>BILL HAMBRECHT, UFL FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN:  Well, I thought there was a great  attraction to having a football franchise owned by the public and by the  fans and by the people who live in, in the city where the franchise is  located.  </p><p>So to me the -- my world of finance and IPOs and the football world came  together.  </p><p>GLICK:  So Bill, so tell me how that works?  Because you're talking about a  stake, many people will liken to what happens with the Green Bay Packers,  for example, but tell me how will this situation work.  </p><p>I understand it'll be in as many as sixteen and  cities to start.  </p><p>HAMBRECHT:  That's correct.  There will be six cities, six independent  franchises, and each franchise will be financed by local people, both  private investors and public investors.  </p><p>GLICK:  So Michael you have, as we mentioned in the very beginning, you're  a former NFL executive.  You know what works in the football world, in the  football community, and this is a different idea at a time when most people  would say how could you possibly get the funding?  </p><p>How do you get the participation?  How do you get the players and the --  money to pay them the necessary salaries?  Walk me through.  </p><p>HUYGHUE:  Sure.  </p><p>COLLINS:  How are you putting this all together.  </p><p>HUYGHUE:  Well, you know, it's an interesting time.  </p><p>Clearly the economy is a tough time, but there are a number of people that  are looking for opportunity.  And our league is one of innovation.  We are  finding people that are excited about football in their markets that don't  have NFL franchises to support.  </p><p>They believe in the concept that there's a lot off talented football  players out there.  And so they're putting groups together.  Each franchise  is run by a chairman and he has five or six or seven local independent  investors with them.  </p><p>An d they're funding about $60 million to operate this franchises.  We have  about a $20 million player salary cap and we're going to get some exciting  players.  You know, I ran, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for the first seven  years and I saw the same type of players I think we'll get in our league.  </p><p>GLICK:  And Michael, I have heard rumblings that you would even consider,  perhaps if you could, trying to attract somebody like Michael Vick now that  that Ryan is over at the falcons at the falcons and doing fairly well, one  could argue -- doing well until this weekend.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Sure.  </p><p>GLICK:  But -- is that true?  </p><p>HUYGHUE:  Well, it's going to be a league of opportunity.  And we're  certainly going to let the fans have a say in almost everything we do.  In  fact, we're putting up on our Web site Vick or no Vick?  And he'll be one  example of many players that will consider, of course, players like that  have some interesting backgrounds, considerations that we'll have to  consider.  </p><p>But there's going to be a league of opportunity, and certainly he'll be one  example of many players we will consider.  Players like that have  interesting background considerations that we will have to consider.  It is  going to be a league of opportunity.  Certainly he will be one  consideration.  </p><p>GLICK:  Bill, you know, I guess the number one thing you guys have to  figure out is how you are going to differentiate yourself given  particularly what has happened with the Arena Football League.  </p><p>You tell me, how are you going to do that?  </p><p>HAMBRECHT:  Well, I think the big differentiation is that we're going into  markets that the NFL is not established in or is leaving.  So -- you know,  basically the NFL has done a lot of things really well.  They, they have a  great product.  They have a great sport.  And they have, you know, just  done a wonderful job of implementing.  </p><p>But they have not expanded into some of the major growth areas of the  United States.  I mean, it is amazing when you think about it that Los  Angeles does not have its own franchise.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p>HAMBRECHT:  Nor Las Vegas.  </p><p>GLICK:  So true.  You know, Michael, before I let you go, I understand some  big announcements will come during Super Bowl week, and that is it by as  early as March 1, we will know the teams, and you'll start, you know,  having people try out?  </p><p>HUYGHUE:  Yes, exactly right.  We will have an announcement around Super  Bowl week announcing the six owners and general managers and presidents.   We already have a $20 million training facility in Casa Grande, Arizona  that the city is building for as far as teams to compete in.  </p><p>So we've got a lot of things.  We start signing players March 1st.  So  we're really excited about the events coming up.  </p><p>GLICK:  I'm excited.  More football is a good thing.  </p><p>Michael Huyghue, great to see you, and Bill Hambrecht, as well.  </p><p>Good luck guys and keep us up-to-date and come back during Super Bowl week  to give us the first dibs on those cities.  We'll analyze right here.  </p><p>All right, gentlemen, thanks.  </p><p>Let's get the very latest headlines with Jenna Lee.  Good morning, Jenna.  </p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK:  ... taking a look at politics first.  </p><p>President elect Barack Obama is working on a tax cut plan which could be  worth as much as $300 dollars.  </p><p>Mr. Obama and leading Democrats are hoping the tax cuts will entice  Republican support.  Mr. Obama was hoping to get the bill written and ready  for him to sign the day he takes office.  But many say mid to early  February is more likely timeline.  </p><p>The tax cuts, by the way, are part of an economic stimulus plan worth as  much as $775 billion dollars over the next two years.  At least that's  reportedly how much it is worth.  </p><p>And last night Mr. Obama officially landed in Washington, D.C.  His wife  and daughters made the trip on Saturday.  He said he's looking forward to  being in Washington, but not exactly looking forward to living in a hotel  for two weeks.  </p><p>His daughters start a new school this morning.  That's why they decided to  go to Washington two weeks before the inauguration.  </p><p>Well, imagine the situation.  You've got an interview for the job you want,  but if you take the interview, you are going to get fired from the job you  have.  </p><p>Boston college football coach, Jeff Jagodzinski, was just -- just led his  team to a bowl game, faces that very situation.  He's set to interview for  the head coaching job with the New York Jets, but the ESPN reports if he  does Boston College is actually going to fire him.  </p><p>Apparently, though, the coach reportedly plans to go ahead with the plans  and interview anyways.  </p><p>I guess no risk, no reward.  </p><p>You're up-to-date now the FOX Business Network.  Now it's time for  \"Charles's choice.\"  </p><p>GLICK:  Unbelievable.  Getting fired for having a conversation with the  JETS, unbelievable.  </p><p>All right.  In his Wall Street strategies hot line, Charles Payne says the  start to a new year of trading Friday was surreal as retailers,  homebuilders and tech stocks fared better than they should have and he says  more good news could be coming.  </p><p>\"The broad market or the board market has a nice wind in its sails and most  of the major equity indices are on the verge of big-time breakouts.\"  </p><p>Joining me now with more on this is -- in my bullish Mr. Charles Payne.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  So you're feeling good.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, and particularly from a short-term point of view.  You know,  it's interesting, Richard Suttmeier spoke earlier about his technical  parameters, same thing.  I'm looking at the Dow, there really is no  resistance between 9000 and 9600.  </p><p>S&amp;P is on the cusp of a major breakout as well.  So you're going to get a  lot of momentum players who've been sitting on the sidelines who feel like,  you know what, better hop on this train.  </p><p>GLICK:  But do you also agree with Richard that we could, at some point  this year, retest the lows?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  You know, I think what we're -- we're putting hope and  - anticipation.  A lot of this is rationalization.  </p><p>GLICK:  Around the inauguration, right?  </p><p>PAYNE:  It can't get worse than this.  There's going to be a lot of money,  and how long can we keep shrugging off bad news?  </p><p>You know we'll see Friday will be the first test.  If the numbers come in  more than 500,000 people lost their jobs and the market still goes up, then  I say ride this wave, but understand at some point these numbers do mean  something.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Negatively.  </p><p>GLICK:  At some point the shoe has to drop.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  Let's look at a couple of the names.  First one,  SalesForce.com.  </p><p>PAYNE:  SalesForce.com.  You can see where the stock is really beginning --  you know, you can see it has some resistance right there.  It's beginning  to turn around here.  This is a stock that I like a lot.  We've talked  about this before in the past.  I think they're going to be acquired.  </p><p>I will say, though, Alexis, it's an expensive stock, it's not cheap.  It's  trading at a six times book.  Nevertheless, technically, it breaks out at  35, from there it has room to 40.  And if they are acquired, it's been in  the rumor mill for about two years.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK, and remind us, what do they do?  </p><p>PAYNE:  They do software.  They compete with -- SAP and Oracle.  In fact  this guy who started this company used to work with Oracle and it just --  it's one of these things.  I don't know if I would consider it mission  critical but certainly, in this sort of economic environment, businesses  would buy software to try to make things work out for them as opposed to  spending money elsewhere.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  CNH Global.  Tell me about this company.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, you've heard of their products.  Case, New Holland, big  equipment, you know, a lot of agricultural stuff.  Also a lot of  construction stuff.  And you know, this whole stimulus thing that we're  talking about, same sort of thing.  </p><p>You can see where the stock is just building a base here.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, building the bottom there.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  So right in the air, once it breaks through that point, I  think it's off to the races.  But, not just stimulus in America, you know,  China, Europe, everywhere we're going to be seeing a demand for these sort  of products.  </p><p>The last two quarters they blew the cover off the ball but the quarters  before that they missed.  But this stock is so cheap down here.  I love the  risk-reward.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  We have to leave it here.  I know we're going to go into  another one but we've got a lot more stuff to cover.  </p><p>PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Charles, thank you very much.  Good tips.  </p><p>PAYNE:  You got it.  All right.  s</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Coming up we're going to go \"In the Pit.\"  We're going  to talk Madoff, more on the scheme and what, of course, will happen today  in D.C. when -- testimony begins at 2:00 p.m. today.  House Financial  Services Committee are going to talk about it.  </p><p>Also we want to welcome -- look at this.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Vegas.  Whoa.  </p><p>GLICK:  Cox Communications in Vegas.  We love Vegas.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Absolutely.  </p><p>GLICK:  We'd like to go visit you in Vegas.  All right, that's coming up  next.  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Congress will be searching for answers today in a $50 billion  scheme allegedly tied to Bernie Madoff.  Lawmakers are going to be grilling  the Securities and Exchange Commission over why it is that it took so long  to uncover the scandal.  </p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" this morning saying that the SEC examined Madoff's  investment company eight times in 16 years.  Now the SEC also reportedly  followed up on e-mails from a New York hedge fund that described madoff's  business practices as highly unusual and yet nothing was done about it  which is so incredibly frustrating.  </p><p>Then, of course, we learn now that there are all these offshore accounts as  well.  What do you make of this?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, it's -- sort of the stuff that main street has always, you  know - </p><p>GLICK:  Paranoid about.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, that the fix is in, that the big guys everyone looks the other  way even that -- even when they go in there, but this -- it's a very  complicated situation.  </p><p>I think the SEC needs to train their personnel a lot better, you know, the  thing about today's hearings, though, the guy holding it, the  representative, Paul (INAUDIBLE), I'm a little worried because he's already  made certain comments, which makes me -- for instance, he's saying this  whole thing provides a glaring example of Congress must provide reforms.  </p><p>GLICK:  Do something about regulation.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  So, you know, are we going in there to try to figure out  the answers or are we going in there with preconceived, you know,  political, and you know...</p><p>GLICK:  He's been fighting for more...</p><p>PAYNE:  ... determination.  </p><p>GLICK:  He's been fighting for mire regulatory oversights since 2000 so  this is going to give a lot of people who want more of regulatory...</p><p>PAYNE:  There's no doubt about that but the question is, is that the  problem?  I mean after all the man was investigated.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  The investigations were run poorly.  But he was investigated.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE:  And you have -- you had personal experience on that Charles.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>LEE:  You thought that the people that came to your shop had weren't really  equip to do it.  </p><p>PAYNE:  They had no clue.  We I say no clue, it was sad.  I men it's really  weird, you know?  You know as a registered investment adviser you get --  audited periodically.  So we're being audited.  They had two young kids  right out of college.  And they really had, what I said, Alexis, no clue.   It was sad.  </p><p>GLICK:  That is what the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said to us this  morning is you've to do something about the examiners, you know e young  kids coming out of college.  </p><p>They are not going to know how to look for loopholes in a $0 billion  investment firm.  Let's leave it there.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Let's leave it there.  Of course, we're going to  continue to talk about that.  Hearings will be at 2:00 p.m. today.  We'll  be covering that.  </p><p>And coming up next, we're going to talk about Obama's fiscal stimulus plan.   What does it look like?  That's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of  MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Alexis Glick.  Happy new year.  </p><p>In this hour, we're going to take a look at President-elect Obama's new  stimulus plan.  And Woolworth's will close its doors overseas.  So why does  it have a business impact here?  We're going to explain.  And the latest  installment of America's greatest business rivalries.  It's a good one.   It's about the burger wars.  It's McDonald's versus Burger King.  </p><p>But first, take a quick look at the futures here in the U.S. because this  is going to be a very busy week for economic data, in particular those  unemployment numbers due out this Friday.  Right now the Dow is down 35  points.  The S&amp;P is down 4.  Nasdaq up 3.  It's pretty much unchanged to  start the morning.</p><p>Well, let's start hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with the three  things you should know this morning.  </p><p>President-elect Barack Obama and congressional Democrats are looking to put  forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and  businesses.  This is an attempt to gain Republican support for its more  than $700 billion economic stimulus package.  We'll talk more about that in  a moment.</p><p>And French President Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with  Israeli President Shimon Perez.  The two leaders will hold a working  political meeting to discuss political and security issues in Gaza.   Sarkozy will also met with the Palestinian Authority leaders in an attempt  to push for a cease fire in the ongoing Gaza conflict.  </p><p>And the Bernard Madoff scandal goes to Washington.  The House Financial  Services Committee beginning an open session this afternoon exploring the  $50 billion Ponzi scheme.  In the hot seat will be the Securities and  Exchange Commission's inspector general after \"The Wall Street Journal\"  reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company  eight times in as many as 16 years.  </p><p>All right.  Those are the three top stories you need to know about this  morning.  Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas  market, let's go visit Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p>Good morning, Ashley.  </p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis, and good morning,  everybody.  </p><p>We've had a positive day of trading in Asia overnight on this first full  week of trading for 2009.  And here in Europe, well, we're desperately  hanging on, trying to stay positive but we're starting to sink just a  little bit.  Let's take a look at the latest numbers.  Here in London, on  the FTSE 100, we're now down about 0.2 percent.  In France, on the CAC 40,  down about 0.1.  We've been in the same range ever since the opening bell.   And the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up slightly by 0.1 percent.  So not a whole lot  of conviction right now.  </p><p>But some bad news today, or some sad news certainly.  It's been in business  since 1759 in Ireland, but no more.  Not unless a buyer can be found.   Irish company Waterford Wedgwood announcing today it is calling in  administrators for bankruptcy protection.  The Irish group best known for  Wedgwood pottery, Royal Doulton and Waterford Crystal, collapsed after  talks over a possible investment in the business failed.  </p><p>A glimmer of hope.  Take it where you can.  European investor confidence  increased for the first time in seven months in January thanks to low  interest rates and government measures to stimulate the economy.  The  latest index rising from minus 42 to minus 34.  Doesn't sound that great,  but the biggest jump in more than three years.  And we'll take it.</p><p>Now let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning.  </p><p>Good morning, Connell.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Ashley.  </p><p>Keeping an eye on a number of things today, including the U.S. automakers.   The big three from Detroit set to release their sales figures for the month  of December and the rest of 2008 today.  As you might expect, those numbers  are expected to be pretty dismal.  The American car maker selling 3 million  fewer vehicles in '08.  That's the forecast.  If that's the case, the  biggest drop since 1974, while the foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW,  this morning, speeding towards an expansion.  Their stateside market,  there's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about those expansion plans  today as we look at the GM and Ford stock prices.  </p><p>Now, number two, we want to take a look here at Walgreen for a moment.  The  drugstore chain just coming out as we speak with some same-store sales  numbers for last month, the month of December.  And it looks like stores  open at least a year saw sales increased by 4.9 percent, as we look at  Walgreen's stock price there.  And that one over -- that one-year time span  you're looking at is down about 25 percent.  And it says that some calendar  shifts had a positive impact on the month.  And the pharmacy sales,  comparable sales there, were up by 8.5 percent.  And overall sales up  almost 11 percent, 10.8.  But again, sales at stores open at least a year  up almost 5 percent at Walgreen.  </p><p>And number three is Boeing, securing a contract worth $2.1 billion with  India.  The aircraft manufacturer is going to deliver at least 8 of the P- 81 anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare airplanes in the next four  years.  Boeing's looking to -- a bid for India defense projects totaling up  to$20 billion over the course of 10 years.  </p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning, Alexis.  Back over  to you.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, Connell, thank you very much.  </p><p>Well, President-elect Obama prepared to meet with economic leaders and  economic advisors today in Washington.  \"The Wall Street Journal\" is  reporting that the future president is crafting a plan that could provide  over $300 billion in tax cuts.  Fox Business' senior Washington  correspondent Peter Barnes joins us with the very latest.  </p><p>Good morning, Peter.  </p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Alexis.  </p><p>The president-elect will start negotiating the details of a massive new  stimulus plan, which may total around $700 billion, $800 billion or so, to  save or create up to 3 million jobs.  And we can confirm now that the  president-elect will propose tax cuts of about $300 billion as part of that  plan.  That's from Democratic sources on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>Now let's take a look at the plan's major provisions as we know them this  morning.  There would be $150 billion in tax cuts and tax credits for  workers.  $100 billion or so in tax breaks for companies to create jobs and  to make new investments in plant and equipment.  </p><p>The plan would extend unemployment benefits, including to part-time workers  for the first time.  The plan would expand Medicaid to unemployed workers,  also for the first time.  And other provisions could include subsidies to  employers who continue health insurance coverage to laid off and retired  workers.  </p><p>All of this on the table today when the president-elect meets with top  Democrats and Republicans on The Hill.  The tax cut provisions, something  that Republicans have been looking for, to support a stimulus plan.  </p><p>The goal has been to try to get the work on the stimulus plan done and  approved by both the House and Senate by the time Mr. Obama is inaugurated  on January 20th, but congressional leaders warning this weekend that they  will need more time to consider the plan.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: It's going to be very  difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have  sufficient time to be reviewed and then sufficient time to be debated and  passed.  But we certainly want to see this package passed through the House  of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the  Senate and have it to the president before we break for the presidential  break.  </p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": And that's mid February? </p><p>HOYER: Early February, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: And that, Steny Hoyer speaking with our own Chris Wallace on \"Fox  News Sunday\" yesterday.  </p><p>Mr. Obama has his first meeting this morning at 11:00 with House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, Peter Barnes, thank you very much.  </p><p>Well, Mr. Obama says his proposed American recovery and reinvest plan is  crucial to not only solving the current economic problems facing America,  but challenges that may come along in the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BARACK OBAMA, (D) PRESIDENT-ELECT: We need an American recovery and  reinvest plan that not only creates jobs in the short term, but spurs  economic growth and competitiveness in the long term.  And this plan must  be designed in a new way.  We can't just fall into the old Washington habit  of throwing money at the problem.  We must make strategic investments that  will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, for more on that estimated $775 billion stimulus plan, and if  it will kick-start the economy, I'm joined by Dr. Peter Morici, an  economist with the University of Maryland, and Erin Billings, the associate  editor of the Capitol Hill newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Good morning, guys.  Great to see you.  </p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, good to see you.  Happy new year.  </p><p>DR. PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND ECONOMIST: Happy new year.</p><p>GLICK: So you hear this morning about $300 billion in tax cuts.  You're  probably falling over in your chair.  Wow, is he speaking of blue dog  Democrats and Republicans or what? </p><p>MORICI: He absolutely is speaking to blue dog Democrats and Republicans.   One problem I do see, though, is it's so complex.  I mean the investment  provisions are fairly arcane, which is going to lead to a lot of  negotiations.  And ultimately that's going to take time.  </p><p>One of the advantages of a tax cut is it bites faster.  But infrastructure  spending gives you more bang for the buck longer term.  If he wants  strategic investments, that's the place to find them.  The kinds of tax  cuts he's talk about pretty much are retreads of past stimulus packages.  </p><p>GLICK: Well, it's interesting, Erin, because, you know, there have been  those who have suggested that the lions share of this fiscal stimulus  package would be directed toward, you know, types of -- different types of  infrastructure projects and yet here he is coming out with what could be  tax cuts that far exceed those that President Bush put in twice during his  eight years as president.  I mean that's got to be a little bit of a  shocker.  </p><p>ERIN BILLINGS, \"ROLL CALL\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Well, Obama clearly is trying  to lead from the center.  And he knows he can't pass this if he doesn't  have Republicans on board.  They want tax cuts and he knows he needs them  to come on board and sign on.  So that's what we're seeing here.  </p><p>He's trying to come up with something that will appeal to the masses.   That's why he's taking the salesmanship directly to The Hill.  He's meeting  with these guys and he's saying, look, there's something in it for  everybody.  And he knows he's going to have to pass this with probably 80  votes in the Senate, and he wants a very strong majority in the House as  well.  This can't be a Democratic bill.  </p><p>GLICK: OK.  So, Peter, if we're talking about $800 billion, let's say for  the sake of argument, we know $300 billion is directed towards tax  incentives and loopholes and all those kinds of things, many of which are  for small business owners.  You tell me, when he has talked about 2.5  million, now up to 3 million either created or saved jobs, where does the  jobs component of this fiscal stimulus plan factor in?  Where are we going  to create those jobs? </p><p>MORICI: Well, if we spend money and we get people buying goods and services  again, we're going to get a multiplier effect.  If we spend $100 billion on  infrastructure, we'll get a $200 billion multiplier effect on GDP.  Bottom  line is, he has to raise GDP by about $330 billion to create 3 million new  jobs, which means he has to spend, in the first year, about $330 billion  because it takes some time to get the money out.  So look for a stimulus  package, if it's going to be consistent with this goal, of somewhere around  $350 billion spent in '09, and about $350 billion spent in 2010.  </p><p>GLICK: All right.  So, Erin, walk me through the Republican argument here,  because there are a lot of Republicans who are not to thrilled about this  concept here.  What do they not like about an $800 billion fiscal stimulus  package? </p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you just said it, $800 billion.  That's what they don't  like.  You know, the Republicans are trying to reclaim this fiscal  discipline mantle that they enjoyed for the last, you know, what, 40 years,  30 years.  They lost their way.  They're trying to find it again.  And they  need to prove to the American public that they know who they are.  And a  big part of that is maintaining that fiscal discipline.  They want to be  the check and the balance on this new administration.  So clearly that's  where it starts.  </p><p>Secondly, they want these tax provisions.  They've been pushing for that  behind the scenes.  It looks like they're probably going to get it.  </p><p>Thirdly, they want some time.  They don't want to just have this rammed  down their throats.  They don't want to look like they're rubber stamping  anything that the Obama administration is bringing to The Hill.  So they're  going to try and at least slow the process so they can have input and try  to at least get their imprint on it.  </p><p>And so I think what you'll see at the end of the day is, we will have some  kind of compromise proposal.  It's not going to be everything Obama is  laying out right now.  It's it's probably not going to get done till  February.  I mean if the Democrats are lucky, they'll get it right before  this February recess we're looking at, which begins on the 16th, I believe,  of February.  And Republicans are not going to sign on unless they get some  of their wants in there.  </p><p>GLICK: Well, and the good news is, at least a realistic expectations are  being set and we're preparing the markets by telling then.  </p><p>Peter, here's my opportunity, it's the new year, to get your assessment of  where this economy is headed.  This Friday we have probably -- arguably one  of the most important numbers.  We'll get the unemployment numbers for  December, non-farm payrolls.  Where is the economy headed? </p><p>MORICI: Well, in terms of numbers, we probably haven't seen the worst of  it.  GDP was only down a half a point in the third quarter.  Fourth quarter  GDP will probably be down 5 percent on an annualized basis.  And in the  next quarter, another 2 percent or 3 percent.  So we're likely to see job  losses continue through the first quarter.  </p><p>Also, if we get a stimulus package say by the end of February, we're not  going to get checks out to people until May 1.  And we're not going to get  any infrastructure spending till the second half of the year.  So if we're  looking for recovery in the economy, it's the second half.  </p><p>However, don't be too down on the stock market because the stock market has  factored this all in.  Economists have been saying this for quite some time  now.  And so my feeling is the stock market has bottomed out and it will  get its legs as long as the Democrat appear able to bridge the gap, reach  consensus with the Republicans, as long as they're confident that the  stimulus package is coming, businesses will see brighter prospects for the  second half of the year and the market will lead us out of the recession.   It won't be a lagging indicator, rather it will anticipate the recovery.  </p><p>GLICK: Erin, the 11th Congress goes into session tomorrow.  There's a lot  of new Democrats taking positions.  There's a perception out there that  President-elect Obama will accomplish more because he's got more Democrats  on his side.  But he's clearly made some significant gestures over the past  six weeks about what he's willing to do by walking across the aisle.  Will  they have success this year, not just for the fiscal stimulus plan, but  with accomplishing other major intended goals? </p><p>BILLINGS: Well, that's a great question.  I mean, as you know, Barack Obama  ran as a candidate of change.  He ran as a consensus candidate.  And now  he's going to try and govern as a consensus president.  That is a real  test.  It's very easy to talk the talk.  But now he's got to walk the walk.  </p><p>As you mentioned, he's been reaching out to congressional Republicans.   He's had his surrogates reach out to congressional Republicans in, you  know, in the weeks after he won the election on November 4th.  And now it  really gets down to bras tax.  </p><p>I mean the first real test is this economic stimulus.  If he can get this  through with bipartisan support, then I think that really is a harbinger of  things to come.  He's laid out a bunch of agenda items that are largely  consensus items, but the stimulus may or may not be.  So, you know, we'll  have to see.  It's going to take some time.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, time will tell.  </p><p>BILLINGS: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it's going to be very interesting because, you know, we sort of  put health care and a lot of the other top issues on the back burner, all  to talk about this stimulus program, which makes a lot of sense given the  current environment.</p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, happy new year.  As always, great seeing you.</p><p>And, Erin, stay with me because, Erin, you and I are going to talk about  one of the big topics going into this 111th Congress because the other big  story on The Hill is the man who's been tapped by (ph) Illinois Governor  Rod Blagojevich to fill Mr. Obama's vacant Senate seat.  Roland Burris will  also be on Capitol Hill this week to begin his new job.  Burris is facing  opposition because of the Blagojevich scandal to sell Mr. Obama's seat.  On  yesterday's \"Meet the Press,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who's  defended his right to block Burris' appointment, said anything could  happen.  Take a listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, \"MEET THE PRESS\": There sounds to me like there may be some  room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.  </p><p>SEN. HARRY REID, (D) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Hey, listen, David, I'm an old  trial lawyer.  There's always room to negotiate.  </p><p>GREGORY: All right.  So you're not saying no completely that he won't  serve?  That's what you're saying? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: All right.  So what Burris will encounter in Washington and what  role his financial background may play, we go back to Erin Billings.  She's  the associate editor of the Capitol newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Erin, we only have just about 60 seconds here.  What do you expect to  happen in the coming days and how will that impact his ability to be sworn  in as senator of Illinois? </p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you know, as you know, the new Congress kicks off tomorrow.   Roland Burris has said he's coming to down.  The Democratic leaders are  going to meet with him on Wednesday and I think they're going to try and  kind of talk him down.  Tell him, hey, maybe you should just back off.   Let's see what happens with Governor Blagojevich.  </p><p>As you know, the general assembly is moving to impeach him.  I think the  Democrats would ideally like to have him ousted and then the lieutenant  governor could then make the selection.  But you're right, Harry Reid left  the door just slightly ajar.  And even though his aides are now saying,  well, there's not really room for negotiation.  He may -- you know, maybe  they're reading too much into it.  Certainly Harry Reid doesn't do things  on accident.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.  No, I mean, it was interesting Harry Reid's comments there  yesterday.  He was really couching it.  But is there a chance that the  Senate will say no, you cannot take the seat? </p><p>BILLINGS: Well, I don't think there's really a lot of support to give him  the seat, even on the Republican side.  I mean the Republicans, Mitch  McConnell, the minority leader, said on Sunday on a different show that,  you know, that there should be a special election in Illinois to deal with  this.  And so everyone is looking at this cloud of corruption and no one  seems to think that this is the process by which they should appoint the  new senator from Illinois.  </p><p>So I think it would be a really heavy lift unless there was some kind of a  bipartisan deal.  Harry Reid is going to meet with McConnell this morning,  or today, to talk about the situation.  I think they're going to try and  figure out if there's a bipartisan road to go down.  But it's anybody's  guess.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, Erin Billings, thank you so much for sticking with us.   We appreciate it.</p><p>BILLINGS: Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break.  When we come  back, we'll talk more about what's going on in the Gaza Strip and what the  implications might be for Israel.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back.  </p><p>Well, the pressure is mounting on Israel to stop its 10-day offensive  against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.  But Israel says the attacks will continue  until militants stop firing rockets at its citizens.  Fox New's David Lee  Miller is live on the Gaza border this morning with the very latest.  </p><p>Good morning, David.  </p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis.  </p><p>That's right.  The defense minister, Ehud Barak, paid a visit to some of  the troops on the front lines a little earlier today and he also said  today, speaking at the Connesset (ph), that the Israeli offensive is going  to continue until there is peace and tranquility along Israel's border with  Gaza.</p><p>Today, nevertheless, at least 24 rockets have been fired.  In fact, that  was the figure up until we went on the air.  Then shortly -- I'd say less  than 30 seconds ago, another rocket was fired off in the distance headed  into Israel.  So that makes at least 25 rockets that have been fired today.   A number of them literally flew over our heads.  One reaching as far as 25  miles into Israel, into the city of Beersheva.  </p><p>Meanwhile, on the ground, Israeli forces have effectively now surrounded  Gaza City.  Gaza City and its nearly half a million residents.  There has  been a great deal of fighting on the ground.  But for the most part, the  Israeli forces are staying out of the urban areas.  They are staying on the  outskirts of Gaza City.  </p><p>Hamas, meanwhile, is trying to draw them into the more urban environments  for some type of guerrilla conflict.  The Israelis say that they are  constantly moving on the ground.  In the words of one commander, they don't  want to be sitting ducks.  They are there to find the militants.  </p><p>Now, as for the death toll, the figures provided by Palestinian medics,  they say that as many as 60 Palestinians have been killed, only six of  which they say were militants.  The remainder, they say, are civilians and  many of them are children.  These are figures that we cannot independently  confirm.  As for the Israeli casualties, one soldier has been killed since  the ground incursion got underway. And as many as 40 have been injured.  </p><p>And, lastly, there is some progress to report on the diplomatic front.   We've got the EU involved, the French president involved, the United  Nations involved.  Perhaps the best hope for some type of diplomatic  solution here now, Alexis, is a delegation that has -- I am told we've got  another strike off in the distance.  You can see the cloud of black plume  of smoke.  </p><p>Let me finish making my point as you take a look at this latest Israeli air  strike.  A delegation of Hamas has left Syria, heading towards Egypt, for a  meting tomorrow.  It is expected at this meeting the Egyptians are going to  demand that Hamas move forward with the cease fire process and stop the  rocket attacks.  What influence they're going to have, that is somewhat  questionable.  Only a short time ago, before this conflict began, Egypt  asked Hamas to stop the rocket attacks.  Hamas ignored that request.  This  time around maybe they'll see things differently with Israeli forces on the  ground, in the air, and at sea, all targeting Hamas in Gaza.  </p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: David, I imagine, you know, just watching that bomb go off behind  you there, that you're in a very dangerous area there on the border in  Gaza.  Just give us some feeling of what's going on around you as we're  kind of watching this unfold.  I imagine this is pretty scary.  </p><p>MILLER: It's a little unnerving at first.  I won't say you get used to it,  but this is the way people live along southern Israel, and they have been  living for years with these rocket attacks a regular part of their lives.   But recently, because of the increase in these rocket attacks, life had to  change.  They've stopped school.  Parties have been stopped.  Social events  had to be rescheduled.  So there has been a significant change in people's  lives here.  </p><p>But for the most part, for most Israelis, life does go on.  This is  something they have to cope with.  They just have to change their daily  habits.  But when these rockets are launched, you've got 15 to 45 seconds  to take cover.  And let me tell you -- I'm losing my voice here -- that 15  seconds can be a very, very long.  You wait 15 seconds for that rocket to  hit and you just hope it's not going to land anywhere near you.  </p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right.  David Lee Miller, be safe.  Thank you very much, from  Fox News, for joining us this morning, bringing us up to date on this  story.  </p><p>All right, guys.  Well, from what's going on in the Gaza Strip, to what's  going on with the Bernie Madoff scandal.  Coming up next, we're going to  bring you up to date on the very latest on this 2:00 p.m. committee sub  hearing about what happened here and all the ties.  It's a terrible story.  But, of course, we'll bring you up to date on that in just a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER: And welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.  I'm Ashley Webster in  London, keeping track of the overseas markets for you.</p><p>And it's generally been positive, certainly in Asia overnight.  And we  started positively enough here in Europe, although perhaps not with a lot  of conviction.  But now sentiment has turned just a little more bearish.  </p><p>Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you in London.  We've been up  about a quarter to a half a percent for most of the day so far.  But now  we've turned negative.  We're down now about a half a percent on the FTSE,  down 28 points.  Also on the CAC 40 in Paris, down half a percent. And on  the DAX 30 in Germany, also down about a third of a percent.  </p><p>There has been some speculation, of course, of a big stimulus package being  passed by the Obama administration when it comes into power.  That gave  some impetus, if you like, to the Asian trading.  But so far into Europe  haven't picked up on that sentiment quite strongly, although we have seen  the higher oil prices lift some of the sectors.  The oil sector certainly  benefitting from that.  Although now we're seeing even the oil stocks turn  slightly negative.  Royal Dutch Shell down now 3 percent.  </p><p>We're also seeing some weakness in the European auto sector, including a  couple of downgrades today for both Renault in France and Porsche.  New car  registrations in France plunged in December, down 24 percent.  All of this  spelling more tough news for the automakers.  Renault down 5 percent in  Paris.  Porsche also down now 5 percent.  </p><p>We've also seen a lot of money coming out of gold.  Gold trading in London  down $26 an ounce to right around $853.  As a result, though, we've seen  the dollar get stronger against most of the foreign currencies, including  the euro and the British pound.  The dollar coming in right now at 1.44  against the British pound.  </p><p>All right.  Back to New York now and Jenna Lee for the latest news  headlines.  </p><p>Jenna.  </p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you so much, Ashley.  </p><p>And we begin with a sad story to update you on.  We could soon find out  what killed Jett Travolta.  Today, an autopsy will be done on the 16-year- old's body.  And it is believed at this time that he had a seizure and hit  his head on the bathtub.  Of course, Jett is the son of actor John  Travolta, and as well as actress Kelly Preston.  They released a statement  saying, \"Jett was the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask  for.  We are heart broken that our time with him was so brief.\"  So, again,  we'll keep you updated as we hear more.  </p><p>In the meantime, we're just going to turn to another story coming off the  weekend.  The new year's weekend box office went to the dogs this time.   20th century Fox's \"Marley &amp; Me\" held on to the top spot, pulling in just  over $24 million.  Disney's \"Bedtime Stories\" came in second with just  $20.3 million.  It was followed by Paramount's \"The Curious Case of  Benjamin Button,\" United Artists \"Valkyrie\" and Warner Brother's \"Yes Man.\"   All those rounding out the top five.</p><p>Also, Will Smith has been voted the top money-making movie star of 2008 in  the 76th annual Quigley Poll.  The star of Columbia Pictures, \"Seven  Pounds\" is the only -- the second African-American actor after Sydney  Poitier to top t he poll.  Robert Downey Jr. came in second and Christian  Bale claimed third.  </p><p>All right.  You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network.  Coming up,  we're going to take a look at one of America's greatest business rivalries.   It's the king versus Ronald McDonald.  The battle of two multi-billion  dollar companies continues to heat up.  Stay with us.  You don't want to  miss it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>This half-hour, we're going to take a look at the rivalry between  McDonald's and Burger King, two of my favorites.  And we're going to look  at the end of the road for retail giant Woolworth.  </p><p>And Fox 50 member Federal Express is raising rates as its shipping volume  continues to slip.  Will it affect the stock?  We'll talk about that.  </p><p>Take a quick look at the futures, as we're one hour away from the market  opening right now.  </p><p>The Dow is now down 50, we're down about half a percent.  The S&amp;P, as you  can see, is down about 6 points.  It's down about .6 percent.  And the  Nasdaq is also down about half a percent.  </p><p>We're at the lows of the morning.  We'll see how that shapes up as we head  closer to the bell.  </p><p>Now it is time for this week's edition of \"America's Greatest Business  Rivals.\"  </p><p>MCSHANE:  All right, Alexis.</p><p>In this week's edition of the series here ongoing, we do heat up these  burger wars, McDonald's and Burger King.  Burger King brought in $2.5  billion in the year 2008, while McDonald's earned $6.3 billion in the third  quarter alone.  So that kind of tells you how they stack up against each  other.  Certainly a lot of hamburgers no matter how you slice it.  </p><p>And while the two of them expand their empires here in 2009 to offer items  like lattes, even burger-scented body spray, apparently, we're going to  take a look back now at where these two rivals first fired up their grills.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE (voice-over):  The Big Mac versus the Whopper.  Flame broiled  versus grilled.  McDonald's versus Burger King.  It's one of America's  hottest business rivals that, after more than 50 years, shows no slowing  down in the fast food wars.  </p><p>Burger King and McDonald's burst onto the scene during the all-American  1950s.  Burger King set up shop in 1954 and McDonald's in 1955.  Since  then, they've taken each other on pound for pound.  </p><p>Over the past 50 years, they built franchise after franchise throughout the  world.  Burger King's signature burger, the Whopper, sizzled onto its menu  in 1957.  McDonald's fired off its Big Mac in 1968.  And the crispy, salty  fries, well, they have been perfected over the years.  Customers have  flocked to these rivals, partly because of all the choices and the  convenience, but they also haven't had to empty out their pockets to eat  there.  </p><p>The country's attachment to fast food didn't go unnoticed.  By the 1990s,  Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Subway were eating into these rivals'  marketshare.  And not much later, national obesity and nutrition concerns  became prominent.  </p><p>So these days, Burger King and McDonald's have expanded into healthy foods  and even list the calories on their menus in some states and cities.   Believe it or not, Burger King now offers veggie burgers and kids' meals.   McDonald's now includes salads and chicken sandwiches.  </p><p>Whether you have a beef with the burgers or you take a bite out of them,  deciding to own a franchise might be found in the numbers.  If you owned a  Burger King franchise in 2004, your sales could have reached $1 million.   And in 2007, sales could have risen to $1.2 million.  A McDonald's  franchise in 2004 could have earned you $1.6 million in sales, and three  years later you could have brought in $1.9 million.  </p><p>Would you buys a franchise today?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE:  All right.  So, for more on these burger wars, we're going to  send it over to Alexis.  </p><p>And to do so, I'm going to be back here, Alexis, in just a moment with some  news out of Apple, because Steve Jobs has just sent a letter out, which he  says, among other things, that he's been losing weight throughout 2008, but  the reason has been a mystery to him and his doctors.  We'll look through  that and get some more details in just a moment.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  No, I'm just seeing this press release coming out from the  board of directors.  </p><p>Great point there, Connell.  We'll cover that breaking news story in just a  moment.  </p><p>But let's finish up on the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King.  I  think I'm a fairly good expert on this.  </p><p>I'm joined by Sheri Daye Scott, editor-in-chief for \"QSR\" magazine, and  Steve West, the vice president of equity research for restaurants for  Stifel Nicolaus.  </p><p>Good morning, guys.  </p><p>Sherri, let me start with you.  </p><p>Burger King and McDonald's, it's a rivalry that has been legendary.  Where  does it stand right now?  </p><p>SHERRI DAYE SCOTT, \"QSR\" MAGAZINE:  Well, you know, McDonald's is number  one.  They've been number one for a long, long time.  But Burger King has  kind of carved its own niche into the market, and they're doing well in  that niche.  </p><p>The two are playing in different markets.  McDonald's is focusing on mom  and kids, and Burger King is focusing on those young edgy guys.  And both  are number one in those markets.</p><p>GLICK:  And so I imagine, Steve, that each of the two, Burger King and  McDonald's, they've figured out how to remain competitors in a marketplace  that they feel has enough room for each of them to be the dominant players.  </p><p>STEVE WEST, STIFEL NICOLAUS:  Yes, that's exactly right.  They've both,  over the last several years, have really evolved their menus to ad, as we  mentioned before, healthier type options.  </p><p>Now, is it healthy food?  I wouldn't go that far.  But when you can go to  McDonald's and get grilled chicken sandwiches, salad, you can go to Burger  King and get -- they call them apple fries, basically sliced apples, Mac  and cheese for the kids, they are focusing on healthy items, they are  focusing on premium items.  That helps drive those sales at the franchisees  that you mentioned earlier.  So things are doing very well.  </p><p>And when we think about the consumer here in the U.S., we typically spend  almost half of our food dollars every year at restaurants.  That trend  hasn't changed that much over the last couple of years, even in these  recessionary times that we're in.  </p><p>What we're seeing is people are trading down to fast food because of the  value, because of the convenience.  It's definitely a win-win for  McDonald's and Burger King right now.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, and it's been reflected in their stock price even while this  recession, many suggest, began in the fourth quarter of last year.  </p><p>Sherri, let me turn to you, because their marketing strategies are very,  very different.  I mean, Burger King has this virgin Whopper thing going on  right now.  </p><p>How is it that they are a reflection of the company and who they are and  who they're trying to target?  </p><p>SCOTT:  Well, you know, to the point about what I mentioned earlier, the  two different marketing groups, Burger King realized McDonald's is going to  own those mom and kids, so about four or five years ago, they went after  the younger, more edgier crowd.  And Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky out in Miami  is really leading that charge.  </p><p>What they're doing is they're making people talk about Burger King.  The  Whopper, the virgin Whopper campaign, it's making people talk about their  preferences.  </p><p>Do you like the burger?  Do you like the Whopper?  Do you prefer the Big  Mac?  </p><p>Burger king has done a great job of just getting their name out into the  public, getting people to talk about Burger King, whether it's subservient  (ph) chicken campaign they did a few years ago where they had the dancing  chicken, whether it's the king in those kind of edgy and somewhat creepy  ads to people.  People are talking about Burger King in a way they probably  weren't five or six years ago.</p><p>GLICK:  So, Steve, you know, in the midst of this serious economic  downturn, each company is trying to do the right thing to differentiate  themselves in the international environment, in addition to the domestic.  </p><p>What are they trying to do to make sure that those marketshare numbers  continue to grow as not just the U.S. economy faces recession, but the  global economy faces a recession?  </p><p>WEST:  Well, they're doing really a lot of the same things.  If you look at  what McDonald's -- and I call it the McDonald's playbook, you know, when  they came out with their plan to win in 2003, really focusing on the  stores, making sure the stores looked nice, focusing on store level  execution, and getting that menu right, making it \"relevant,\" they're doing  the same thing in Europe.  </p><p>They're remodeling stores.  They shut down a lot of older, dirty looking  stores.  They're making the menu relevant.  You know, instead of just  taking a cookie cutter U.S. menu and applying it to Europe, as they used to  do, and the rest around the world, they're also making them -- they're  customizing the burgers and the chicken and the things like that with local  flare.  </p><p>GLICK:  Right.</p><p>WEST:  And that makes it relevant.  And they're also offering value.  So  they're really doing the same things around the world that they have been  in the U.S., and it's been very successful, even in these downturns that  we're seeing in Europe and Asia.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  Well, Sherri and Steve, we're going to leave it  there.  There's nothing more exciting than talking about the hamburger war  at McDonald's and Burger King.</p><p>Thank you, guys.  I'm starving now.  I'm like ready to go get some fast  food.</p><p>Thank you guys very much.</p><p>Well, we do have some breaking news surrounding the health of Apple CEO  Steve Jobs. I want to go back to Connell.  Connell has been following this  story for us.  </p><p>And Connell, I understand there is a statement coming out of the board of  directors as well.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes.  Two things here.  </p><p>One is a letter being sent out by Steve Jobs.  We talked before you started  that segment about the fact that he acknowledges the weight loss issues  that we've all seen when Steve Jobs has appeared in public within the last  year.  </p><p>He says that he has been losing weight.  And up until now, or up until  recently, that weight loss had been a mystery to him.  But now going over  some of the reasons in this letter that he has written, says the doctors  think they found the reason for it, and they expect it will take him until  late spring to regain the weight and body mass.  </p><p>Now, that reason, according to Steve Jobs and his doctors, is this -- he  says that they cite a hormone imbalance that has been, to quote from his  letter, \"... robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy.\"  So,  again, Steve Jobs saying his doctor says he has a hormone imbalance and  that is the reason he's been losing weight.  And they think that he can put  this weight back on, and he will continue as apple's CEO during his  recovery.  </p><p>He says the remedy for nutritional problems is a simple one and it's  straightforward.  And they've already begun the treatment for it.  </p><p>So on this news, it looks like the Apple stock is actually jumping up a  little bit in premarket trading.  We'll continue to follow that particular  angle of it.  </p><p>Now, you mentioned that the board of directors had put out a statement as  well.  They say, \"It's widely recognized both inside and outside of Apple  that Steve Jobs, one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the  world...\"   And they go over what they said in the past.  </p><p>They said if it ever comes to a day when Steve wants to retire, or for  other reasons can't continue as the CEO, you will know it.  That is  basically the answer that they've given us in the past.  </p><p>But again, Steve Jobs acknowledging the weight loss that he has had.  As  you see here in some of this video in which he face had looked drawn, a lot  of people had talked about that the last time he had appeared on stage.   And now saying it's because, Alexis, of a hormone imbalance and he is  taking treatment for that.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Connell, thank you very much for bringing us up to date  on that.  </p><p>We of course are going to continue to discuss it right now, because we're  going to switch gears here.  Richard Suttmeier is with me, and Charles  Payne is here with me to talk more about what the implications might be  here for Apple.  </p><p>You know, Charles, people have been saying for at least a year now that  they've got to come up with a succession plan.  Now, at least, we have some  sense as to what the illness that's affecting the man behind Apple.  But  will there be greater calls perhaps to have him do what Bill Gates did at  Microsoft, assume the chairman role and perhaps look for a future successor  in the CEO role?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Well, I think the street would like to know who the successor might  be, but I don't think anyone would like to see Steve Jobs step down if he's  capable of doing both jobs right now.  He is obviously the heart and soul  of the company.  That's why he's so important.  </p><p>You don't talk about any other individual in the company there or  associated with in this market more than Steve Jobs and Apple.  So this is  good news.  The stock obviously indicating a little bit higher.  </p><p>There's still going to be some rumblings, though.  A lot of folks are  saying, listen, you know, he suffered from pancreatic cancer.  That is  typically a pretty deadly disease.  And until this is totally resolved, we  see him put on weight, people are going to speculate.</p><p>GLICK:  Richard?  </p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM:  Well, I'm going to take it from the  standpoint of what Value Engine describes Apple computer.  It seems like  when it gets to an $85 handle, it becomes a buy-rated stock.  When it gets  into the $90s, it becomes a hold-rated stock.  </p><p>So this morning, from a trading perspective, I'm going to see how many  times this year I can make that same five to seven points.  So my  subscribers...</p><p>GLICK:  So it's range bound though.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  It's range bound.  And so I'm going to use this strength to,  say, book profits on a buy-rated stock that's now a hold.</p><p>PAYNE:  That's right, because our subscribers are in the stock, too, on an  average of about 86 bucks.  And I'm going to grapple with that as well  because, technically, it doesn't have a lot of resistance between here and  R100, but it comes down fairly quickly when it stops moving.</p><p>GLICK:  How much, guys -- I don't want to say is the bloom off the rose?   Because this is considered the darling in the tech world.  But in terms of  new innovation and new products?  Or is that just because, as my husband  said to me yesterday, we have Mac computers all over our house and you just  don't need to upgrade them as often because the fact of the matter is,  they're built terrific, they do the right things, and so you don't have to  upgrade them very often?</p><p>PAYNE:  Well, it's interesting you brought up Mac computers, because  everyone has talked about the halo effect from iPhones and iPods, and how  that would introduce audiences to the Mac computer.  People are looking at  this MacWorld Conference for something on the Mac PC.  That's what they  want to see, because they're doing exceptionally well in all other areas in  the business.  </p><p>We should also remind the audience, a pretty upbeat article in Barron's  over the weekend on Apple.  And this morning, (INAUDIBLE) Brothers also had  positive comments on them.  So the street and analysts liking what they're  seeing.</p><p>GLICK:  But Jobs isn't, as I -- right?  He's not doing the presentation, or  whatever, right?  </p><p>PAYNE:  He's not.  He's not going to be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK:  And that's the first time.  So some are going to suspect that if he  is not doing it, it's because either they're not excited about it or  perhaps that's why they put this release out today, is because he's now  being treated.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Well, I would agree with that.  He's being treated, and  hopefully the man gets well again and comes back out in six months with the  weight back on and announces another nano-nano, small-small device.</p><p>PAYNE:  But by the same token, you do at some point want other people in  the company to be associated with good news.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.</p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Yes.</p><p>PAYNE:  So hopefully whoever does make the presentation will say, \"Hey,  look at this.\"  And everyone will say, \"Wow!\" so that we're excited about  hearing from other folks.  You know, any corporation, though, if the CEO is  scheduled to speak and doesn't speak, the stock is going to get  slaughtered.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  I mean, that's the thing that concerns me here, is that, you  know, we've talked about this with the Warren Buffett situation as well,  when you desire as a shareholder some kind of succession plan.  </p><p>It doesn't mean it has to be put in place.  I mean, look, Wal-Mart decided  to do it at a time that some suggest, wow, why would you do it now?  But at  least something.  And I guess maybe we can read into who they select to do  the presentation.  </p><p>SUTTMEIER:  I mean, now it's \"Wow, but I can't afford it\" from the consumer  standpoint.  Let's see if I get my tax return.  I get a tax refund, maybe a  \"wow\" product, I'll spend it on that.</p><p>GLICK:  Except that they made this great deal with Wal-Mart, right, where  they're selling their devices.  So that's -- you know, everybody seems to  be moving in that direction.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  Everyone was pretty excited about it.  They seem to be doing  -- firing on all cylinders right now outside of the health issue with Steve  Jobs.</p><p>SUTTMEIER:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, guys.  We're going to leave it there.</p><p>Richard and Charles, thank you, guys, very much.  </p><p>Let's go to Ashley Webster in London and get a check and update on what is  going on in the overseas markets.  And he's also going to bring us up to  date on what is happening with Woolworths.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  Thank you, Alexis.  That's the big story.  </p><p>Tomorrow, the 600 remaining Woolworth stores will close in the United  Kingdom, bringing to a close an era of retail discounting.  Really, they  really were the original Wal-Marts, as one much my guests just referred to  it.  We'll get to that in a minute.  </p><p>Now, the U.S. stores that, of course, become synonymous with American  retail, the Woolworth stores in the United States even played a role in the  civil rights movement.  They began closing their doors though in the U.S.  some 29 years ago, converting in many cases to a new store, the Foot  Locker.  We'll explain how that happened as well.  </p><p>So for more on Woolworths' international legacy, I am joined by Sam Poser,  who is vice president and senior researcher analyst for Sterne, Agee &amp;  Leach.  And also joining me here in studio, Allyson Stewart-Allen, who is  director of International Marketing Partners.  </p><p>And Allyson, I'll begin with you.  </p><p>This really is the end of an era, isn't it?  But you would have thought  that someone like Woolworths were better prepared to handle an economic  downturn than many other stores.  </p><p>ALLYSON STEWART-ALLEN, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PARTNERS:  Yes,  you would have thought so.  And the thing that's fairly emotional for a lot  of British people about the closure of Woolworths here is the fact that  it's a store format that was quite innovative in its time.  </p><p>You know, the five and dime was something that in the U.K. was beforehand  not known.  You know, this time, with the Woolworths, you can go in, you  can choose what you want, it's very discount-oriented and invented the  discount category of retailing in the U.K.  So oddly enough, the fact that  it invented this category here, and now this innovator is no longer...</p><p>WEBSTER:  So what went wrong?  That's the question.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN:  Well, that's a really good point.  What usually goes wrong  with retailers of al kinds, and in particular Woolworths, is the fact that  they didn't really keep up with who their customer was.  </p><p>So they changed their categories, they didn't merchandise very well.  They  didn't have the depth of ranges that their customers expected.  </p><p>The in-store experience became increasingly bleak as all of those around  them upgraded their offerings.  So they didn't keep up with the trends,  they didn't keep up with the in-store environment.  They didn't keep up  with the merchandise.  And all of that is a recipe for total disaster.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Sam, let's go to you.</p><p>Woolworth closed its stores in the 1980s and '90s, closing the door on the  final stores in 1997.  So it's been some 11 years in the U.S. </p><p>How did this brand evolve into Foot Locker?  How did that come about?  </p><p>SAM POSER, VICE PRESIDENT, STERNE, AGEE &amp; LEACH:  Well, the last Woolworth  store closed -- Woolworth divested to Europe in 1982, and the last  Woolworth store closed in 1997.  It was just the evolution of the business  at the Woolworth Corporation, now Foot Locker Corporation, into an athletic  specialty business.  </p><p>And as that business became the dominant factor overall, Foot Locker spun  off the various businesses that didn't work quite as well for them.  And  now it's evolved into the world's largest athletic specialty retail chain.   </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  And Sam, given the current economy, how is Foot Locker  performing?  </p><p>POSER:  Well, Foot Locker's sales have been sort of stagnant over the last  few years, but they've begun to manage their businesses significantly  better than they have in the past.  The stock to sales ratio, inventory  levels and so on, have improved dramatically this year.  Basically, the  best ratio in about five years.  </p><p>We expect earnings to -- we're not looking for much earnings growth in the  next year or so, but we do see -- due to reduced top line.  However, we do  see the efficiencies improving dramatically and then beginning to take more  share.  They faced some problems recently because the athletic footwear  trend has been soft, but that's improving now.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  Well, Sam and Allyson, I just want to ask you, very  quickly, five seconds, what kind of legacy does Woolworths leave behind?  </p><p>STEWART-ALLEN:  Interestingly, the granddaughter of Mr. Woolworth, Barbara  Hutton, had a house built in Regents Park called Winfield House.</p><p>WEBSTER:  Right.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN:  And that is now the home of the American ambassador.  So  you can close the high street stores, but they're still here in another  form.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  The legacy lives on.  </p><p>STEWART-ALLEN:  It does.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.</p><p>Sam Poser, thank you very much for joining us.  </p><p>Allyson Stewart-Allen -- I want to call you Allyson Stewart-Allyson.  I  just like the word Allyson.</p><p>Thank you very much, anyway, for being here.  </p><p>STEWART-ALLEN:  Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER:  All right.  When we come back, \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"   So don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>We get started with Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p>Ashley, what do you have for us?  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Well, let me tell you, Alexis.  Today is somewhat of a sad and  interesting day.  And I'll tell you why.</p><p>It's the number one day for divorces to be filed.  In fact, this is the  busiest week of the year, and this is the busiest day of the busiest week.   And you know why?  Because the stress of the holidays is the final straw  that broke the camel's back, and today is divorce day.  So it's not very  encouraging, but somewhat interesting.</p><p>GLICK:  That is very sad.  How do you know that, Ashley?  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Yes.  I know.  Sorry.</p><p>GLICK:  That's not good.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  Sorry.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE:  It's sad, but I'm impressed how fast it happens.  You know what?   \"What did you buy?  Oh, no!\"</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  \"How much money did you spend?  You're out!\"  </p><p>All right, Jenna, what is your one thing?  </p><p>LEE:  Well, the one thing is this Apple story.  I think this is the biggest  story of the day.  We had the stimulus plan, you had the auto sales, but  really how investors take in what is going on with Steve Jobs, I think  that's going to be the most interesting story to watch today, for sure.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  And his letter to shareholders was very passionate, very  forthright.  We're going to do more of that letter coming up on \"THE  OPENING BELL,\" but we'll show you it.  But it was pretty incredible.</p><p>PAYNE:  It is.  And, you know, he's just one of these incredible guys whose  story everyone knows, and a Horatio Alger-type story.  </p><p>But I think, also, this stimulus thing with President-elect Obama, the  notion of making tax cuts such an important part of this, just may be a  very brilliant move.  Gold has gone down a lot, the dollar is beginning to  rally.  I think international markets like the news, and I think a lot of  conservative investors in America like the news as well.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  It's going to change the ballgame.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.</p><p>GLICK:  I think it is.</p><p>PAYNE:  You know, he's taken bits from all -- he's taken bits from FDR,  Eisenhower and Reagan.  And...</p><p>GLICK:  I can't wait to see this report that you're writing.</p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  It's coming out great.  It's coming out great.  A lot of work  though.  I always bite off more than I can chew.</p><p>GLICK:  I'm so excited.  We're going to dedicate a lot of time to that,  because he's writing this really in-depth report about the first 100 days  for each of those presidents.</p><p>PAYNE:  Right.  And those are the three guys, I think, three presidents  that I think are going to be very important, their game plans and how  successful they were.</p><p>GLICK:  All right.  I look forward to it.  </p><p>All right, guys.  Well, before we go, we want to welcome San Diego, Cox  Communications in San Diego.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>PAYNE:  Whoa -- San Diego, too?  So we've got Connecticut, San Diego and  Vegas.</p><p>GLICK:  We've got -- yes, right?  We've got Vegas, we have San Diego, and  we have Hartford, Connecticut.  </p><p>Welcome, guys.  We're so excited to have you guys.  </p><p>All right.  Stay with us.  \"THE OPENING BELL\" is coming up next.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

Back in the seat and ready to go.</p><p>Well, we're going to get the latest on <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson's </nameText></person>stepping away from his job as Secretary of Commerce in just a moment.</p><p>And the Madoff hearings begin today. The House Financial Services Committee will probe how it is that the SEC missed the scheme. We're going to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p>And what will 2009 look like for trading? We get hopefully off to a good start; at least so far. We'll continue to see whether or not that will work through.</p><p>And why would anyone want to start a new football league in this economy? We're going to find out.</p><p>But first take a quick look at the U.S. futures this morning as right now we're down 16 points; 8,942. The S&amp;P right now down 1.60. The NASDAQ down 2.75, but we had climbed above that 9,000 mark just late last week which we hadn't been to since early November, we'll see whether or not it shapes up to be a good year.</p><p>Well, let's get things started this morning with the three things you should know.</p><p>President-elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and Congressional Democrats meeting today are looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and businesses. This is an attempt to gain Republican support for his more than $700 billion economic stimulus package.</p><p>And French President, Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with Israeli and Palestinian authority leaders. Now, the president is there in an attempt to push for a cease-fire in of course, the war-torn Gaza area.</p><p>On the ground this morning Israel struck at new Hamas targets in Gaza as it tries to rein in rocket attacks by the terrorist group.</p><p>And Microsoft's dominance on the Internet, well it may be waning. The software giant saw the share of its Internet browser Explorer drop from 74 down to 68 percent last month. Making the biggest inroads -- Mozilla Firefox which landed 21 percent of the market share.</p><p>All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p>Now, for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets, we go to Ashley Webster in London. Good morning Ashley and happy New Year.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: And happy New Year to you too Alexis, and welcome back. Good morning everybody.</p><p>We're off to a positive start and certainly in Asia overnight and so far in Europe we are also moving higher although not exactly setting the world on fire, but we are higher, and that's good.</p><p>London Exchange, the FTSE 100 up about a quarter of a percent, just a little more than eight percent. On the CAC-40 in Paris also higher by about a tenth of a percent. And on the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up about a third of a percent.</p><p>Another iconic company falling victim to the credit crunch we find out this morning Waterford Wedgewood, now this is a company announcing today that it's calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection. The Irish group best known for Wedgewood Pottery, Royal Dalton and Waterford Crystal collapsed after talks over possible investment in this business failed. It has officially called in the administrators.</p><p>Meantime European automakers say they are taking aim at Detroit they've said this before and failed. Will it work this time? Well, Volkswagen and BMW of Germany are gearing up to expand market share in the U.S. in the next few years. VW, investing in, in its first U.S. factory in two decades and expects to triple U.S. sales to one million vehicles by 2018; BMW meanwhile, introducing a new small car and expanding its distribution network. We'll see how this works out.</p><p>Now, let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, Ashley and thanks a lot.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on these U.S. automakers today; certainly the big three from Detroit releasing their sales figures for December and the rest of 2008 later on today. And the numbers are expected to be pretty dismal with American carmakers selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08; if that's the case it would be the biggest drop since 1974.</p><p>When it comes to our foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW are actually speeding towards an expansion in their stateside market according to a report in \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning. So that's an interesting kind of twist in things.</p><p>And this week also kicks off two pretty big tech shows. Apple is set to unveil some new products today and tomorrow when Mac World kicks off in San Francisco. Investors will be looking into new gadgets as well as any kind of insight at all into the health of the CEO, Steve Jobs, who has just become an issue of late. Jobs not expected to attend the MAC World this year.</p><p>And on Wednesday night it should be pointed out the Consumer Electronic Show begins out of Las Vegas. I'll be there to cover the latest new products later on in the week from CES.</p><p>Now, Pfizer is another one we're watching today, it's weighing a merger deal with a rival drug company or it would weigh one. The Financial Times reporting the CEO Jeff Kindler says the world's largest pharmaceutical company is quote, \"open to opportunities and constantly looking at those which are big, small and in between.\" Pfizer's stock price, well, we have it is up behind you there 18.27 a share at the close; it's down almost 20 percent over that one year time span.</p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning. Alexis, back over to you Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right Connell, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, New Mexico<person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson </nameText></person>will not be joining the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>as Commerce Secretary. Richardson pulled out yesterday citing an ongoing federal investigation into a state contract awarded to one of his political donors.</p><p>With more on this story we're joined by Michael Coleman the Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief for the \"Albuquerque Journal\" which has been covering the investigation for some time and Joe Monahan a New Mexico political veteran, who now writes a blog about state politics.</p><p>Michael let me start with you. Your newspaper reported on the investigation back in August. Apparently it has been on the docket now for many months.</p><p>What type of relationship is it that <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson </nameText></person>has with this financial company known as CDR Financial?</p><p>MICHAEL COLEMAN, ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL D.C. BUREAU CHIEF: Well, their owner David Rubin had contributed about $100,000 to a couple of Governor Richardson's political action committees. And right around the same time that these donations were made the New Mexico Finance Authority, which is a quasi governmental agency with board members appointed by Governor Richardson, awarded this company a couple of contracts to help with some really complicated financial transactions, bond sales, bond swaps, et cetera.</p><p>One of those contracts was a no bid contract. And another one of those contracts CDR had issued -- had submitted the RFP but they weren't the top bidder, they weren't the top scored bidder on that but they still got the job.</p><p>GLICK: So in other words, as I understand it, they were the second in line of the bidders for the contracts so their suggestion here is this a pay for play scandal. On the other hand, <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson's </nameText></person>team says, we did absolutely everything right. In fact, the contract that we did with CDR Financial worked out to have some really important profitability for the state of New Mexico.</p><p>Tell me about that.</p><p>COLEMAN: Right. Now, they are very adamant about the fact that CDR saved the state a significant amount of money. And these bond swaps, these complicated transactions that CDR specializes in was not part of the original request for proposal.</p><p>But apparently New Mexico Finance Authority gave them points for that nevertheless. And it turns out they did one of those swaps. The only bond swap in New Mexico history apparently. And Governor Richardson and his team do say that that saved the state a lot of money.</p><p>GLICK: Joe, walk me through the normal type situation here because as I understand it, that there is a process for bidding out contracts like this, but this one appears as though it was done sort of quietly.</p><p>Tell me why that adds even more speculation to the story.</p><p>JOE MONAHAN, NEW MEXICO POLITICAL BLOGGER (ON THE PHONE): Well, there's really no reason that we know why that the paperwork is not on file with the state for this contract. I know Michael's newspaper has reported on that. And that's one of the aspects of the investigation, just how this deal was transpired.</p><p>The governor has run into problems down here before with contracts and campaign contributions. He's had to return campaign contributions several times after the press has reported that the campaign contributor was given a state contract.</p><p>So this pay-to-play situation has haunted Richardson somewhat, but not to the scale that it has now because it obviously is a national story.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Michael the $64,000 question that everybody is waking up with this morning is they are wondering how it is if you have been investigating this in your newspaper now, dating back to August, how it is that the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>didn't know that this could be an issue in terms of his ability to take over this cabinet seat.</p><p>I mean what's the back end story here?</p><p>COLEMAN: Yes, that is the $64,000 question today. I think as you said, we had reported this back in August. I talked to members of the Senate Commerce Committee in December and did a story. And they said they were aware of this.</p><p>You know, my hunch is that maybe they weren't aware of the extent to which the FBI was looking into this. I'm not sure exactly how the conversations went between Governor Richardson's and Obama's transition team. There was some indications yesterday and some reports that maybe Governor Richardson wasn't as forthcoming as they would have liked.</p><p>Richardson spokesperson denied that to us yesterday and said he was were very forthcoming. So maybe some of this will play out in the next 24 to 48 hours. We'll see.</p><p>GLICK: Joe, how does this play in New Mexico, I understand he has some of the greatest ratings -- favorability ratings as a governor there. And could, if this investigation is put behind him, could he actually wind up in another cabinet seat at one point?</p><p>MONAHAN: Well, I think this has really hurt Richardson with Obama. He's not going to be hurt much in New Mexico. He is a well liked governor. He was re-elected with a record amount of vote. But Richardson has taken a major hit nationally on this. The cabinet positions are going to be filled.</p><p>Also Ken Salazar is now the Department Interior Secretary designate; that is an important Hispanic appointment that Obama has made so it puts less heat on the administration when it comes to the ethnic aspect of this.</p><p>GLICK: All right, well, Michael and Joe, we'll leave it at that. Of course, we'll continue to follow this story. Thank you gentlemen, very much.</p><p>COLEMAN: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: Well, the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session this afternoon. They're exploring Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission's Inspector General could get a cool reception after \"Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years.</p><p>Here for a preview of the House session, we're joined by Scott Garrett, he's the Republican Representative of New Jersey who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and Harvey Pitt, former SEC Chairman and Kalorama Partners CEO.</p><p>Gentlemen, good to see you.</p><p>Harvey, let me start with you. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting as we just talked about the number of investigations over the past eight years; pretty staggering statistics. What does this say about their failure to do the job?</p><p>HARVEY PITT, FORMER SEC CHAIRMAN: Well, I think it reflects something we've all thought might have occurred here, and that is the potential for human failure.</p><p>There appears to have been a fair amount of warning to the SEC, and it appears that when people looked into these issues, they came away without concluding that anything wrong was going on.</p><p>I do think it's important to remember that this was a deliberate fraud, and that Madoff was keeping a couple of sets of books.</p><p>GLICK: So all right let me come back to that in just a second, Harvey.</p><p>Congressman Garrett, let me go to you, because I understand one of your colleagues is running this, Congressman Kanjorski. And the real story here is he wants to figure out how did this situation occur in the first place? Was this a lack of proper oversight, and what kind of regulatory reform might it lead to?</p><p>Do you worry that it's going to lead to even more regulatory oversight than we already have?</p><p>REP. SCOTT GARRETT, (R) NEW JERSEY: Oh, we always have to worry about that whenever the government is involved, there's always -- what is the term -- a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis. A crisis as it were; obviously this is a problem whether you are a large investor or middle-sized investor, a private investor or small investor; a lot of people were significantly hurt in this situation.</p><p>Now, to his credit, the Congressman Kanjorski made the comment I think earlier this morning that there obviously is responsibility also on the part of the investor in this situation.</p><p>That each investor has to make, you know, their own due diligence, if you will, when they make their investments. So you have to look at both sides of the equation.</p><p>But back to your initial question, we have to be concerned whether government comes back with a knee-jerk reaction with saying we're going to give more authority, more power, more money into the very same agency that was responsible and failed on the job.</p><p>GLICK: So Congressman, as I understand it, the SEC's Chief, you know, chief risk officer, their inspector is going to appear today in front of Congress.</p><p>GARRETT: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: The number one whistle-blower though in this was originally scheduled to appear and is now not appearing. What do you hope to get out of it, and why the change in the lineup?</p><p>GARRETT: I can't give you an answer on the change in the lineup. Obviously there are questions that we would like to have put there, say, what did you know before and why hasn't the information come forth through all the investigations that the SEC has made?</p><p>The other aspect of this as well as far as the outcome of the equation, we'll have all these investigations. We'll get all the information we possibly can, but at the bottom line, where the government is not like the private sector. The private sector is such that if this occurred in the private sector, where business failed to do what they were responsible for doing, whether it's manufacturing something, or making something or turning a profit, that business at the end of the day would be out of business.</p><p>But when government is involved, the normal reaction to it is to do just the opposite. Throw more money, put more regulation on in place, and we saw that with the Enron situation and Sarbanes-Oxley. We came back with so much more regulation in place, that it actually was a detriment to business going forward --</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>GARRETT: -- as opposed to a benefit to them.</p><p>GLICK: Harvey, let me go back to you because one of the things you touched on as you answered my first question is the fact of the matter is we now understand there have been offshore accounts. There may be many offshore accounts.</p><p>What would the SEC know or not know in that situation? I mean, you know, look, people are going to think this is egregious in how the SEC missed this but are you telling me that because there might have been offshore accounts, there could have been loopholes or opportunities for the SEC to miss it?</p><p>PITT: Well, the SEC has had a lot of experience in dealing with offshore accounts. Obviously there's bank secrecy and problems with getting all that information, but the critical function here was to go in and examine Madoff's operations, his books and records.</p><p>And I believe picking up on something the Congressman said, that it's physically impossible for any agency of government to do what we are expecting them to do. That doesn't excuse this particular situation.</p><p>But there are 11,000 registered investment advisors, and the SEC has 3,700 people on its staff. There's no way the SEC can continuously review these people. And so what's required is a whole new paradigm for dealing with inspection and examinations, and it has to be done quickly.</p><p>GLICK: You know, I don't know if you got a chance, Harvey, to see an article in the New York Times, the Sunday New York Times yesterday, an opinion article written about what needs to change at the SEC. But one of the key things that is talked about in this article is whether or not there's just too close a relationship between Wall Street and the role of the top risk officer, top inspectors at the SEC who exchange jobs between becoming a chief risk officer at the Wall Street firm and the SEC.</p><p>How do we make sure that we learn some valuable lessons here and that we don't allow something like this which involved this many investigations to go unnoticed?</p><p>PITT: Well, I think what you have to do is change the entire structure of examinations. That's what's the problem. You can't take some kids right out of college who are being paid $50,000 or $60,000 a year and ask them to examine $50 billion hedge funds.</p><p>What you need to do is have a completely different system, one that we proposed back in 2003 but which hasn't yet been adopted, and I think would solve a lot of this problem.</p><p>The SEC has to do a much better job of setting the standards and requiring independent examinations with reports both to the firm reviewed and the SEC, and then the SEC's personnel can go in and look at the issues that have been uncovered.</p><p>I think otherwise we're going to be just setting the SEC up for failure --</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>PITT: -- on a continuing basis.</p><p>GLICK: All right gentlemen, we're going to leave it there. I know this is going to a hot topic, Congressman Garrett, Harvey Pitt, as always great pleasure seeing the two of you.</p><p>All right guys, coming up we're going to go live to the Gaza Strip with the latest on Israel's ground assault and escalating tensions in the Gaza area.</p><p>And this latest Mideast conflict has oil experts worried. We're going to tell you why in just a couple moments. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back.</p><p>Well the fighting in Gaza continues. Israeli troops on the ground pushing deeper into the region. Dominic Waghorn of Sky News is live at the Gaza- Israeli border with the very latest. Dominic, good morning. Bring us to up-to-date on the very latest.</p><p>DOMIC WAGHORN, SKY NEWS: well, the fighting is continuing in Gaza. The ground force operation continues on three fronts. The Israelis have been fighting with Hamas in the south. They are targeting the smuggling tunnels there that Hamas have used to smuggle in weapons from Egypt. They have been hit with aerial bombardments and the Israeli forces are now on the ground fighting Hamas there. An armored column, a big armored column of somewhere between 100 and 150 tanks -- and armored personnel carriers has pushed right the way through the sea and is occupying land that effectively splits Gaza in two.</p><p>That means Gaza city which you will be able to see behind me if it wasn't for the haze is now encircled by Israeli forces. The fiercest fighting though, I think, has been in the area behind me. That's the north most bit of Gaza around the refugee camp of Jibalia (ph) and the town of Bethleher (ph). The reports are very close to fighting, house to house combat. According to one reports, hand-to-hand fighting in tunnels underneath those houses where an Israeli soldier was nearly abducted but was able to escape. There's no letup in the pace of this action.</p><p>GLICK: Dominic, talk to me about the humanitarian costs of all of this. I know the French president Nicolas Sarkozy is supposed to travel there today. What are the implications here?</p><p>WAGHORN: yeah, the Americans have stood full square behind the Israelis on this not critical of it but the British governments and the French have been critical of this ground invasion. And the main reason for that and the mounting concern is this humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian death toll.</p><p>Around 500, over 500 people have been killed by this in Gaza. And we don't know how many of them are civilians, but we think at least a quarter of them, many of them women and children. There were reports today of three children being killed in a house, for instance, near that armored column with one tank shell. Another artillery shell wiped out a family of seven to the north of Gaza city.</p><p>The death toll yesterday was 40 and halfway through the day we're heading towards that number again today. The Israelis though say they have no alternative but to carry out this operation. What they are not saying is how much longer it will go on for.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Dominic, we will leave it there. Thank you very much for bringing us up-to-date on the very latest. Of course be safe. Now let's send it over to Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well as the ten day assault escalates the price of oil continues to tick upwards; right now crude trading around $46. It had approached $47 earlier as some Islamic countries say that oil should be used as a weapon.</p><p>With a closer look at how the conflict is affecting oil, I'm joined by Phil Flynn, Fox Business contributor, vice president and senior market analyst for financial firm Alaron Trading.</p><p>Phil, the first question, Israeli troops are now on the ground in Gaza. Can we expect this to continue to move the price of crude oil higher?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING: Not necessarily to be honest with you. I think this is an emotional reaction to the market. I don't think anybody really believes that OPEC or other oil-producing countries are going to use oil as a weapon in this situation. But there is no doubt that psychologically on light volume it did drive this market higher. I don't think it's sustainable.</p><p>PAYNE: Having said that, do you think that -- looks like earlier today we saw $47, it is pulling back a little bit, is there a ceiling right now that oil can go to? I mean it's made a huge move off of $33.</p><p>FLYNN: It really has. We're talking in three days on light volume. And really what started this move was the news out of Russia and the Ukraine. So this is really I don't think geopolitical driven at all. I think it's more optimism about the new year.</p><p>Really what drove the market was this incredible start to the year that we had with the stock market turning around, so I think we're seeing a mood change in the market somewhat. For oil to technically confirm that this is a reversal will have to close above $50 a barrel, but I think that's going to be a tough job today unless the stock market performs magnificently.</p><p>PAYNE: Phil, we have talked about these geopolitical events.</p><p>Let's talk about the stimulus package here. What impact is the Obama stimulus plan having on oil and what will it do for oil as the year goes on?</p><p>FLYNN: I think in the short-term it's creating little bit of optimism, and if you get optimism, that can turn the market around a little bit. And it's amazing how quickly it's changed. I mean, if you look back at just, you know, New Year's Eve, oil prices were at $33. It was doom and gloom. All of a sudden, boom, we're starting to feel optimistic again and that, in and of itself, can turn oil around.</p><p>PAYNE: All right. Well thanks a lot Phil. Really appreciate your time this morning.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, we're about almost two hours away from the first full trading week of the new year getting underway. We will see if the Dow's rally on Friday can continue; 258 points, that was a big one. Looking for an encore.</p><p>More \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" when we return.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER: Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I'm Ashley Webster in London keeping an eye on overseas trading on this the first full week of trading in 2009.</p><p>So far so good; we've seen generally a positive day of trading in Asia overnight. And so far in Europe we're in the green, although not with a lot of conviction, it has to be said. We're up about 7 points on the FTSE 100. Essentially flat now in Paris on the cac-40. Up about a quarter percent in Germany on the Dax 30.</p><p>News today of another iconic business that's fallen victim to the credit crunch. Waterford Wedgewood announced today that it is calling in the administrators for bankruptcy protection. The group best known for Wedgewood pottery and Royal Dalton of Waterford Crystal collapsing after talks over a possible investment in the business failed. This Irish business dates back to 1759 -- a sad day.</p><p>Meantime, in the oil business, Saudi Arabia may well be laying the groundwork for a sizable reduction in crude oil shipments. Many members of OPEC just seem reluctant to commit to the group's pledge to cut output. So Saudi Arabia likely to take the lead in acting to shore up sagging oil prices.</p><p>Crude prices by the way are higher today. That is giving a boost to the oil stocks, but even here we're being a little mixed. BP up one and a half percent in London, but Royal Dutch shell down two percent.</p><p>We've also seen money coming out of gold, down 17 percent in London -- $17 that is per ounce in London trading.</p><p>Mining stocks doing okay but turning rather mixed as well. Rio Tinto up one and a third percent. Xstrata, another big mining company up three and a half percent. But you know what, the U.S. dollar, stronger this morning; up against both the euro and the British pound that means the pound now at $1.45.</p><p>That's the very latest from European trading. Now let's go back to New York for the latest headlines with Jenna Lee -- Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much, Ashley. Good morning once again everyone.</p><p>It could be a showdown on Capitol Hill. Roland Burris is headed to Washington today and plans to be sworn in as the junior senator from Illinois along with the rest of the new senators which happens tomorrow. But Democratic leaders have said they won't allow Burris on the senate floor.</p><p>He was appointed of course by tainted Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich who is accused of trying to sell the seat; the seat that he is supposed to take over to the highest bidder. Burris says his appointment is perfectly legal and denying him entry to the senate would be denying the people of Illinois their rightful representation.</p><p>We will have much more on Burris's controversial appointment on the next hour of \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" by the way.</p><p>Continuing with policies now, Democratic Al Franken is also hoping to be sworn in as a new senator tomorrow. Minnesota state canvassing board is expected to declare Franken the winner of one of the closest, most hotly contested and longest senate races ever.</p><p>Franken has beaten incumbent Republican Norm Coleman by 225 points. That's out of nearly 3 million votes cast. But Coleman has a number of possible legal challenges left, including contesting the entire recount. Because of that, it's unlikely that Franken, of course the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star, will be sworn in with the rest of the new senators tomorrow, but we shall see.</p><p>Some people are trying to cash in on the <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff </nameText></person>scandal, EBay is full of items featuring the Madoff's securities logo. There's this fleece jacket which the seller says is a piece of history; top bid right now, $510 for that. Check out this hat from the Madoff securities golf tournament from 2003, right now it's going for $217.50.</p><p>A steal, a bargain?

We welcome you Hartford.</p><p>We're going to take a look at how the economy is impacting the insurance industry when \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>In this half hour we're going to take a look at how the insurance industry is faring in this economy. We're going to take a look at a new football league -- I know it's hard to believe -- and how they plan to compete with the NFL. And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill today. Much more on what could happen in that hearing later at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Well, the first full week of trading in the new year gets under way in less than 90 minutes. And investors are hoping Friday's 250-point gain is just the beginning.</p><p>Let's see how things are shaping up this morning. Take a look at the futures. As you can see right now, the Dow is down 6 points. The S&amp;P is pretty much unchanged. NASDAQ right now is up just a couple points. It's actually two hours before things get started.</p><p>I said 90 minutes, but you know I'm getting excited.</p><p>So what will 2009 mean to Wall Street?</p><p>Richard Suttmeier is the founder of the stock valuation Web site ValueEngine.com and Charles Payne, WStreet.com founder and FOX Business contributor.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Happy new year. It's good to see you, guys. We're back with another year.</p><p>All right. So Charles, there is so much to talk about. It's hard to know where to begin. But I guess the most important thing for people at home right now is, is this a good place to dip your toe in the water?</p><p>I mean do we start 2009 thinking I want to be an investor?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know what? I think -- I start 2009 thinking I want to be a trader. You know, whether or not you dip your toe in for the long -- listen, here are two thing. If you're really the type of person that's going to consistently put money into the market, fine, don't stop doing that because you'll eventually -- you will be buying at the bottom.</p><p>If you're that person who's been sitting on about 40 grand, waiting for the right moment, if you're willing to be nimble, then this is the time. If this -- if you think this is the time to buy and hold, you may have a better opportunity down the road.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, nimble. Now my man Richard over here is hyperventilating.</p><p>PAYNE: I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: He's like -- he's (INAUDIBLE) what's good about this. So, Richard, you're my technician and -- you do a lot of work on this. And you're not very bullish. Tell me why.</p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, over the near term it's -- the market is fine. It's in good shape. And we started out with a 3-percent gain for the Dow on Friday. So that's kind of like our handicap for the week, if you will.</p><p>I think, I think the Dow is trying to get up to the Election Day high, which was 9654, something like that. That's when President Obama or soon- to-be President Obama got elected. And so that was the good news.</p><p>Then we had the cascading of bad news that took us down to 7450. So that's kind of a trading range. And we're trying to get back to that Obama high by inauguration.</p><p>GLICK: But you think we will retest those lows?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I think, in the second half of the year, we'll go to lower lows because the second half recovery of 2009 will be as strong as the second half recovery we had in 2008 which everybody was talking about a year ago.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and didn't really happen.</p><p>You know, Charles, a lot is resting on this stimulus package, you know, to the tune of 800 billion, <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>is meeting with officials today on the Hill about it. Now we're hearing about $300 billion in proposed tax cuts.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: I mean, he's starting to really appeal to those blue dog Democrats and making sure that he's putting things in this package that are going to make Republicans and the blue dog Democrats happy.</p><p>How important is this package?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it's very important. You know, I'm working on a -- on a report right now for our subscribers, and I'm comparing his first 100 days in his -- in his presidency to three presidents, FDR, Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, because those are three guys who came in with very serious, ugly economic situations and had to make bold moves.</p><p>It's really a sort of a pleasant surprise, to be honest, that they've been talking about tax cuts to this degree. I would like to see him even friendlier to business. I'd like to see him give businesses a break.</p><p>Multinationals, allow them and bring money that they make overseas back into American without these onerous tax penalties, because that's one of the things that George Bush did that actually, in my opinion, worked, the Jobs Creation Act of 2004. It did create jobs and it brought a lot of money back to our shores.</p><p>So I think Wall Street is going to be excited about that. What's going to be intriguing today is -- today is to see how the infrastructures react to this news, because before it was like a trillion just to repair roads, maybe it won't all go to that.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. Yes. Well -- and part of the Obama camp situation is they need to provide things that are actually going to stimulate the economy and not long-term stimulate but short-term stimulate.</p><p>How do you feel about these new tax cuts?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I think that that...</p><p>GLICK: They're not new actually.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Well...</p><p>GLICK: Some of them will be.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I know, but I mean, come Friday and we see a loss of 500,000 jobs and a 7 percent unemployment rate and the fact that the economy in 2008 lost 2 million jobs, that's going to be hard to stomach in this environment.</p><p>And we need help from the housing market. Mortgages need to be redone. And we have not addressed that. That's what I've been saying for a year.</p><p>GLICK: This is your -- this is your mortgage mulligan that you...</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Absolutely, 100 percent.</p><p>GLICK: So just before we go here, you tell me, the -- what is the quickest, easiest way to solve the housing problem.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Give everybody a mortgage mulligan, a do-over, and I mean the billions of dollars and trillions of dollars that we spent in 2008, if we had had done this a year ago, realizing that there was a problem in the housing market and people needed help making their monthly payments, we wouldn't be in the predicament we are today.</p><p>GLICK: Who pays for the mortgage mulligan?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Who's paying for all the other stuff?</p><p>GLICK: Uncle Sam.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Exactly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: All right.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Uncle Sam. I mean it -- it's not easy to determine who's to bailout -- who to bail out. But any problem is solved from the source. What started all of this? Bad mortgages that shouldn't be given to people. House prices that way -- that were way too high.</p><p>No one's addressed yet the fact that we still have $617 billion in construction and development loans. That's another 3 million homes that are on the books of the bank in terms of loans to builders and developers.</p><p>GLICK: That could fail, yes.</p><p>All right, guys, we're going to -- we have to leave it there.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: Richard, I know you're excited about this and -- give me that TARP list.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: I just want you to know that Richard does more homework than anybody I know. He sends us the best research. He has a five-page list here in the TARP program of what we, the American taxpayer, own.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Look at how little the lines are for -- these are all the companies that we own as taxpayers.</p><p>PAYNE: Over 200 banks; right?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: 282 banks now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: But who's counting?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: And seven of them are private banks. How -- I couldn't even buy one of these if I wanted to.</p><p>GLICK: 282 and counting. All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, we want to welcome our newest viewers on Cox and Charter Communications in Hartford, Connecticut. That city is known as the insurance capital of America. Home to insurance giants the big ones, Aetna and the Hartford.</p><p>You know the insurance industry pumps about $12 billion into Connecticut's economy and competes with other states such as Iowa for insurance payrolls and tax revenues.</p><p>With more on the state of the insurance industry and Hartford, I'm joined by Thomas Sullivan. He is Connecticut insurance commissioner, and Bob Hartwig is president and economist for Insurance Information Institute.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: Tom, let me start with you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: You know we're in the midst of a very serious economic downturn. A lot of talk about the insurance industry in the wake of what happened to AIG last year.</p><p>What is this face of it? How -- how is it shaping up to look in 2009?</p><p>THOMAS SULLIVAN, CONNECTICUT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER: Well, the insurance sector has felt some of the pinch of the general economy, quite frankly, the insurance sector has been a little bit more depressed than general S&amp;P and some of the broader indexes.</p><p>But, overall, the -- industry is in good shape. We haven't had any major insolvencies. We haven't had really any insolvencies. And when you point out AIG, I would point out to you that AIG, its frailty has occurred in its holding company which is not regulated by state regulators like myself.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Bob, when we talk about insurance, we can go in so many different directions, obviously. There's life, there's property, there's casualty, but one thing the insurance industry normally does very well is it prepares for risks or shocks to the system.</p><p>Has it been better prepared than perhaps the rest of the financial arena, particularly what we saw in 2008?</p><p>BOB HARTWIG, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: Well, absolutely. Every day the insurance industry has to assume that the worse case scenario could happen, whether it's something like a 9/11, or a Hurricane Katrina, or a stock market wash out.</p><p>Sometimes all these happen -- happen at the same time. So we're prepared for that. So just take a look at the numbers. In 2008, 25 banks failed. Not a single insurance company failed as a result of the financial crisis, and so I think that's a very important distinction.</p><p>So at the end of this, I think that we'll see the insurers emerge with their risk management model which is one where we always retain some of the risk, we don't pack it off, sell it off to the securities markets and forget about it. We retain the risk, we have skin in the game every inch along the way.</p><p>GLICK: OK, and Bob, we should also differentiate, too, between life insurance and property and casualty, because I imagine that life insurance in a recessionary like environment like this would feel some heat because in essence it is one long-term source of an investment vehicle.</p><p>HARTWIG: Well, that's right. Some insurers can invest -- life insurers can invest for a longer term so they may be sensitive to fluctuations in different types of asset prices. That has happened but nevertheless they do build up very strong capital positions, designed to be resilient in market downturns.</p><p>The industry is very, very heavily regulated. It's also one that's fairly transparent. Have there been some short sellers having their way for times -- for periods of time in the market? That has happened. But the reality is insurers are writing new policies paying claims just as they did before the crisis hit.</p><p>GLICK: And, Tom, let me go back to the state of Connecticut. We talked about two of the largest insurers in the world, Aetna and Hartford, but you're also seeing competition with places like Iowa trying to get big insurers in there.</p><p>What are you doing on a state basis right now to make sure that this remains the capital of the insurance industry?</p><p>HARTWIG: Well, our -- hallmark has been insurance in terms of our economy and the state of Connecticut, Governor Rell and her administration have focused a lot of attention on the industry.</p><p>We've set up through the metro Hartford alliance effectively our chamber of commerce here in Hartford, an insurance and financial services cluster so that we can continue to leverage the talent that Connecticut has to be able to deliver to the insurance industry.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Tom and Bob, we're going to leave it there. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.</p><p>HARTWIG: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up, in today's economy, why would anyone want to start a new football league? Well, the Arena Football League folded its operations but now a new league plans to compete with the NFL. We're going to talk to United Football League commissioner coming up next.</p><p>And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill this morning. We're going to find out what changes might be in store for the SEC when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns. Stay with us. We'll be back in a few minutes.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Well, this past weekend the road to the Super Bowl kicked off with the NFL playoff. I was glued to the television as usual.</p><p>Well, although the economy is down, sports economists expect the NFL to see an increase in the league's 2007 revenues which exceeded $7 billion. Those numbers have a couple of former finance executives thinking that there may be room for more pro football so they formed the United Football League.</p><p>It has six cities ready to go and is talking about giving fans an IPO investment in those franchises.</p><p>Here with the details on their deal I'm joined by UFL founder Bill Hambrecht. He's the CEO of the financial services firm WR Hambrecht and Company. And Michael Huyghue. He's the commissioner of the UFL and a former NFL executive.</p><p>Michael, let me start with you. There are a lot of people out there who say how could you consider doing something like this in this economy, particularly given what we have seen with the football, the Arena League which just folded?</p><p>Tell me a little bit about it and why you think you can do it.</p><p>MICHAEL HUYGHUE, UNIFIED FOOTBALL LEAGUE COMMISSIONER: Well, I'm a passionate football fan. And I think there's millions of passionate football fans. You just mentioned, you're watching the NFL games.</p><p>Our league is really a great opportunity for the spillover of talented football players to get an opportunity to play.</p><p>Kurt Warner is a classic example of a player who was sort of missed in the original selection of players in the NFL and he's had a prosperous career. There's hundreds of those type of players. And we just want to provide those opportunities as well as for coaches and front office executives.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Bill, you were known for what you have done in the investment and the Wall Street community, and here it is,. you're starting a football league. It doesn't necessarily go together.</p><p>Tell me why you wanted to do this.</p><p>BILL HAMBRECHT, UFL FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN: Well, I thought there was a great attraction to having a football franchise owned by the public and by the fans and by the people who live in, in the city where the franchise is located.</p><p>So to me the -- my world of finance and IPOs and the football world came together.</p><p>GLICK: So Bill, so tell me how that works? Because you're talking about a stake, many people will liken to what happens with the Green Bay Packers, for example, but tell me how will this situation work.</p><p>I understand it'll be in as many as sixteen and cities to start.</p><p>HAMBRECHT: That's correct. There will be six cities, six independent franchises, and each franchise will be financed by local people, both private investors and public investors.</p><p>GLICK: So Michael you have, as we mentioned in the very beginning, you're a former NFL executive. You know what works in the football world, in the football community, and this is a different idea at a time when most people would say how could you possibly get the funding?</p><p>How do you get the participation? How do you get the players and the -- money to pay them the necessary salaries? Walk me through.</p><p>HUYGHUE: Sure.</p><p>COLLINS: How are you putting this all together.</p><p>HUYGHUE: Well, you know, it's an interesting time.</p><p>Clearly the economy is a tough time, but there are a number of people that are looking for opportunity. And our league is one of innovation. We are finding people that are excited about football in their markets that don't have NFL franchises to support.</p><p>They believe in the concept that there's a lot off talented football players out there. And so they're putting groups together. Each franchise is run by a chairman and he has five or six or seven local independent investors with them.</p><p>An d they're funding about $60 million to operate this franchises. We have about a $20 million player salary cap and we're going to get some exciting players. You know, I ran, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for the first seven years and I saw the same type of players I think we'll get in our league.</p><p>GLICK: And Michael, I have heard rumblings that you would even consider, perhaps if you could, trying to attract somebody like Michael Vick now that that Ryan is over at the falcons at the falcons and doing fairly well, one could argue -- doing well until this weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>GLICK: But -- is that true?</p><p>HUYGHUE: Well, it's going to be a league of opportunity. And we're certainly going to let the fans have a say in almost everything we do. In fact, we're putting up on our Web site Vick or no Vick? And he'll be one example of many players that will consider, of course, players like that have some interesting backgrounds, considerations that we'll have to consider.</p><p>But there's going to be a league of opportunity, and certainly he'll be one example of many players we will consider. Players like that have interesting background considerations that we will have to consider. It is going to be a league of opportunity. Certainly he will be one consideration.</p><p>GLICK: Bill, you know, I guess the number one thing you guys have to figure out is how you are going to differentiate yourself given particularly what has happened with the Arena Football League.</p><p>You tell me, how are you going to do that?</p><p>HAMBRECHT: Well, I think the big differentiation is that we're going into markets that the NFL is not established in or is leaving. So -- you know, basically the NFL has done a lot of things really well. They, they have a great product. They have a great sport. And they have, you know, just done a wonderful job of implementing.</p><p>But they have not expanded into some of the major growth areas of the United States. I mean, it is amazing when you think about it that Los Angeles does not have its own franchise.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>HAMBRECHT: Nor Las Vegas.</p><p>GLICK: So true. You know, Michael, before I let you go, I understand some big announcements will come during Super Bowl week, and that is it by as early as March 1, we will know the teams, and you'll start, you know, having people try out?</p><p>HUYGHUE: Yes, exactly right. We will have an announcement around Super Bowl week announcing the six owners and general managers and presidents. We already have a $20 million training facility in Casa Grande, Arizona that the city is building for as far as teams to compete in.</p><p>So we've got a lot of things. We start signing players March 1st. So we're really excited about the events coming up.</p><p>GLICK: I'm excited. More football is a good thing.</p><p>Michael Huyghue, great to see you, and Bill Hambrecht, as well.</p><p>Good luck guys and keep us up-to-date and come back during Super Bowl week to give us the first dibs on those cities. We'll analyze right here.</p><p>All right, gentlemen, thanks.</p><p>Let's get the very latest headlines with Jenna Lee. Good morning, Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: ... taking a look at politics first.</p><p>President elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>is working on a tax cut plan which could be worth as much as $300 dollars.</p><p>Mr. Obama and leading Democrats are hoping the tax cuts will entice Republican support. Mr. Obama was hoping to get the bill written and ready for him to sign the day he takes office. But many say mid to early February is more likely timeline.</p><p>The tax cuts, by the way, are part of an economic stimulus plan worth as much as $775 billion dollars over the next two years. At least that's reportedly how much it is worth.</p><p>And last night Mr. Obama officially landed in Washington, D.C. His wife and daughters made the trip on Saturday. He said he's looking forward to being in Washington, but not exactly looking forward to living in a hotel for two weeks.</p><p>His daughters start a new school this morning. That's why they decided to go to Washington two weeks before the inauguration.</p><p>Well, imagine the situation. You've got an interview for the job you want, but if you take the interview, you are going to get fired from the job you have.</p><p>Boston college football coach, Jeff Jagodzinski, was just -- just led his team to a bowl game, faces that very situation. He's set to interview for the head coaching job with the New York Jets, but the ESPN reports if he does Boston College is actually going to fire him.</p><p>Apparently, though, the coach reportedly plans to go ahead with the plans and interview anyways.</p><p>I guess no risk, no reward.</p><p>You're up-to-date now the FOX Business Network. Now it's time for \"Charles's choice.\"</p><p>GLICK: Unbelievable. Getting fired for having a conversation with the JETS, unbelievable.</p><p>All right. In his Wall Street strategies hot line, Charles Payne says the start to a new year of trading Friday was surreal as retailers, homebuilders and tech stocks fared better than they should have and he says more good news could be coming.</p><p>\"The broad market or the board market has a nice wind in its sails and most of the major equity indices are on the verge of big-time breakouts.\"</p><p>Joining me now with more on this is -- in my bullish Mr. Charles Payne.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: So you're feeling good.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, and particularly from a short-term point of view. You know, it's interesting, Richard Suttmeier spoke earlier about his technical parameters, same thing. I'm looking at the Dow, there really is no resistance between 9000 and 9600.</p><p>S&amp;P is on the cusp of a major breakout as well. So you're going to get a lot of momentum players who've been sitting on the sidelines who feel like, you know what, better hop on this train.</p><p>GLICK: But do you also agree with Richard that we could, at some point this year, retest the lows?</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. You know, I think what we're -- we're putting hope and - anticipation. A lot of this is rationalization.</p><p>GLICK: Around the inauguration, right?</p><p>PAYNE: It can't get worse than this. There's going to be a lot of money, and how long can we keep shrugging off bad news?</p><p>You know we'll see Friday will be the first test. If the numbers come in more than 500,000 people lost their jobs and the market still goes up, then I say ride this wave, but understand at some point these numbers do mean something.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Negatively.</p><p>GLICK: At some point the shoe has to drop.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Let's look at a couple of the names. First one, SalesForce.com.</p><p>PAYNE: SalesForce.com. You can see where the stock is really beginning -- you know, you can see it has some resistance right there. It's beginning to turn around here. This is a stock that I like a lot. We've talked about this before in the past. I think they're going to be acquired.</p><p>I will say, though, Alexis, it's an expensive stock, it's not cheap. It's trading at a six times book. Nevertheless, technically, it breaks out at 35, from there it has room to 40. And if they are acquired, it's been in the rumor mill for about two years.</p><p>GLICK: OK, and remind us, what do they do?</p><p>PAYNE: They do software. They compete with -- SAP and Oracle. In fact this guy who started this company used to work with Oracle and it just -- it's one of these things. I don't know if I would consider it mission critical but certainly, in this sort of economic environment, businesses would buy software to try to make things work out for them as opposed to spending money elsewhere.</p><p>GLICK: OK. CNH Global. Tell me about this company.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, you've heard of their products. Case, New Holland, big equipment, you know, a lot of agricultural stuff. Also a lot of construction stuff. And you know, this whole stimulus thing that we're talking about, same sort of thing.</p><p>You can see where the stock is just building a base here.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, building the bottom there.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. So right in the air, once it breaks through that point, I think it's off to the races. But, not just stimulus in America, you know, China, Europe, everywhere we're going to be seeing a demand for these sort of products.</p><p>The last two quarters they blew the cover off the ball but the quarters before that they missed. But this stock is so cheap down here. I love the risk-reward.</p><p>GLICK: OK. We have to leave it here. I know we're going to go into another one but we've got a lot more stuff to cover.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Charles, thank you very much. Good tips.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it. All right. s</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up we're going to go \"In the Pit.\" We're going to talk Madoff, more on the scheme and what, of course, will happen today in D.C. when -- testimony begins at 2:00 p.m. today. House Financial Services Committee are going to talk about it.</p><p>Also we want to welcome -- look at this.</p><p>PAYNE: Vegas. Whoa.</p><p>GLICK: Cox Communications in Vegas. We love Vegas.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely.</p><p>GLICK: We'd like to go visit you in Vegas. All right, that's coming up next. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Congress will be searching for answers today in a $50 billion scheme allegedly tied to <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff. </nameText></person>Lawmakers are going to be grilling the Securities and Exchange Commission over why it is that it took so long to uncover the scandal.</p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" this morning saying that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years. Now the SEC also reportedly followed up on e-mails from a New York hedge fund that described madoff's business practices as highly unusual and yet nothing was done about it which is so incredibly frustrating.</p><p>Then, of course, we learn now that there are all these offshore accounts as well. What do you make of this?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, it's -- sort of the stuff that main street has always, you know -</p><p>GLICK: Paranoid about.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, that the fix is in, that the big guys everyone looks the other way even that -- even when they go in there, but this -- it's a very complicated situation.</p><p>I think the SEC needs to train their personnel a lot better, you know, the thing about today's hearings, though, the guy holding it, the representative, Paul (INAUDIBLE), I'm a little worried because he's already made certain comments, which makes me -- for instance, he's saying this whole thing provides a glaring example of Congress must provide reforms.</p><p>GLICK: Do something about regulation.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. So, you know, are we going in there to try to figure out the answers or are we going in there with preconceived, you know, political, and you know...</p><p>GLICK: He's been fighting for more...</p><p>PAYNE: ... determination.</p><p>GLICK: He's been fighting for mire regulatory oversights since 2000 so this is going to give a lot of people who want more of regulatory...</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt about that but the question is, is that the problem? I mean after all the man was investigated.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: The investigations were run poorly. But he was investigated.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE: And you have -- you had personal experience on that Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LEE: You thought that the people that came to your shop had weren't really equip to do it.</p><p>PAYNE: They had no clue. We I say no clue, it was sad. I men it's really weird, you know? You know as a registered investment adviser you get -- audited periodically. So we're being audited. They had two young kids right out of college. And they really had, what I said, Alexis, no clue. It was sad.</p><p>GLICK: That is what the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said to us this morning is you've to do something about the examiners, you know e young kids coming out of college.</p><p>They are not going to know how to look for loopholes in a $0 billion investment firm. Let's leave it there.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's leave it there. Of course, we're going to continue to talk about that. Hearings will be at 2:00 p.m. today. We'll be covering that.</p><p>And coming up next, we're going to talk about Obama's fiscal stimulus plan. What does it look like? That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick. Happy new year.</p><p>In this hour, we're going to take a look at <person><nameText>President-elect Obama's </nameText></person>new stimulus plan. And Woolworth's will close its doors overseas. So why does it have a business impact here? We're going to explain. And the latest installment of America's greatest business rivalries. It's a good one. It's about the burger wars. It's McDonald's versus Burger King.</p><p>But first, take a quick look at the futures here in the U.S. because this is going to be a very busy week for economic data, in particular those unemployment numbers due out this Friday. Right now the Dow is down 35 points. The S&amp;P is down 4. Nasdaq up 3. It's pretty much unchanged to start the morning.</p><p>Well, let's start hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with the three things you should know this morning.</p><p>President-elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and congressional Democrats are looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and businesses. This is an attempt to gain Republican support for its more than $700 billion economic stimulus package. We'll talk more about that in a moment.</p><p>And French President Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with Israeli President Shimon Perez. The two leaders will hold a working political meeting to discuss political and security issues in Gaza. Sarkozy will also met with the Palestinian Authority leaders in an attempt to push for a cease fire in the ongoing Gaza conflict.</p><p>And the Bernard Madoff scandal goes to Washington. The House Financial Services Committee beginning an open session this afternoon exploring the $50 billion Ponzi scheme. In the hot seat will be the Securities and Exchange Commission's inspector general after \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in as many as 16 years.</p><p>All right. Those are the three top stories you need to know about this morning. Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas market, let's go visit Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>Good morning, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis, and good morning, everybody.</p><p>We've had a positive day of trading in Asia overnight on this first full week of trading for 2009. And here in Europe, well, we're desperately hanging on, trying to stay positive but we're starting to sink just a little bit. Let's take a look at the latest numbers. Here in London, on the FTSE 100, we're now down about 0.2 percent. In France, on the CAC 40, down about 0.1. We've been in the same range ever since the opening bell. And the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up slightly by 0.1 percent. So not a whole lot of conviction right now.</p><p>But some bad news today, or some sad news certainly. It's been in business since 1759 in Ireland, but no more. Not unless a buyer can be found. Irish company Waterford Wedgwood announcing today it is calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection. The Irish group best known for Wedgwood pottery, Royal Doulton and Waterford Crystal, collapsed after talks over a possible investment in the business failed.</p><p>A glimmer of hope. Take it where you can. European investor confidence increased for the first time in seven months in January thanks to low interest rates and government measures to stimulate the economy. The latest index rising from minus 42 to minus 34. Doesn't sound that great, but the biggest jump in more than three years. And we'll take it.</p><p>Now let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Ashley.</p><p>Keeping an eye on a number of things today, including the U.S. automakers. The big three from Detroit set to release their sales figures for the month of December and the rest of 2008 today. As you might expect, those numbers are expected to be pretty dismal. The American car maker selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08. That's the forecast. If that's the case, the biggest drop since 1974, while the foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW, this morning, speeding towards an expansion. Their stateside market, there's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about those expansion plans today as we look at the GM and Ford stock prices.</p><p>Now, number two, we want to take a look here at Walgreen for a moment. The drugstore chain just coming out as we speak with some same-store sales numbers for last month, the month of December. And it looks like stores open at least a year saw sales increased by 4.9 percent, as we look at Walgreen's stock price there. And that one over -- that one-year time span you're looking at is down about 25 percent. And it says that some calendar shifts had a positive impact on the month. And the pharmacy sales, comparable sales there, were up by 8.5 percent. And overall sales up almost 11 percent, 10.8. But again, sales at stores open at least a year up almost 5 percent at Walgreen.</p><p>And number three is Boeing, securing a contract worth $2.1 billion with India. The aircraft manufacturer is going to deliver at least 8 of the P- 81 anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare airplanes in the next four years. Boeing's looking to -- a bid for India defense projects totaling up to$20 billion over the course of 10 years.</p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning, Alexis. Back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>prepared to meet with economic leaders and economic advisors today in Washington. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the future president is crafting a plan that could provide over $300 billion in tax cuts. Fox Business' senior Washington correspondent Peter Barnes joins us with the very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Alexis.</p><p>The president-elect will start negotiating the details of a massive new stimulus plan, which may total around $700 billion, $800 billion or so, to save or create up to 3 million jobs. And we can confirm now that the president-elect will propose tax cuts of about $300 billion as part of that plan. That's from Democratic sources on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the plan's major provisions as we know them this morning. There would be $150 billion in tax cuts and tax credits for workers. $100 billion or so in tax breaks for companies to create jobs and to make new investments in plant and equipment.</p><p>The plan would extend unemployment benefits, including to part-time workers for the first time. The plan would expand Medicaid to unemployed workers, also for the first time. And other provisions could include subsidies to employers who continue health insurance coverage to laid off and retired workers.</p><p>All of this on the table today when the president-elect meets with top Democrats and Republicans on The Hill. The tax cut provisions, something that Republicans have been looking for, to support a stimulus plan.</p><p>The goal has been to try to get the work on the stimulus plan done and approved by both the House and Senate by the time Mr. Obama is inaugurated on January 20th, but congressional leaders warning this weekend that they will need more time to consider the plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: It's going to be very difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have sufficient time to be reviewed and then sufficient time to be debated and passed. But we certainly want to see this package passed through the House of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the Senate and have it to the president before we break for the presidential break.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": And that's mid February?</p><p>HOYER: Early February, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: And that, Steny Hoyer speaking with our own Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" yesterday.</p><p>Mr. Obama has his first meeting this morning at 11:00 with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Peter Barnes, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, Mr. Obama says his proposed American recovery and reinvest plan is crucial to not only solving the current economic problems facing America, but challenges that may come along in the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>(D) PRESIDENT-ELECT: We need an American recovery and reinvest plan that not only creates jobs in the short term, but spurs economic growth and competitiveness in the long term. And this plan must be designed in a new way. We can't just fall into the old Washington habit of throwing money at the problem. We must make strategic investments that will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, for more on that estimated $775 billion stimulus plan, and if it will kick-start the economy, I'm joined by Dr. Peter Morici, an economist with the University of Maryland, and Erin Billings, the associate editor of the Capitol Hill newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Good morning, guys. Great to see you.</p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, good to see you. Happy new year.</p><p>DR. PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND ECONOMIST: Happy new year.</p><p>GLICK: So you hear this morning about $300 billion in tax cuts. You're probably falling over in your chair. Wow, is he speaking of blue dog Democrats and Republicans or what?</p><p>MORICI: He absolutely is speaking to blue dog Democrats and Republicans. One problem I do see, though, is it's so complex. I mean the investment provisions are fairly arcane, which is going to lead to a lot of negotiations. And ultimately that's going to take time.</p><p>One of the advantages of a tax cut is it bites faster. But infrastructure spending gives you more bang for the buck longer term. If he wants strategic investments, that's the place to find them. The kinds of tax cuts he's talk about pretty much are retreads of past stimulus packages.</p><p>GLICK: Well, it's interesting, Erin, because, you know, there have been those who have suggested that the lions share of this fiscal stimulus package would be directed toward, you know, types of -- different types of infrastructure projects and yet here he is coming out with what could be tax cuts that far exceed those that President Bush put in twice during his eight years as president. I mean that's got to be a little bit of a shocker.</p><p>ERIN BILLINGS, \"ROLL CALL\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Well, Obama clearly is trying to lead from the center. And he knows he can't pass this if he doesn't have Republicans on board. They want tax cuts and he knows he needs them to come on board and sign on. So that's what we're seeing here.</p><p>He's trying to come up with something that will appeal to the masses. That's why he's taking the salesmanship directly to The Hill. He's meeting with these guys and he's saying, look, there's something in it for everybody. And he knows he's going to have to pass this with probably 80 votes in the Senate, and he wants a very strong majority in the House as well. This can't be a Democratic bill.</p><p>GLICK: OK. So, Peter, if we're talking about $800 billion, let's say for the sake of argument, we know $300 billion is directed towards tax incentives and loopholes and all those kinds of things, many of which are for small business owners. You tell me, when he has talked about 2.5 million, now up to 3 million either created or saved jobs, where does the jobs component of this fiscal stimulus plan factor in? Where are we going to create those jobs?</p><p>MORICI: Well, if we spend money and we get people buying goods and services again, we're going to get a multiplier effect. If we spend $100 billion on infrastructure, we'll get a $200 billion multiplier effect on GDP. Bottom line is, he has to raise GDP by about $330 billion to create 3 million new jobs, which means he has to spend, in the first year, about $330 billion because it takes some time to get the money out. So look for a stimulus package, if it's going to be consistent with this goal, of somewhere around $350 billion spent in '09, and about $350 billion spent in 2010.</p><p>GLICK: All right. So, Erin, walk me through the Republican argument here, because there are a lot of Republicans who are not to thrilled about this concept here. What do they not like about an $800 billion fiscal stimulus package?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you just said it, $800 billion. That's what they don't like. You know, the Republicans are trying to reclaim this fiscal discipline mantle that they enjoyed for the last, you know, what, 40 years, 30 years. They lost their way. They're trying to find it again. And they need to prove to the American public that they know who they are. And a big part of that is maintaining that fiscal discipline. They want to be the check and the balance on this new administration. So clearly that's where it starts.</p><p>Secondly, they want these tax provisions. They've been pushing for that behind the scenes. It looks like they're probably going to get it.</p><p>Thirdly, they want some time. They don't want to just have this rammed down their throats. They don't want to look like they're rubber stamping anything that the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is bringing to The Hill. So they're going to try and at least slow the process so they can have input and try to at least get their imprint on it.</p><p>And so I think what you'll see at the end of the day is, we will have some kind of compromise proposal. It's not going to be everything Obama is laying out right now. It's it's probably not going to get done till February. I mean if the Democrats are lucky, they'll get it right before this February recess we're looking at, which begins on the 16th, I believe, of February. And Republicans are not going to sign on unless they get some of their wants in there.</p><p>GLICK: Well, and the good news is, at least a realistic expectations are being set and we're preparing the markets by telling then.</p><p>Peter, here's my opportunity, it's the new year, to get your assessment of where this economy is headed. This Friday we have probably -- arguably one of the most important numbers. We'll get the unemployment numbers for December, non-farm payrolls. Where is the economy headed?</p><p>MORICI: Well, in terms of numbers, we probably haven't seen the worst of it. GDP was only down a half a point in the third quarter. Fourth quarter GDP will probably be down 5 percent on an annualized basis. And in the next quarter, another 2 percent or 3 percent. So we're likely to see job losses continue through the first quarter.</p><p>Also, if we get a stimulus package say by the end of February, we're not going to get checks out to people until May 1. And we're not going to get any infrastructure spending till the second half of the year. So if we're looking for recovery in the economy, it's the second half.</p><p>However, don't be too down on the stock market because the stock market has factored this all in. Economists have been saying this for quite some time now. And so my feeling is the stock market has bottomed out and it will get its legs as long as the Democrat appear able to bridge the gap, reach consensus with the Republicans, as long as they're confident that the stimulus package is coming, businesses will see brighter prospects for the second half of the year and the market will lead us out of the recession. It won't be a lagging indicator, rather it will anticipate the recovery.</p><p>GLICK: Erin, the 11th Congress goes into session tomorrow. There's a lot of new Democrats taking positions. There's a perception out there that <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>will accomplish more because he's got more Democrats on his side. But he's clearly made some significant gestures over the past six weeks about what he's willing to do by walking across the aisle. Will they have success this year, not just for the fiscal stimulus plan, but with accomplishing other major intended goals?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, that's a great question. I mean, as you know, <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>ran as a candidate of change. He ran as a consensus candidate. And now he's going to try and govern as a consensus president. That is a real test. It's very easy to talk the talk. But now he's got to walk the walk.</p><p>As you mentioned, he's been reaching out to congressional Republicans. He's had his surrogates reach out to congressional Republicans in, you know, in the weeks after he won the election on November 4th. And now it really gets down to bras tax.</p><p>I mean the first real test is this economic stimulus. If he can get this through with bipartisan support, then I think that really is a harbinger of things to come. He's laid out a bunch of agenda items that are largely consensus items, but the stimulus may or may not be. So, you know, we'll have to see. It's going to take some time.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, time will tell.</p><p>BILLINGS: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it's going to be very interesting because, you know, we sort of put health care and a lot of the other top issues on the back burner, all to talk about this stimulus program, which makes a lot of sense given the current environment.</p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, happy new year. As always, great seeing you.</p><p>And, Erin, stay with me because, Erin, you and I are going to talk about one of the big topics going into this 111th Congress because the other big story on The Hill is the man who's been tapped by (ph) Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to fill Mr. Obama's vacant Senate seat. Roland Burris will also be on Capitol Hill this week to begin his new job. Burris is facing opposition because of the Blagojevich scandal to sell Mr. Obama's seat. On yesterday's \"Meet the Press,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who's defended his right to block Burris' appointment, said anything could happen. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, \"MEET THE PRESS\": There sounds to me like there may be some room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID, (D) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Hey, listen, David, I'm an old trial lawyer. There's always room to negotiate.</p><p>GREGORY: All right. So you're not saying no completely that he won't serve? That's what you're saying?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: All right. So what Burris will encounter in Washington and what role his financial background may play, we go back to Erin Billings. She's the associate editor of the Capitol newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Erin, we only have just about 60 seconds here. What do you expect to happen in the coming days and how will that impact his ability to be sworn in as senator of Illinois?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you know, as you know, the new Congress kicks off tomorrow. Roland Burris has said he's coming to down. The Democratic leaders are going to meet with him on Wednesday and I think they're going to try and kind of talk him down. Tell him, hey, maybe you should just back off. Let's see what happens with Governor Blagojevich.</p><p>As you know, the general assembly is moving to impeach him. I think the Democrats would ideally like to have him ousted and then the lieutenant governor could then make the selection. But you're right, Harry Reid left the door just slightly ajar. And even though his aides are now saying, well, there's not really room for negotiation. He may -- you know, maybe they're reading too much into it. Certainly Harry Reid doesn't do things on accident.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. No, I mean, it was interesting Harry Reid's comments there yesterday. He was really couching it. But is there a chance that the Senate will say no, you cannot take the seat?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, I don't think there's really a lot of support to give him the seat, even on the Republican side. I mean the Republicans, Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said on Sunday on a different show that, you know, that there should be a special election in Illinois to deal with this. And so everyone is looking at this cloud of corruption and no one seems to think that this is the process by which they should appoint the new senator from Illinois.</p><p>So I think it would be a really heavy lift unless there was some kind of a bipartisan deal. Harry Reid is going to meet with McConnell this morning, or today, to talk about the situation. I think they're going to try and figure out if there's a bipartisan road to go down. But it's anybody's guess.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Erin Billings, thank you so much for sticking with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>BILLINGS: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we'll talk more about what's going on in the Gaza Strip and what the implications might be for Israel.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the pressure is mounting on Israel to stop its 10-day offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But Israel says the attacks will continue until militants stop firing rockets at its citizens. Fox New's David Lee Miller is live on the Gaza border this morning with the very latest.</p><p>Good morning, David.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>That's right. The defense minister, Ehud Barak, paid a visit to some of the troops on the front lines a little earlier today and he also said today, speaking at the Connesset (ph), that the Israeli offensive is going to continue until there is peace and tranquility along Israel's border with Gaza.</p><p>Today, nevertheless, at least 24 rockets have been fired. In fact, that was the figure up until we went on the air. Then shortly -- I'd say less than 30 seconds ago, another rocket was fired off in the distance headed into Israel. So that makes at least 25 rockets that have been fired today. A number of them literally flew over our heads. One reaching as far as 25 miles into Israel, into the city of Beersheva.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the ground, Israeli forces have effectively now surrounded Gaza City. Gaza City and its nearly half a million residents. There has been a great deal of fighting on the ground. But for the most part, the Israeli forces are staying out of the urban areas. They are staying on the outskirts of Gaza City.</p><p>Hamas, meanwhile, is trying to draw them into the more urban environments for some type of guerrilla conflict. The Israelis say that they are constantly moving on the ground. In the words of one commander, they don't want to be sitting ducks. They are there to find the militants.</p><p>Now, as for the death toll, the figures provided by Palestinian medics, they say that as many as 60 Palestinians have been killed, only six of which they say were militants. The remainder, they say, are civilians and many of them are children. These are figures that we cannot independently confirm. As for the Israeli casualties, one soldier has been killed since the ground incursion got underway. And as many as 40 have been injured.</p><p>And, lastly, there is some progress to report on the diplomatic front. We've got the EU involved, the French president involved, the United Nations involved. Perhaps the best hope for some type of diplomatic solution here now, Alexis, is a delegation that has -- I am told we've got another strike off in the distance. You can see the cloud of black plume of smoke.</p><p>Let me finish making my point as you take a look at this latest Israeli air strike. A delegation of Hamas has left Syria, heading towards Egypt, for a meting tomorrow. It is expected at this meeting the Egyptians are going to demand that Hamas move forward with the cease fire process and stop the rocket attacks. What influence they're going to have, that is somewhat questionable. Only a short time ago, before this conflict began, Egypt asked Hamas to stop the rocket attacks. Hamas ignored that request. This time around maybe they'll see things differently with Israeli forces on the ground, in the air, and at sea, all targeting Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: David, I imagine, you know, just watching that bomb go off behind you there, that you're in a very dangerous area there on the border in Gaza. Just give us some feeling of what's going on around you as we're kind of watching this unfold. I imagine this is pretty scary.</p><p>MILLER: It's a little unnerving at first. I won't say you get used to it, but this is the way people live along southern Israel, and they have been living for years with these rocket attacks a regular part of their lives. But recently, because of the increase in these rocket attacks, life had to change. They've stopped school. Parties have been stopped. Social events had to be rescheduled. So there has been a significant change in people's lives here.</p><p>But for the most part, for most Israelis, life does go on. This is something they have to cope with. They just have to change their daily habits. But when these rockets are launched, you've got 15 to 45 seconds to take cover. And let me tell you -- I'm losing my voice here -- that 15 seconds can be a very, very long. You wait 15 seconds for that rocket to hit and you just hope it's not going to land anywhere near you.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right. David Lee Miller, be safe. Thank you very much, from Fox News, for joining us this morning, bringing us up to date on this story.</p><p>All right, guys. Well, from what's going on in the Gaza Strip, to what's going on with the <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff </nameText></person>scandal. Coming up next, we're going to bring you up to date on the very latest on this 2:00 p.m. committee sub hearing about what happened here and all the ties. It's a terrible story. But, of course, we'll bring you up to date on that in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WEBSTER: And welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Ashley Webster in London, keeping track of the overseas markets for you.</p><p>And it's generally been positive, certainly in Asia overnight. And we started positively enough here in Europe, although perhaps not with a lot of conviction. But now sentiment has turned just a little more bearish.</p><p>Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you in London. We've been up about a quarter to a half a percent for most of the day so far. But now we've turned negative. We're down now about a half a percent on the FTSE, down 28 points. Also on the CAC 40 in Paris, down half a percent. And on the DAX 30 in Germany, also down about a third of a percent.</p><p>There has been some speculation, of course, of a big stimulus package being passed by the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>when it comes into power. That gave some impetus, if you like, to the Asian trading. But so far into Europe haven't picked up on that sentiment quite strongly, although we have seen the higher oil prices lift some of the sectors. The oil sector certainly benefitting from that. Although now we're seeing even the oil stocks turn slightly negative. Royal Dutch Shell down now 3 percent.</p><p>We're also seeing some weakness in the European auto sector, including a couple of downgrades today for both Renault in France and Porsche. New car registrations in France plunged in December, down 24 percent. All of this spelling more tough news for the automakers. Renault down 5 percent in Paris. Porsche also down now 5 percent.</p><p>We've also seen a lot of money coming out of gold. Gold trading in London down $26 an ounce to right around $853. As a result, though, we've seen the dollar get stronger against most of the foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound. The dollar coming in right now at 1.44 against the British pound.</p><p>All right. Back to New York now and Jenna Lee for the latest news headlines.</p><p>Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you so much, Ashley.</p><p>And we begin with a sad story to update you on. We could soon find out what killed Jett Travolta. Today, an autopsy will be done on the 16-year- old's body. And it is believed at this time that he had a seizure and hit his head on the bathtub. Of course, Jett is the son of actor John Travolta, and as well as actress Kelly Preston. They released a statement saying, \"Jett was the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for. We are heart broken that our time with him was so brief.\" So, again, we'll keep you updated as we hear more.</p><p>In the meantime, we're just going to turn to another story coming off the weekend. The new year's weekend box office went to the dogs this time. 20th century Fox's \"Marley &amp; Me\" held on to the top spot, pulling in just over $24 million. Disney's \"Bedtime Stories\" came in second with just $20.3 million. It was followed by Paramount's \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" United Artists \"Valkyrie\" and Warner Brother's \"Yes Man.\" All those rounding out the top five.</p><p>Also, Will Smith has been voted the top money-making movie star of 2008 in the 76th annual Quigley Poll. The star of Columbia Pictures, \"Seven Pounds\" is the only -- the second African-American actor after Sydney Poitier to top t he poll. Robert Downey Jr. came in second and Christian Bale claimed third.</p><p>All right. You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network. Coming up, we're going to take a look at one of America's greatest business rivalries. It's the king versus Ronald McDonald. The battle of two multi-billion dollar companies continues to heat up. Stay with us. You don't want to miss it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>This half-hour, we're going to take a look at the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King, two of my favorites. And we're going to look at the end of the road for retail giant Woolworth.</p><p>And Fox 50 member Federal Express is raising rates as its shipping volume continues to slip. Will it affect the stock? We'll talk about that.</p><p>Take a quick look at the futures, as we're one hour away from the market opening right now.</p><p>The Dow is now down 50, we're down about half a percent. The S&amp;P, as you can see, is down about 6 points. It's down about .6 percent. And the Nasdaq is also down about half a percent.</p><p>We're at the lows of the morning. We'll see how that shapes up as we head closer to the bell.</p><p>Now it is time for this week's edition of \"America's Greatest Business Rivals.\"</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Alexis.</p><p>In this week's edition of the series here ongoing, we do heat up these burger wars, McDonald's and Burger King. Burger King brought in $2.5 billion in the year 2008, while McDonald's earned $6.3 billion in the third quarter alone. So that kind of tells you how they stack up against each other. Certainly a lot of hamburgers no matter how you slice it.</p><p>And while the two of them expand their empires here in 2009 to offer items like lattes, even burger-scented body spray, apparently, we're going to take a look back now at where these two rivals first fired up their grills.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE (voice-over): The Big Mac versus the Whopper. Flame broiled versus grilled. McDonald's versus Burger King. It's one of America's hottest business rivals that, after more than 50 years, shows no slowing down in the fast food wars.</p><p>Burger King and McDonald's burst onto the scene during the all-American 1950s. Burger King set up shop in 1954 and McDonald's in 1955. Since then, they've taken each other on pound for pound.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, they built franchise after franchise throughout the world. Burger King's signature burger, the Whopper, sizzled onto its menu in 1957. McDonald's fired off its Big Mac in 1968. And the crispy, salty fries, well, they have been perfected over the years. Customers have flocked to these rivals, partly because of all the choices and the convenience, but they also haven't had to empty out their pockets to eat there.</p><p>The country's attachment to fast food didn't go unnoticed. By the 1990s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Subway were eating into these rivals' marketshare. And not much later, national obesity and nutrition concerns became prominent.</p><p>So these days, Burger King and McDonald's have expanded into healthy foods and even list the calories on their menus in some states and cities. Believe it or not, Burger King now offers veggie burgers and kids' meals. McDonald's now includes salads and chicken sandwiches.</p><p>Whether you have a beef with the burgers or you take a bite out of them, deciding to own a franchise might be found in the numbers. If you owned a Burger King franchise in 2004, your sales could have reached $1 million. And in 2007, sales could have risen to $1.2 million. A McDonald's franchise in 2004 could have earned you $1.6 million in sales, and three years later you could have brought in $1.9 million.</p><p>Would you buys a franchise today?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. So, for more on these burger wars, we're going to send it over to Alexis.</p><p>And to do so, I'm going to be back here, Alexis, in just a moment with some news out of Apple, because Steve Jobs has just sent a letter out, which he says, among other things, that he's been losing weight throughout 2008, but the reason has been a mystery to him and his doctors. We'll look through that and get some more details in just a moment.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. No, I'm just seeing this press release coming out from the board of directors.</p><p>Great point there, Connell. We'll cover that breaking news story in just a moment.</p><p>But let's finish up on the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King. I think I'm a fairly good expert on this.</p><p>I'm joined by Sheri Daye Scott, editor-in-chief for \"QSR\" magazine, and Steve West, the vice president of equity research for restaurants for Stifel Nicolaus.</p><p>Good morning, guys.</p><p>Sherri, let me start with you.</p><p>Burger King and McDonald's, it's a rivalry that has been legendary. Where does it stand right now?</p><p>SHERRI DAYE SCOTT, \"QSR\" MAGAZINE: Well, you know, McDonald's is number one. They've been number one for a long, long time. But Burger King has kind of carved its own niche into the market, and they're doing well in that niche.</p><p>The two are playing in different markets. McDonald's is focusing on mom and kids, and Burger King is focusing on those young edgy guys. And both are number one in those markets.</p><p>GLICK: And so I imagine, Steve, that each of the two, Burger King and McDonald's, they've figured out how to remain competitors in a marketplace that they feel has enough room for each of them to be the dominant players.</p><p>STEVE WEST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Yes, that's exactly right. They've both, over the last several years, have really evolved their menus to ad, as we mentioned before, healthier type options.</p><p>Now, is it healthy food? I wouldn't go that far. But when you can go to McDonald's and get grilled chicken sandwiches, salad, you can go to Burger King and get -- they call them apple fries, basically sliced apples, Mac and cheese for the kids, they are focusing on healthy items, they are focusing on premium items. That helps drive those sales at the franchisees that you mentioned earlier. So things are doing very well.</p><p>And when we think about the consumer here in the U.S., we typically spend almost half of our food dollars every year at restaurants. That trend hasn't changed that much over the last couple of years, even in these recessionary times that we're in.</p><p>What we're seeing is people are trading down to fast food because of the value, because of the convenience. It's definitely a win-win for McDonald's and Burger King right now.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and it's been reflected in their stock price even while this recession, many suggest, began in the fourth quarter of last year.</p><p>Sherri, let me turn to you, because their marketing strategies are very, very different. I mean, Burger King has this virgin Whopper thing going on right now.</p><p>How is it that they are a reflection of the company and who they are and who they're trying to target?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, you know, to the point about what I mentioned earlier, the two different marketing groups, Burger King realized McDonald's is going to own those mom and kids, so about four or five years ago, they went after the younger, more edgier crowd. And Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky out in Miami is really leading that charge.</p><p>What they're doing is they're making people talk about Burger King. The Whopper, the virgin Whopper campaign, it's making people talk about their preferences.</p><p>Do you like the burger? Do you like the Whopper? Do you prefer the Big Mac?</p><p>Burger king has done a great job of just getting their name out into the public, getting people to talk about Burger King, whether it's subservient (ph) chicken campaign they did a few years ago where they had the dancing chicken, whether it's the king in those kind of edgy and somewhat creepy ads to people. People are talking about Burger King in a way they probably weren't five or six years ago.</p><p>GLICK: So, Steve, you know, in the midst of this serious economic downturn, each company is trying to do the right thing to differentiate themselves in the international environment, in addition to the domestic.</p><p>What are they trying to do to make sure that those marketshare numbers continue to grow as not just the U.S. economy faces recession, but the global economy faces a recession?</p><p>WEST: Well, they're doing really a lot of the same things. If you look at what McDonald's -- and I call it the McDonald's playbook, you know, when they came out with their plan to win in 2003, really focusing on the stores, making sure the stores looked nice, focusing on store level execution, and getting that menu right, making it \"relevant,\" they're doing the same thing in Europe.</p><p>They're remodeling stores. They shut down a lot of older, dirty looking stores. They're making the menu relevant. You know, instead of just taking a cookie cutter U.S. menu and applying it to Europe, as they used to do, and the rest around the world, they're also making them -- they're customizing the burgers and the chicken and the things like that with local flare.</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>WEST: And that makes it relevant. And they're also offering value. So they're really doing the same things around the world that they have been in the U.S., and it's been very successful, even in these downturns that we're seeing in Europe and Asia.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. Well, Sherri and Steve, we're going to leave it there. There's nothing more exciting than talking about the hamburger war at McDonald's and Burger King.</p><p>Thank you, guys. I'm starving now. I'm like ready to go get some fast food.</p><p>Thank you guys very much.</p><p>Well, we do have some breaking news surrounding the health of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. I want to go back to Connell. Connell has been following this story for us.</p><p>And Connell, I understand there is a statement coming out of the board of directors as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Two things here.</p><p>One is a letter being sent out by Steve Jobs. We talked before you started that segment about the fact that he acknowledges the weight loss issues that we've all seen when Steve Jobs has appeared in public within the last year.</p><p>He says that he has been losing weight. And up until now, or up until recently, that weight loss had been a mystery to him. But now going over some of the reasons in this letter that he has written, says the doctors think they found the reason for it, and they expect it will take him until late spring to regain the weight and body mass.</p><p>Now, that reason, according to Steve Jobs and his doctors, is this -- he says that they cite a hormone imbalance that has been, to quote from his letter, \"... robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy.\" So, again, Steve Jobs saying his doctor says he has a hormone imbalance and that is the reason he's been losing weight. And they think that he can put this weight back on, and he will continue as apple's CEO during his recovery.</p><p>He says the remedy for nutritional problems is a simple one and it's straightforward. And they've already begun the treatment for it.</p><p>So on this news, it looks like the Apple stock is actually jumping up a little bit in premarket trading. We'll continue to follow that particular angle of it.</p><p>Now, you mentioned that the board of directors had put out a statement as well. They say, \"It's widely recognized both inside and outside of Apple that Steve Jobs, one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the world...\" And they go over what they said in the past.</p><p>They said if it ever comes to a day when Steve wants to retire, or for other reasons can't continue as the CEO, you will know it. That is basically the answer that they've given us in the past.</p><p>But again, Steve Jobs acknowledging the weight loss that he has had. As you see here in some of this video in which he face had looked drawn, a lot of people had talked about that the last time he had appeared on stage. And now saying it's because, Alexis, of a hormone imbalance and he is taking treatment for that.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Connell, thank you very much for bringing us up to date on that.</p><p>We of course are going to continue to discuss it right now, because we're going to switch gears here. Richard Suttmeier is with me, and Charles Payne is here with me to talk more about what the implications might be here for Apple.</p><p>You know, Charles, people have been saying for at least a year now that they've got to come up with a succession plan. Now, at least, we have some sense as to what the illness that's affecting the man behind Apple. But will there be greater calls perhaps to have him do what Bill Gates did at Microsoft, assume the chairman role and perhaps look for a future successor in the CEO role?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think the street would like to know who the successor might be, but I don't think anyone would like to see Steve Jobs step down if he's capable of doing both jobs right now. He is obviously the heart and soul of the company. That's why he's so important.</p><p>You don't talk about any other individual in the company there or associated with in this market more than Steve Jobs and Apple. So this is good news. The stock obviously indicating a little bit higher.</p><p>There's still going to be some rumblings, though. A lot of folks are saying, listen, you know, he suffered from pancreatic cancer. That is typically a pretty deadly disease. And until this is totally resolved, we see him put on weight, people are going to speculate.</p><p>GLICK: Richard?</p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM: Well, I'm going to take it from the standpoint of what Value Engine describes Apple computer. It seems like when it gets to an $85 handle, it becomes a buy-rated stock. When it gets into the s$90, it becomes a hold-rated stock.</p><p>So this morning, from a trading perspective, I'm going to see how many times this year I can make that same five to seven points. So my subscribers...</p><p>GLICK: So it's range bound though.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: It's range bound. And so I'm going to use this strength to, say, book profits on a buy-rated stock that's now a hold.</p><p>PAYNE: That's right, because our subscribers are in the stock, too, on an average of about 86 bucks. And I'm going to grapple with that as well because, technically, it doesn't have a lot of resistance between here and R100, but it comes down fairly quickly when it stops moving.</p><p>GLICK: How much, guys -- I don't want to say is the bloom off the rose? Because this is considered the darling in the tech world. But in terms of new innovation and new products? Or is that just because, as my husband said to me yesterday, we have Mac computers all over our house and you just don't need to upgrade them as often because the fact of the matter is, they're built terrific, they do the right things, and so you don't have to upgrade them very often?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, it's interesting you brought up Mac computers, because everyone has talked about the halo effect from iPhones and iPods, and how that would introduce audiences to the Mac computer. People are looking at this MacWorld Conference for something on the Mac PC. That's what they want to see, because they're doing exceptionally well in all other areas in the business.</p><p>We should also remind the audience, a pretty upbeat article in Barron's over the weekend on Apple. And this morning, (INAUDIBLE) Brothers also had positive comments on them. So the street and analysts liking what they're seeing.</p><p>GLICK: But Jobs isn't, as I -- right? He's not doing the presentation, or whatever, right?</p><p>PAYNE: He's not. He's not going to be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: And that's the first time. So some are going to suspect that if he is not doing it, it's because either they're not excited about it or perhaps that's why they put this release out today, is because he's now being treated.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Well, I would agree with that. He's being treated, and hopefully the man gets well again and comes back out in six months with the weight back on and announces another nano-nano, small-small device.</p><p>PAYNE: But by the same token, you do at some point want other people in the company to be associated with good news.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: So hopefully whoever does make the presentation will say, \"Hey, look at this.\" And everyone will say, \"Wow!\" so that we're excited about hearing from other folks. You know, any corporation, though, if the CEO is scheduled to speak and doesn't speak, the stock is going to get slaughtered.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean, that's the thing that concerns me here, is that, you know, we've talked about this with the Warren Buffett situation as well, when you desire as a shareholder some kind of succession plan.</p><p>It doesn't mean it has to be put in place. I mean, look, Wal-Mart decided to do it at a time that some suggest, wow, why would you do it now? But at least something. And I guess maybe we can read into who they select to do the presentation.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I mean, now it's \"Wow, but I can't afford it\" from the consumer standpoint. Let's see if I get my tax return. I get a tax refund, maybe a \"wow\" product, I'll spend it on that.</p><p>GLICK: Except that they made this great deal with Wal-Mart, right, where they're selling their devices. So that's -- you know, everybody seems to be moving in that direction.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Everyone was pretty excited about it. They seem to be doing -- firing on all cylinders right now outside of the health issue with Steve Jobs.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We're going to leave it there.</p><p>Richard and Charles, thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>Let's go to Ashley Webster in London and get a check and update on what is going on in the overseas markets. And he's also going to bring us up to date on what is happening with Woolworths.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Thank you, Alexis. That's the big story.</p><p>Tomorrow, the 600 remaining Woolworth stores will close in the United Kingdom, bringing to a close an era of retail discounting. Really, they really were the original Wal-Marts, as one much my guests just referred to it. We'll get to that in a minute.</p><p>Now, the U.S. stores that, of course, become synonymous with American retail, the Woolworth stores in the United States even played a role in the civil rights movement. They began closing their doors though in the U.S. some 29 years ago, converting in many cases to a new store, the Foot Locker. We'll explain how that happened as well.</p><p>So for more on Woolworths' international legacy, I am joined by Sam Poser, who is vice president and senior researcher analyst for Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach. And also joining me here in studio, Allyson Stewart-Allen, who is director of International Marketing Partners.</p><p>And Allyson, I'll begin with you.</p><p>This really is the end of an era, isn't it? But you would have thought that someone like Woolworths were better prepared to handle an economic downturn than many other stores.</p><p>ALLYSON STEWART-ALLEN, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PARTNERS: Yes, you would have thought so. And the thing that's fairly emotional for a lot of British people about the closure of Woolworths here is the fact that it's a store format that was quite innovative in its time.</p><p>You know, the five and dime was something that in the U.K. was beforehand not known. You know, this time, with the Woolworths, you can go in, you can choose what you want, it's very discount-oriented and invented the discount category of retailing in the U.K. So oddly enough, the fact that it invented this category here, and now this innovator is no longer...</p><p>WEBSTER: So what went wrong? That's the question.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Well, that's a really good point. What usually goes wrong with retailers of al kinds, and in particular Woolworths, is the fact that they didn't really keep up with who their customer was.</p><p>So they changed their categories, they didn't merchandise very well. They didn't have the depth of ranges that their customers expected.</p><p>The in-store experience became increasingly bleak as all of those around them upgraded their offerings. So they didn't keep up with the trends, they didn't keep up with the in-store environment. They didn't keep up with the merchandise. And all of that is a recipe for total disaster.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sam, let's go to you.</p><p>Woolworth closed its stores in the 1980s and '90s, closing the door on the final stores in 1997. So it's been some 11 years in the U.S.</p><p>How did this brand evolve into Foot Locker? How did that come about?</p><p>SAM POSER, VICE PRESIDENT, STERNE, AGEE &amp; LEACH: Well, the last Woolworth store closed -- Woolworth divested to Europe in 1982, and the last Woolworth store closed in 1997. It was just the evolution of the business at the Woolworth Corporation, now Foot Locker Corporation, into an athletic specialty business.</p><p>And as that business became the dominant factor overall, Foot Locker spun off the various businesses that didn't work quite as well for them. And now it's evolved into the world's largest athletic specialty retail chain.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. And Sam, given the current economy, how is Foot Locker performing?</p><p>POSER: Well, Foot Locker's sales have been sort of stagnant over the last few years, but they've begun to manage their businesses significantly better than they have in the past. The stock to sales ratio, inventory levels and so on, have improved dramatically this year. Basically, the best ratio in about five years.</p><p>We expect earnings to -- we're not looking for much earnings growth in the next year or so, but we do see -- due to reduced top line. However, we do see the efficiencies improving dramatically and then beginning to take more share. They faced some problems recently because the athletic footwear trend has been soft, but that's improving now.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Well, Sam and Allyson, I just want to ask you, very quickly, five seconds, what kind of legacy does Woolworths leave behind?</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Interestingly, the granddaughter of Mr. Woolworth, Barbara Hutton, had a house built in Regents Park called Winfield House.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: And that is now the home of the American ambassador. So you can close the high street stores, but they're still here in another form.</p><p>WEBSTER: The legacy lives on.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: It does.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right.</p><p>Sam Poser, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Allyson Stewart-Allen -- I want to call you Allyson Stewart-Allyson. I just like the word Allyson.</p><p>Thank you very much, anyway, for being here.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. When we come back, \"The One Thing You Should Know.\" So don't go away.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. Now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>We get started with Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>Ashley, what do you have for us?</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, let me tell you, Alexis. Today is somewhat of a sad and interesting day. And I'll tell you why.</p><p>It's the number one day for divorces to be filed. In fact, this is the busiest week of the year, and this is the busiest day of the busiest week. And you know why? Because the stress of the holidays is the final straw that broke the camel's back, and today is divorce day. So it's not very encouraging, but somewhat interesting.</p><p>GLICK: That is very sad. How do you know that, Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. I know. Sorry.</p><p>GLICK: That's not good.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sorry.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: It's sad, but I'm impressed how fast it happens. You know what? \"What did you buy? Oh, no!\"</p><p>GLICK: Yes. \"How much money did you spend? You're out!\"</p><p>All right, Jenna, what is your one thing?</p><p>LEE: Well, the one thing is this Apple story. I think this is the biggest story of the day. We had the stimulus plan, you had the auto sales, but really how investors take in what is going on with Steve Jobs, I think that's going to be the most interesting story to watch today, for sure.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. And his letter to shareholders was very passionate, very forthright. We're going to do more of that letter coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" but we'll show you it. But it was pretty incredible.</p><p>PAYNE: It is. And, you know, he's just one of these incredible guys whose story everyone knows, and a Horatio Alger-type story.</p><p>But I think, also, this stimulus thing with <person><nameText>President-elect Obama, </nameText></person>the notion of making tax cuts such an important part of this, just may be a very brilliant move. Gold has gone down a lot, the dollar is beginning to rally. I think international markets like the news, and I think a lot of conservative investors in America like the news as well.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. It's going to change the ballgame.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: I think it is.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, he's taken bits from all -- he's taken bits from FDR, Eisenhower and Reagan. And...</p><p>GLICK: I can't wait to see this report that you're writing.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. It's coming out great. It's coming out great. A lot of work though. I always bite off more than I can chew.</p><p>GLICK: I'm so excited. We're going to dedicate a lot of time to that, because he's writing this really in-depth report about the first 100 days for each of those presidents.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And those are the three guys, I think, three presidents that I think are going to be very important, their game plans and how successful they were.</p><p>GLICK: All right. I look forward to it.</p><p>All right, guys. Well, before we go, we want to welcome San Diego, Cox Communications in San Diego.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>PAYNE: Whoa -- San Diego, too? So we've got Connecticut, San Diego and Vegas.</p><p>GLICK: We've got -- yes, right? We've got Vegas, we have San Diego, and we have Hartford, Connecticut.</p><p>Welcome, guys. We're so excited to have you guys.</p><p>All right. Stay with us. \"THE OPENING BELL\" is coming up next.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2009 Fox News Network, LLC.

We're going to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p>And it may be too early for a hamburger, but we'll take a look at the rivalry between burger giants, Burger King and McDonald's.</p><p>Today is Monday, January 5th, 2009. \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right now.</p><p>Good morning. And welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" Happy New Year everyone, I'm Alexis Glick. Back in the seat and ready to go.</p><p>Well, we're going to get the latest on <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson's</nameText></person> stepping away from his job as Secretary of Commerce in just a moment.</p><p>And the Madoff hearings begin today. The House Financial Services Committee will probe how it is that the SEC missed the scheme. We're going to go live to Washington, D.C.</p><p>And what will 2009 look like for trading? We get hopefully off to a good start; at least so far. We'll continue to see whether or not that will work through.</p><p>And why would anyone want to start a new football league in this economy? We're going to find out.</p><p>But first take a quick look at the U.S. futures this morning as right now we're down 16 points; 8,942. The S&amp;P right now down 1.60. The NASDAQ down 2.75, but we had climbed above that 9,000 mark just late last week which we hadn't been to since early November, we'll see whether or not it shapes up to be a good year.</p><p>Well, let's get things started this morning with the three things you should know.</p><p>President-elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and Congressional Democrats meeting today are looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and businesses. This is an attempt to gain Republican support for his more than $700 billion economic stimulus package.</p><p>And French President, Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with Israeli and Palestinian authority leaders. Now, the president is there in an attempt to push for a cease-fire in of course, the war-torn Gaza area.</p><p>On the ground this morning Israel struck at new Hamas targets in Gaza as it tries to rein in rocket attacks by the terrorist group.</p><p>And Microsoft's dominance on the Internet, well it may be waning. The software giant saw the share of its Internet browser Explorer drop from 74 down to 68 percent last month. Making the biggest inroads -- Mozilla Firefox which landed 21 percent of the market share.</p><p>All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p>Now, for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets, we go to Ashley Webster in London. Good morning Ashley and happy New Year.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: And happy New Year to you too Alexis, and welcome back. Good morning everybody.</p><p>We're off to a positive start and certainly in Asia overnight and so far in Europe we are also moving higher although not exactly setting the world on fire, but we are higher, and that's good.</p><p>London Exchange, the FTSE 100 up about a quarter of a percent, just a little more than eight percent. On the CAC-40 in Paris also higher by about a tenth of a percent. And on the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up about a third of a percent.</p><p>Another iconic company falling victim to the credit crunch we find out this morning Waterford Wedgewood, now this is a company announcing today that it's calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection. The Irish group best known for Wedgewood Pottery, Royal Dalton and Waterford Crystal collapsed after talks over possible investment in this business failed. It has officially called in the administrators.</p><p>Meantime European automakers say they are taking aim at Detroit they've said this before and failed. Will it work this time? Well, Volkswagen and BMW of Germany are gearing up to expand market share in the U.S. in the next few years. VW, investing in, in its first U.S. factory in two decades and expects to triple U.S. sales to one million vehicles by 2018; BMW meanwhile, introducing a new small car and expanding its distribution network. We'll see how this works out.</p><p>Now, let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>MCSHANE: Hey, good morning, Ashley and thanks a lot.</p><p>We are keeping an eye on these U.S. automakers today; certainly the big three from Detroit releasing their sales figures for December and the rest of 2008 later on today. And the numbers are expected to be pretty dismal with American carmakers selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08; if that's the case it would be the biggest drop since 1974.</p><p>When it comes to our foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW are actually speeding towards an expansion in their stateside market according to a report in \"Wall Street Journal\" this morning. So that's an interesting kind of twist in things.</p><p>And this week also kicks off two pretty big tech shows. Apple is set to unveil some new products today and tomorrow when Mac World kicks off in San Francisco. Investors will be looking into new gadgets as well as any kind of insight at all into the health of the CEO, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>who has just become an issue of late. Jobs not expected to attend the MAC World this year.</p><p>And on Wednesday night it should be pointed out the Consumer Electronic Show begins out of Las Vegas. I'll be there to cover the latest new products later on in the week from CES.</p><p>Now, Pfizer is another one we're watching today, it's weighing a merger deal with a rival drug company or it would weigh one. The Financial Times reporting the CEO Jeff Kindler says the world's largest pharmaceutical company is quote, \"open to opportunities and constantly looking at those which are big, small and in between.\" Pfizer's stock price, well, we have it is up behind you there 18.27 a share at the close; it's down almost 20 percent over that one year time span.</p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning. Alexis, back over to you Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right Connell, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, New Mexico<person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson </nameText></person>will not be joining the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>as Commerce Secretary. Richardson pulled out yesterday citing an ongoing federal investigation into a state contract awarded to one of his political donors.</p><p>With more on this story we're joined by Michael Coleman the Washington, D.C. Bureau Chief for the \"Albuquerque Journal\" which has been covering the investigation for some time and Joe Monahan a New Mexico political veteran, who now writes a blog about state politics.</p><p>Michael let me start with you. Your newspaper reported on the investigation back in August. Apparently it has been on the docket now for many months.</p><p>What type of relationship is it that <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson </nameText></person>has with this financial company known as CDR Financial?</p><p>MICHAEL COLEMAN, ALBUQUERQUE JOURNAL D.C. BUREAU CHIEF: Well, their owner David Rubin had contributed about $100,000 to a couple of Governor Richardson's political action committees. And right around the same time that these donations were made the New Mexico Finance Authority, which is a quasi governmental agency with board members appointed by Governor Richardson, awarded this company a couple of contracts to help with some really complicated financial transactions, bond sales, bond swaps, et cetera.</p><p>One of those contracts was a no bid contract. And another one of those contracts CDR had issued -- had submitted the RFP but they weren't the top bidder, they weren't the top scored bidder on that but they still got the job.</p><p>GLICK: So in other words, as I understand it, they were the second in line of the bidders for the contracts so their suggestion here is this a pay for play scandal. On the other hand, <person><nameText>Governor Bill Richardson's</nameText></person> team says, we did absolutely everything right. In fact, the contract that we did with CDR Financial worked out to have some really important profitability for the state of New Mexico.</p><p>Tell me about that.</p><p>COLEMAN: Right. Now, they are very adamant about the fact that CDR saved the state a significant amount of money. And these bond swaps, these complicated transactions that CDR specializes in was not part of the original request for proposal.</p><p>But apparently New Mexico Finance Authority gave them points for that nevertheless. And it turns out they did one of those swaps. The only bond swap in New Mexico history apparently. And Governor Richardson and his team do say that that saved the state a lot of money.</p><p>GLICK: Joe, walk me through the normal type situation here because as I understand it, that there is a process for bidding out contracts like this, but this one appears as though it was done sort of quietly.</p><p>Tell me why that adds even more speculation to the story.</p><p>JOE MONAHAN, NEW MEXICO POLITICAL BLOGGER (ON THE PHONE): Well, there's really no reason that we know why that the paperwork is not on file with the state for this contract. I know Michael's newspaper has reported on that. And that's one of the aspects of the investigation, just how this deal was transpired.</p><p>The governor has run into problems down here before with contracts and campaign contributions. He's had to return campaign contributions several times after the press has reported that the campaign contributor was given a state contract.</p><p>So this pay-to-play situation has haunted Richardson somewhat, but not to the scale that it has now because it obviously is a national story.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Michael the $64,000 question that everybody is waking up with this morning is they are wondering how it is if you have been investigating this in your newspaper now, dating back to August, how it is that the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>didn't know that this could be an issue in terms of his ability to take over this cabinet seat.</p><p>I mean what's the back end story here?</p><p>COLEMAN: Yes, that is the $64,000 question today. I think as you said, we had reported this back in August. I talked to members of the Senate Commerce Committee in December and did a story. And they said they were aware of this.</p><p>You know, my hunch is that maybe they weren't aware of the extent to which the FBI was looking into this. I'm not sure exactly how the conversations went between Governor Richardson's and Obama's transition team. There was some indications yesterday and some reports that maybe Governor Richardson wasn't as forthcoming as they would have liked.</p><p>Richardson spokesperson denied that to us yesterday and said he was were very forthcoming. So maybe some of this will play out in the next 24 to 48 hours. We'll see.</p><p>GLICK: Joe, how does this play in New Mexico, I understand he has some of the greatest ratings -- favorability ratings as a governor there. And could, if this investigation is put behind him, could he actually wind up in another cabinet seat at one point?</p><p>MONAHAN: Well, I think this has really hurt Richardson with Obama. He's not going to be hurt much in New Mexico. He is a well liked governor. He was re-elected with a record amount of vote. But Richardson has taken a major hit nationally on this. The cabinet positions are going to be filled.</p><p>Also Ken Salazar is now the Department Interior Secretary designate; that is an important Hispanic appointment that Obama has made so it puts less heat on the administration when it comes to the ethnic aspect of this.</p><p>GLICK: All right, well, Michael and Joe, we'll leave it at that. Of course, we'll continue to follow this story. Thank you gentlemen, very much.</p><p>COLEMAN: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: Well, the House Financial Services Committee begins an open session this afternoon. They're exploring <person><nameText>Bernard Madoff's</nameText></person> alleged $50 billion Ponzi scheme.</p><p>The Securities and Exchange Commission's Inspector General could get a cool reception after \"Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years.</p><p>Here for a preview of the House session, we're joined by Scott Garrett, he's the Republican Representative of New Jersey who is a member of the House Financial Services Committee and Harvey Pitt, former SEC Chairman and Kalorama Partners CEO.</p><p>Gentlemen, good to see you.</p><p>Harvey, let me start with you. \"Wall Street Journal\" reporting as we just talked about the number of investigations over the past eight years; pretty staggering statistics. What does this say about their failure to do the job?</p><p>HARVEY PITT, FORMER SEC CHAIRMAN: Well, I think it reflects something we've all thought might have occurred here, and that is the potential for human failure.</p><p>There appears to have been a fair amount of warning to the SEC, and it appears that when people looked into these issues, they came away without concluding that anything wrong was going on.</p><p>I do think it's important to remember that this was a deliberate fraud, and that Madoff was keeping a couple of sets of books.</p><p>GLICK: So all right let me come back to that in just a second, Harvey.</p><p>Congressman Garrett, let me go to you, because I understand one of your colleagues is running this, Congressman Kanjorski. And the real story here is he wants to figure out how did this situation occur in the first place? Was this a lack of proper oversight, and what kind of regulatory reform might it lead to?</p><p>Do you worry that it's going to lead to even more regulatory oversight than we already have?</p><p>REP. SCOTT GARRETT, (R) NEW JERSEY: Oh, we always have to worry about that whenever the government is involved, there's always -- what is the term -- a knee-jerk reaction to a crisis. A crisis as it were; obviously this is a problem whether you are a large investor or middle-sized investor, a private investor or small investor; a lot of people were significantly hurt in this situation.</p><p>Now, to his credit, the Congressman Kanjorski made the comment I think earlier this morning that there obviously is responsibility also on the part of the investor in this situation.</p><p>That each investor has to make, you know, their own due diligence, if you will, when they make their investments. So you have to look at both sides of the equation.</p><p>But back to your initial question, we have to be concerned whether government comes back with a knee-jerk reaction with saying we're going to give more authority, more power, more money into the very same agency that was responsible and failed on the job.</p><p>GLICK: So Congressman, as I understand it, the SEC's Chief, you know, chief risk officer, their inspector is going to appear today in front of Congress.</p><p>GARRETT: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: The number one whistle-blower though in this was originally scheduled to appear and is now not appearing. What do you hope to get out of it, and why the change in the lineup?</p><p>GARRETT: I can't give you an answer on the change in the lineup. Obviously there are questions that we would like to have put there, say, what did you know before and why hasn't the information come forth through all the investigations that the SEC has made?</p><p>The other aspect of this as well as far as the outcome of the equation, we'll have all these investigations. We'll get all the information we possibly can, but at the bottom line, where the government is not like the private sector. The private sector is such that if this occurred in the private sector, where business failed to do what they were responsible for doing, whether it's manufacturing something, or making something or turning a profit, that business at the end of the day would be out of business.</p><p>But when government is involved, the normal reaction to it is to do just the opposite. Throw more money, put more regulation on in place, and we saw that with the Enron situation and Sarbanes-Oxley. We came back with so much more regulation in place, that it actually was a detriment to business going forward --</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>GARRETT: -- as opposed to a benefit to them.</p><p>GLICK: Harvey, let me go back to you because one of the things you touched on as you answered my first question is the fact of the matter is we now understand there have been offshore accounts. There may be many offshore accounts.</p><p>What would the SEC know or not know in that situation? I mean, you know, look, people are going to think this is egregious in how the SEC missed this but are you telling me that because there might have been offshore accounts, there could have been loopholes or opportunities for the SEC to miss it?</p><p>PITT: Well, the SEC has had a lot of experience in dealing with offshore accounts. Obviously there's bank secrecy and problems with getting all that information, but the critical function here was to go in and examine Madoff's operations, his books and records.</p><p>And I believe picking up on something the Congressman said, that it's physically impossible for any agency of government to do what we are expecting them to do. That doesn't excuse this particular situation.</p><p>But there are 11,000 registered investment advisors, and the SEC has 3,700 people on its staff. There's no way the SEC can continuously review these people. And so what's required is a whole new paradigm for dealing with inspection and examinations, and it has to be done quickly.</p><p>GLICK: You know, I don't know if you got a chance, Harvey, to see an article in the New York Times, the Sunday New York Times yesterday, an opinion article written about what needs to change at the SEC. But one of the key things that is talked about in this article is whether or not there's just too close a relationship between Wall Street and the role of the top risk officer, top inspectors at the SEC who exchange jobs between becoming a chief risk officer at the Wall Street firm and the SEC.</p><p>How do we make sure that we learn some valuable lessons here and that we don't allow something like this which involved this many investigations to go unnoticed?</p><p>PITT: Well, I think what you have to do is change the entire structure of examinations. That's what's the problem. You can't take some kids right out of college who are being paid $50,000 or $60,000 a year and ask them to examine $50 billion hedge funds.</p><p>What you need to do is have a completely different system, one that we proposed back in 2003 but which hasn't yet been adopted, and I think would solve a lot of this problem.</p><p>The SEC has to do a much better job of setting the standards and requiring independent examinations with reports both to the firm reviewed and the SEC, and then the SEC's personnel can go in and look at the issues that have been uncovered.</p><p>I think otherwise we're going to be just setting the SEC up for failure --</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>PITT: -- on a continuing basis.</p><p>GLICK: All right gentlemen, we're going to leave it there. I know this is going to a hot topic, Congressman Garrett, Harvey Pitt, as always great pleasure seeing the two of you.</p><p>All right guys, coming up we're going to go live to the Gaza Strip with the latest on Israel's ground assault and escalating tensions in the Gaza area.</p><p>And this latest Mideast conflict has oil experts worried. We're going to tell you why in just a couple moments. Stay with us.</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back.</p><p>Well the fighting in Gaza continues. Israeli troops on the ground pushing deeper into the region. Dominic Waghorn of Sky News is live at the Gaza- Israeli border with the very latest. Dominic, good morning. Bring us to up-to-date on the very latest.</p><p>DOMIC WAGHORN, SKY NEWS: well, the fighting is continuing in Gaza. The ground force operation continues on three fronts. The Israelis have been fighting with Hamas in the south. They are targeting the smuggling tunnels there that Hamas have used to smuggle in weapons from Egypt. They have been hit with aerial bombardments and the Israeli forces are now on the ground fighting Hamas there. An armored column, a big armored column of somewhere between 100 and 150 tanks -- and armored personnel carriers has pushed right the way through the sea and is occupying land that effectively splits Gaza in two.</p><p>That means Gaza city which you will be able to see behind me if it wasn't for the haze is now encircled by Israeli forces. The fiercest fighting though, I think, has been in the area behind me. That's the north most bit of Gaza around the refugee camp of Jibalia (ph) and the town of Bethleher (ph). The reports are very close to fighting, house to house combat. According to one reports, hand-to-hand fighting in tunnels underneath those houses where an Israeli soldier was nearly abducted but was able to escape. There's no letup in the pace of this action.</p><p>GLICK: Dominic, talk to me about the humanitarian costs of all of this. I know the French president Nicolas Sarkozy is supposed to travel there today. What are the implications here?</p><p>WAGHORN: yeah, the Americans have stood full square behind the Israelis on this not critical of it but the British governments and the French have been critical of this ground invasion. And the main reason for that and the mounting concern is this humanitarian crisis and the mounting civilian death toll.</p><p>Around 500, over 500 people have been killed by this in Gaza. And we don't know how many of them are civilians, but we think at least a quarter of them, many of them women and children. There were reports today of three children being killed in a house, for instance, near that armored column with one tank shell. Another artillery shell wiped out a family of seven to the north of Gaza city.</p><p>The death toll yesterday was 40 and halfway through the day we're heading towards that number again today. The Israelis though say they have no alternative but to carry out this operation. What they are not saying is how much longer it will go on for.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Dominic, we will leave it there. Thank you very much for bringing us up-to-date on the very latest. Of course be safe. Now let's send it over to Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Thanks a lot, Alexis.</p><p>Well as the ten day assault escalates the price of oil continues to tick upwards; right now crude trading around $46. It had approached $47 earlier as some Islamic countries say that oil should be used as a weapon.</p><p>With a closer look at how the conflict is affecting oil, I'm joined by Phil Flynn, Fox Business contributor, vice president and senior market analyst for financial firm Alaron Trading.</p><p>Phil, the first question, Israeli troops are now on the ground in Gaza. Can we expect this to continue to move the price of crude oil higher?</p><p>PHIL FLYNN, ALARON TRADING: Not necessarily to be honest with you. I think this is an emotional reaction to the market. I don't think anybody really believes that OPEC or other oil-producing countries are going to use oil as a weapon in this situation. But there is no doubt that psychologically on light volume it did drive this market higher. I don't think it's sustainable.</p><p>PAYNE: Having said that, do you think that -- looks like earlier today we saw $47, it is pulling back a little bit, is there a ceiling right now that oil can go to? I mean it's made a huge move off of $33.</p><p>FLYNN: It really has. We're talking in three days on light volume. And really what started this move was the news out of Russia and the Ukraine. So this is really I don't think geopolitical driven at all. I think it's more optimism about the new year.</p><p>Really what drove the market was this incredible start to the year that we had with the stock market turning around, so I think we're seeing a mood change in the market somewhat. For oil to technically confirm that this is a reversal will have to close above $50 a barrel, but I think that's going to be a tough job today unless the stock market performs magnificently.</p><p>PAYNE: Phil, we have talked about these geopolitical events.</p><p>Let's talk about the stimulus package here. What impact is the Obama stimulus plan having on oil and what will it do for oil as the year goes on?</p><p>FLYNN: I think in the short-term it's creating little bit of optimism, and if you get optimism, that can turn the market around a little bit. And it's amazing how quickly it's changed. I mean, if you look back at just, you know, New Year's Eve, oil prices were at $33. It was doom and gloom. All of a sudden, boom, we're starting to feel optimistic again and that, in and of itself, can turn oil around.</p><p>PAYNE: All right. Well thanks a lot Phil. Really appreciate your time this morning.</p><p>FLYNN: Thank you.</p><p>PAYNE: Coming up, we're about almost two hours away from the first full trading week of the new year getting underway. We will see if the Dow's rally on Friday can continue; 258 points, that was a big one. Looking for an encore.</p><p>More \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" when we return.</p><p>WEBSTER: Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I'm Ashley Webster in London keeping an eye on overseas trading on this the first full week of trading in 2009.</p><p>So far so good; we've seen generally a positive day of trading in Asia overnight. And so far in Europe we're in the green, although not with a lot of conviction, it has to be said. We're up about 7 points on the FTSE 100. Essentially flat now in Paris on the cac-40. Up about a quarter percent in Germany on the Dax 30.</p><p>News today of another iconic business that's fallen victim to the credit crunch. Waterford Wedgewood announced today that it is calling in the administrators for bankruptcy protection. The group best known for Wedgewood pottery and Royal Dalton of Waterford Crystal collapsing after talks over a possible investment in the business failed. This Irish business dates back to 1759 -- a sad day.</p><p>Meantime, in the oil business, Saudi Arabia may well be laying the groundwork for a sizable reduction in crude oil shipments. Many members of OPEC just seem reluctant to commit to the group's pledge to cut output. So Saudi Arabia likely to take the lead in acting to shore up sagging oil prices.</p><p>Crude prices by the way are higher today. That is giving a boost to the oil stocks, but even here we're being a little mixed. BP up one and a half percent in London, but Royal Dutch shell down two percent.</p><p>We've also seen money coming out of gold, down 17 percent in London -- $17 that is per ounce in London trading.</p><p>Mining stocks doing okay but turning rather mixed as well. Rio Tinto up one and a third percent. Xstrata, another big mining company up three and a half percent. But you know what, the U.S. dollar, stronger this morning; up against both the euro and the British pound that means the pound now at $1.45.</p><p>That's the very latest from European trading. Now let's go back to New York for the latest headlines with Jenna Lee -- Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thank you very much, Ashley. Good morning once again everyone.</p><p>It could be a showdown on Capitol Hill. <person><nameText>Roland Burris </nameText></person>is headed to Washington today and plans to be sworn in as the junior senator from Illinois along with the rest of the new senators which happens tomorrow. But Democratic leaders have said they won't allow Burris on the senate floor.</p><p>He was appointed of course by tainted Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich who is accused of trying to sell the seat; the seat that he is supposed to take over to the highest bidder. Burris says his appointment is perfectly legal and denying him entry to the senate would be denying the people of Illinois their rightful representation.</p><p>We will have much more on Burris's controversial appointment on the next hour of \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" by the way.</p><p>Continuing with policies now, Democratic Al Franken is also hoping to be sworn in as a new senator tomorrow. Minnesota state canvassing board is expected to declare Franken the winner of one of the closest, most hotly contested and longest senate races ever.</p><p>Franken has beaten incumbent Republican Norm Coleman by 225 points. That's out of nearly 3 million votes cast. But Coleman has a number of possible legal challenges left, including contesting the entire recount. Because of that, it's unlikely that Franken, of course the former \"Saturday Night Live\" star, will be sworn in with the rest of the new senators tomorrow, but we shall see.</p><p>Some people are trying to cash in on the <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff </nameText></person>scandal, EBay is full of items featuring the Madoff's securities logo. There's this fleece jacket which the seller says is a piece of history; top bid right now, $510 for that. Check out this hat from the Madoff securities golf tournament from 2003, right now it's going for $217.50.</p><p>A steal, a bargain? I'm not sure.</p><p>You are up-to-date here on the Fox Business Network. For more news throughout the day, check out foxbusiness.com.

And Fox Business welcomes Charter Communications and Cox Communications in Hartford Connecticut. Hartford is the insurance capital of the world. We welcome you Hartford.</p><p>We're going to take a look at how the economy is impacting the insurance industry when \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" returns.</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>In this half hour we're going to take a look at how the insurance industry is faring in this economy. We're going to take a look at a new football league -- I know it's hard to believe -- and how they plan to compete with the NFL. And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill today. Much more on what could happen in that hearing later at 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time.</p><p>Well, the first full week of trading in the new year gets under way in less than 90 minutes. And investors are hoping Friday's 250-point gain is just the beginning.</p><p>Let's see how things are shaping up this morning. Take a look at the futures. As you can see right now, the Dow is down 6 points. The S&amp;P is pretty much unchanged. NASDAQ right now is up just a couple points. It's actually two hours before things get started.</p><p>I said 90 minutes, but you know I'm getting excited.</p><p>So what will 2009 mean to Wall Street?</p><p>Richard Suttmeier is the founder of the stock valuation Web site ValueEngine.com and Charles Payne, WStreet.com founder and FOX Business contributor.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Happy new year. It's good to see you, guys. We're back with another year.</p><p>All right. So Charles, there is so much to talk about. It's hard to know where to begin. But I guess the most important thing for people at home right now is, is this a good place to dip your toe in the water?</p><p>I mean do we start 2009 thinking I want to be an investor?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know what? I think -- I start 2009 thinking I want to be a trader. You know, whether or not you dip your toe in for the long -- listen, here are two thing. If you're really the type of person that's going to consistently put money into the market, fine, don't stop doing that because you'll eventually -- you will be buying at the bottom.</p><p>If you're that person who's been sitting on about 40 grand, waiting for the right moment, if you're willing to be nimble, then this is the time. If this -- if you think this is the time to buy and hold, you may have a better opportunity down the road.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, nimble. Now my man Richard over here is hyperventilating.</p><p>PAYNE: I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: He's like -- he's (INAUDIBLE) what's good about this. So, Richard, you're my technician and -- you do a lot of work on this. And you're not very bullish. Tell me why.</p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM CHIEF STRATEGIST: Well, over the near term it's -- the market is fine. It's in good shape. And we started out with a 3-percent gain for the Dow on Friday. So that's kind of like our handicap for the week, if you will.</p><p>I think, I think the Dow is trying to get up to the Election Day high, which was 9654, something like that. That's when President Obama or soon- to-be President Obama got elected. And so that was the good news.</p><p>Then we had the cascading of bad news that took us down to 7450. So that's kind of a trading range. And we're trying to get back to that Obama high by inauguration.</p><p>GLICK: But you think we will retest those lows?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I think, in the second half of the year, we'll go to lower lows because the second half recovery of 2009 will be as strong as the second half recovery we had in 2008 which everybody was talking about a year ago.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and didn't really happen.</p><p>You know, Charles, a lot is resting on this stimulus package, you know, to the tune of 800 billion, <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>is meeting with officials today on the Hill about it. Now we're hearing about $300 billion in proposed tax cuts.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: I mean, he's starting to really appeal to those blue dog Democrats and making sure that he's putting things in this package that are going to make Republicans and the blue dog Democrats happy.</p><p>How important is this package?</p><p>PAYNE: I think it's very important. You know, I'm working on a -- on a report right now for our subscribers, and I'm comparing his first 100 days in his -- in his presidency to three presidents, FDR, Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, because those are three guys who came in with very serious, ugly economic situations and had to make bold moves.</p><p>It's really a sort of a pleasant surprise, to be honest, that they've been talking about tax cuts to this degree. I would like to see him even friendlier to business. I'd like to see him give businesses a break.</p><p>Multinationals, allow them and bring money that they make overseas back into American without these onerous tax penalties, because that's one of the things that George Bush did that actually, in my opinion, worked, the Jobs Creation Act of 2004. It did create jobs and it brought a lot of money back to our shores.</p><p>So I think Wall Street is going to be excited about that. What's going to be intriguing today is -- today is to see how the infrastructures react to this news, because before it was like a trillion just to repair roads, maybe it won't all go to that.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. Yes. Well -- and part of the Obama camp situation is they need to provide things that are actually going to stimulate the economy and not long-term stimulate but short-term stimulate.</p><p>How do you feel about these new tax cuts?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I think that that.</p><p>GLICK: They're not new actually.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Well.</p><p>GLICK: Some of them will be.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I know, but I mean, come Friday and we see a loss of 500,000 jobs and a 7 percent unemployment rate and the fact that the economy in 2008 lost 2 million jobs, that's going to be hard to stomach in this environment.</p><p>And we need help from the housing market. Mortgages need to be redone. And we have not addressed that. That's what I've been saying for a year.</p><p>GLICK: This is your -- this is your mortgage mulligan that you.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Absolutely, 100 percent.</p><p>GLICK: So just before we go here, you tell me, the -- what is the quickest, easiest way to solve the housing problem.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Give everybody a mortgage mulligan, a do-over, and I mean the billions of dollars and trillions of dollars that we spent in 2008, if we had had done this a year ago, realizing that there was a problem in the housing market and people needed help making their monthly payments, we wouldn't be in the predicament we are today.</p><p>GLICK: Who pays for the mortgage mulligan?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Who's paying for all the other stuff?</p><p>GLICK: Uncle Sam.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Exactly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: All right.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Uncle Sam. I mean it -- it's not easy to determine who's to bailout -- who to bail out. But any problem is solved from the source. What started all of this? Bad mortgages that shouldn't be given to people. House prices that way -- that were way too high.</p><p>No one's addressed yet the fact that we still have $617 billion in construction and development loans. That's another 3 million homes that are on the books of the bank in terms of loans to builders and developers.</p><p>GLICK: That could fail, yes.</p><p>All right, guys, we're going to -- we have to leave it there.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: Richard, I know you're excited about this and -- give me that TARP list.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: I just want you to know that Richard does more homework than anybody I know. He sends us the best research. He has a five-page list here in the TARP program of what we, the American taxpayer, own.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Look at how little the lines are for -- these are all the companies that we own as taxpayers.</p><p>PAYNE: Over 200 banks; right?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: 282 banks now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: But who's counting?</p><p>SUTTMEIER: And seven of them are private banks. How -- I couldn't even buy one of these if I wanted to.</p><p>GLICK: 282 and counting. All right, gentlemen, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, we want to welcome our newest viewers on Cox and Charter Communications in Hartford, Connecticut. That city is known as the insurance capital of America. Home to insurance giants the big ones, Aetna and the Hartford.</p><p>You know the insurance industry pumps about $12 billion into Connecticut's economy and competes with other states such as Iowa for insurance payrolls and tax revenues.</p><p>With more on the state of the insurance industry and Hartford, I'm joined by Thomas Sullivan. He is Connecticut insurance commissioner, and Bob Hartwig is president and economist for Insurance Information Institute.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: Tom, let me start with you.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: You know we're in the midst of a very serious economic downturn. A lot of talk about the insurance industry in the wake of what happened to AIG last year.</p><p>What is this face of it? How -- how is it shaping up to look in 2009?</p><p>THOMAS SULLIVAN, CONNECTICUT INSURANCE COMMISSIONER: Well, the insurance sector has felt some of the pinch of the general economy, quite frankly, the insurance sector has been a little bit more depressed than general S&amp;P and some of the broader indexes.</p><p>But, overall, the -- industry is in good shape. We haven't had any major insolvencies. We haven't had really any insolvencies. And when you point out AIG, I would point out to you that AIG, its frailty has occurred in its holding company which is not regulated by state regulators like myself.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Bob, when we talk about insurance, we can go in so many different directions, obviously. There's life, there's property, there's casualty, but one thing the insurance industry normally does very well is it prepares for risks or shocks to the system.</p><p>Has it been better prepared than perhaps the rest of the financial arena, particularly what we saw in 2008?</p><p>BOB HARTWIG, INSURANCE INFORMATION INSTITUTE: Well, absolutely. Every day the insurance industry has to assume that the worse case scenario could happen, whether it's something like a 9/11, or a Hurricane Katrina, or a stock market wash out.</p><p>Sometimes all these happen -- happen at the same time. So we're prepared for that. So just take a look at the numbers. In 2008, 25 banks failed. Not a single insurance company failed as a result of the financial crisis, and so I think that's a very important distinction.</p><p>So at the end of this, I think that we'll see the insurers emerge with their risk management model which is one where we always retain some of the risk, we don't pack it off, sell it off to the securities markets and forget about it. We retain the risk, we have skin in the game every inch along the way.</p><p>GLICK: OK, and Bob, we should also differentiate, too, between life insurance and property and casualty, because I imagine that life insurance in a recessionary like environment like this would feel some heat because in essence it is one long-term source of an investment vehicle.</p><p>HARTWIG: Well, that's right. Some insurers can invest -- life insurers can invest for a longer term so they may be sensitive to fluctuations in different types of asset prices. That has happened but nevertheless they do build up very strong capital positions, designed to be resilient in market downturns.</p><p>The industry is very, very heavily regulated. It's also one that's fairly transparent. Have there been some short sellers having their way for times -- for periods of time in the market? That has happened. But the reality is insurers are writing new policies paying claims just as they did before the crisis hit.</p><p>GLICK: And, Tom, let me go back to the state of Connecticut. We talked about two of the largest insurers in the world, Aetna and Hartford, but you're also seeing competition with places like Iowa trying to get big insurers in there.</p><p>What are you doing on a state basis right now to make sure that this remains the capital of the insurance industry?</p><p>HARTWIG: Well, our -- hallmark has been insurance in terms of our economy and the state of Connecticut, Governor Rell and her administration have focused a lot of attention on the industry.</p><p>We've set up through the metro Hartford alliance effectively our chamber of commerce here in Hartford, an insurance and financial services cluster so that we can continue to leverage the talent that Connecticut has to be able to deliver to the insurance industry.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Tom and Bob, we're going to leave it there. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.</p><p>HARTWIG: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up, in today's economy, why would anyone want to start a new football league? Well, the Arena Football League folded its operations but now a new league plans to compete with the NFL. We're going to talk to United Football League commissioner coming up next.</p><p>And the Madoff hearings hit the Hill this morning. We're going to find out what changes might be in store for the SEC when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns. Stay with us. We'll be back in a few minutes.</p><p>GLICK: Well, this past weekend the road to the Super Bowl kicked off with the NFL playoff. I was glued to the television as usual.</p><p>Well, although the economy is down, sports economists expect the NFL to see an increase in the league's 2007 revenues which exceeded $7 billion. Those numbers have a couple of former finance executives thinking that there may be room for more pro football so they formed the United Football League.</p><p>It has six cities ready to go and is talking about giving fans an IPO investment in those franchises.</p><p>Here with the details on their deal I'm joined by UFL founder Bill Hambrecht. He's the CEO of the financial services firm WR Hambrecht and Company. And Michael Huyghue. He's the commissioner of the UFL and a former NFL executive.</p><p>Michael, let me start with you. There are a lot of people out there who say how could you consider doing something like this in this economy, particularly given what we have seen with the football, the Arena League which just folded?</p><p>Tell me a little bit about it and why you think you can do it.</p><p>MICHAEL HUYGHUE, UNIFIED FOOTBALL LEAGUE COMMISSIONER: Well, I'm a passionate football fan. And I think there's millions of passionate football fans. You just mentioned, you're watching the NFL games.</p><p>Our league is really a great opportunity for the spillover of talented football players to get an opportunity to play.</p><p>Kurt Warner is a classic example of a player who was sort of missed in the original selection of players in the NFL and he's had a prosperous career. There's hundreds of those type of players. And we just want to provide those opportunities as well as for coaches and front office executives.</p><p>GLICK: You know, Bill, you were known for what you have done in the investment and the Wall Street community, and here it is,. you're starting a football league. It doesn't necessarily go together.</p><p>Tell me why you wanted to do this.</p><p>BILL HAMBRECHT, UFL FOUNDER &amp; CHAIRMAN: Well, I thought there was a great attraction to having a football franchise owned by the public and by the fans and by the people who live in, in the city where the franchise is located.</p><p>So to me the -- my world of finance and IPOs and the football world came together.</p><p>GLICK: So Bill, so tell me how that works? Because you're talking about a stake, many people will liken to what happens with the Green Bay Packers, for example, but tell me how will this situation work.</p><p>I understand it'll be in as many as sixteen and cities to start.</p><p>HAMBRECHT: That's correct. There will be six cities, six independent franchises, and each franchise will be financed by local people, both private investors and public investors.</p><p>GLICK: So Michael you have, as we mentioned in the very beginning, you're a former NFL executive. You know what works in the football world, in the football community, and this is a different idea at a time when most people would say how could you possibly get the funding?</p><p>How do you get the participation? How do you get the players and the -- money to pay them the necessary salaries? Walk me through.</p><p>HUYGHUE: Sure.</p><p>COLLINS: How are you putting this all together.</p><p>HUYGHUE: Well, you know, it's an interesting time.</p><p>Clearly the economy is a tough time, but there are a number of people that are looking for opportunity. And our league is one of innovation. We are finding people that are excited about football in their markets that don't have NFL franchises to support.</p><p>They believe in the concept that there's a lot off talented football players out there. And so they're putting groups together. Each franchise is run by a chairman and he has five or six or seven local independent investors with them.</p><p>An d they're funding about $60 million to operate this franchises. We have about a $20 million player salary cap and we're going to get some exciting players. You know, I ran, the Jacksonville Jaguars, for the first seven years and I saw the same type of players I think we'll get in our league.</p><p>GLICK: And Michael, I have heard rumblings that you would even consider, perhaps if you could, trying to attract somebody like Michael Vick now that that Ryan is over at the falcons at the falcons and doing fairly well, one could argue -- doing well until this weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Sure.</p><p>GLICK: But -- is that true?</p><p>HUYGHUE: Well, it's going to be a league of opportunity. And we're certainly going to let the fans have a say in almost everything we do. In fact, we're putting up on our Web site Vick or no Vick? And he'll be one example of many players that will consider, of course, players like that have some interesting backgrounds, considerations that we'll have to consider.</p><p>But there's going to be a league of opportunity, and certainly he'll be one example of many players we will consider. Players like that have interesting background considerations that we will have to consider. It is going to be a league of opportunity. Certainly he will be one consideration.</p><p>GLICK: Bill, you know, I guess the number one thing you guys have to figure out is how you are going to differentiate yourself given particularly what has happened with the Arena Football League.</p><p>You tell me, how are you going to do that?</p><p>HAMBRECHT: Well, I think the big differentiation is that we're going into markets that the NFL is not established in or is leaving. So -- you know, basically the NFL has done a lot of things really well. They, they have a great product. They have a great sport. And they have, you know, just done a wonderful job of implementing.</p><p>But they have not expanded into some of the major growth areas of the United States. I mean, it is amazing when you think about it that Los Angeles does not have its own franchise.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>HAMBRECHT: Nor Las Vegas.</p><p>GLICK: So true. You know, Michael, before I let you go, I understand some big announcements will come during Super Bowl week, and that is it by as early as March 1, we will know the teams, and you'll start, you know, having people try out?</p><p>HUYGHUE: Yes, exactly right. We will have an announcement around Super Bowl week announcing the six owners and general managers and presidents. We already have a $20 million training facility in Casa Grande, Arizona that the city is building for as far as teams to compete in.</p><p>So we've got a lot of things. We start signing players March 1st. So we're really excited about the events coming up.</p><p>GLICK: I'm excited. More football is a good thing.</p><p>Michael Huyghue, great to see you, and Bill Hambrecht, as well.</p><p>Good luck guys and keep us up-to-date and come back during Super Bowl week to give us the first dibs on those cities. We'll analyze right here.</p><p>All right, gentlemen, thanks.</p><p>Let's get the very latest headlines with Jenna Lee. Good morning, Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: . taking a look at politics first.</p><p>President elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>is working on a tax cut plan which could be worth as much as $300 dollars.</p><p>Mr. Obama and leading Democrats are hoping the tax cuts will entice Republican support. Mr. Obama was hoping to get the bill written and ready for him to sign the day he takes office. But many say mid to early February is more likely timeline.</p><p>The tax cuts, by the way, are part of an economic stimulus plan worth as much as $775 billion dollars over the next two years. At least that's reportedly how much it is worth.</p><p>And last night Mr. Obama officially landed in Washington, D.C. His wife and daughters made the trip on Saturday. He said he's looking forward to being in Washington, but not exactly looking forward to living in a hotel for two weeks.</p><p>His daughters start a new school this morning. That's why they decided to go to Washington two weeks before the inauguration.</p><p>Well, imagine the situation. You've got an interview for the job you want, but if you take the interview, you are going to get fired from the job you have.</p><p>Boston college football coach, Jeff Jagodzinski, was just -- just led his team to a bowl game, faces that very situation. He's set to interview for the head coaching job with the New York Jets, but the ESPN reports if he does Boston College is actually going to fire him.</p><p>Apparently, though, the coach reportedly plans to go ahead with the plans and interview anyways.</p><p>I guess no risk, no reward.</p><p>You're up-to-date now the FOX Business Network. Now it's time for \"Charles's choice.\"</p><p>GLICK: Unbelievable. Getting fired for having a conversation with the JETS, unbelievable.</p><p>All right. In his Wall Street strategies hot line, Charles Payne says the start to a new year of trading Friday was surreal as retailers, homebuilders and tech stocks fared better than they should have and he says more good news could be coming.</p><p>\"The broad market or the board market has a nice wind in its sails and most of the major equity indices are on the verge of big-time breakouts.\"</p><p>Joining me now with more on this is -- in my bullish Mr. Charles Payne.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: So you're feeling good.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, and particularly from a short-term point of view. You know, it's interesting, Richard Suttmeier spoke earlier about his technical parameters, same thing. I'm looking at the Dow, there really is no resistance between 9000 and 9600.</p><p>S&amp;P is on the cusp of a major breakout as well. So you're going to get a lot of momentum players who've been sitting on the sidelines who feel like, you know what, better hop on this train.</p><p>GLICK: But do you also agree with Richard that we could, at some point this year, retest the lows?</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely. You know, I think what we're -- we're putting hope and - anticipation. A lot of this is rationalization.</p><p>GLICK: Around the inauguration, right?</p><p>PAYNE: It can't get worse than this. There's going to be a lot of money, and how long can we keep shrugging off bad news?</p><p>You know we'll see Friday will be the first test. If the numbers come in more than 500,000 people lost their jobs and the market still goes up, then I say ride this wave, but understand at some point these numbers do mean something.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Negatively.</p><p>GLICK: At some point the shoe has to drop.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Let's look at a couple of the names. First one, SalesForce.com.</p><p>PAYNE: SalesForce.com. You can see where the stock is really beginning -- you know, you can see it has some resistance right there. It's beginning to turn around here. This is a stock that I like a lot. We've talked about this before in the past. I think they're going to be acquired.</p><p>I will say, though, Alexis, it's an expensive stock, it's not cheap. It's trading at a six times book. Nevertheless, technically, it breaks out at 35, from there it has room to 40. And if they are acquired, it's been in the rumor mill for about two years.</p><p>GLICK: OK, and remind us, what do they do?</p><p>PAYNE: They do software. They compete with -- SAP and Oracle. In fact this guy who started this company used to work with Oracle and it just -- it's one of these things. I don't know if I would consider it mission critical but certainly, in this sort of economic environment, businesses would buy software to try to make things work out for them as opposed to spending money elsewhere.</p><p>GLICK: OK. CNH Global. Tell me about this company.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, you've heard of their products. Case, New Holland, big equipment, you know, a lot of agricultural stuff. Also a lot of construction stuff. And you know, this whole stimulus thing that we're talking about, same sort of thing.</p><p>You can see where the stock is just building a base here.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, building the bottom there.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. So right in the air, once it breaks through that point, I think it's off to the races. But, not just stimulus in America, you know, China, Europe, everywhere we're going to be seeing a demand for these sort of products.</p><p>The last two quarters they blew the cover off the ball but the quarters before that they missed. But this stock is so cheap down here. I love the risk-reward.</p><p>GLICK: OK. We have to leave it here. I know we're going to go into another one but we've got a lot more stuff to cover.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Charles, thank you very much. Good tips.</p><p>PAYNE: You got it. All right. s</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up we're going to go \"In the Pit.\" We're going to talk Madoff, more on the scheme and what, of course, will happen today in D.C. when -- testimony begins at 2:00 p.m. today. House Financial Services Committee are going to talk about it.</p><p>Also we want to welcome -- look at this.</p><p>PAYNE: Vegas. Whoa.</p><p>GLICK: Cox Communications in Vegas. We love Vegas.</p><p>PAYNE: Absolutely.</p><p>GLICK: We'd like to go visit you in Vegas. All right, that's coming up next. We'll be right back.</p><p>GLICK: Congress will be searching for answers today in a $50 billion scheme allegedly tied to <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff. </nameText></person>Lawmakers are going to be grilling the Securities and Exchange Commission over why it is that it took so long to uncover the scandal.</p><p>\"Wall Street Journal\" this morning saying that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in 16 years. Now the SEC also reportedly followed up on e-mails from a New York hedge fund that described madoff's business practices as highly unusual and yet nothing was done about it which is so incredibly frustrating.</p><p>Then, of course, we learn now that there are all these offshore accounts as well. What do you make of this?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, it's -- sort of the stuff that main street has always, you know -</p><p>GLICK: Paranoid about.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, that the fix is in, that the big guys everyone looks the other way even that -- even when they go in there, but this -- it's a very complicated situation.</p><p>I think the SEC needs to train their personnel a lot better, you know, the thing about today's hearings, though, the guy holding it, the representative, Paul (INAUDIBLE), I'm a little worried because he's already made certain comments, which makes me -- for instance, he's saying this whole thing provides a glaring example of Congress must provide reforms.</p><p>GLICK: Do something about regulation.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. So, you know, are we going in there to try to figure out the answers or are we going in there with preconceived, you know, political, and you know.</p><p>GLICK: He's been fighting for more.</p><p>PAYNE: . determination.</p><p>GLICK: He's been fighting for mire regulatory oversights since 2000 so this is going to give a lot of people who want more of regulatory.</p><p>PAYNE: There's no doubt about that but the question is, is that the problem? I mean after all the man was investigated.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: The investigations were run poorly. But he was investigated.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEE: And you have -- you had personal experience on that Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LEE: You thought that the people that came to your shop had weren't really equip to do it.</p><p>PAYNE: They had no clue. We I say no clue, it was sad. I men it's really weird, you know? You know as a registered investment adviser you get -- audited periodically. So we're being audited. They had two young kids right out of college. And they really had, what I said, Alexis, no clue. It was sad.</p><p>GLICK: That is what the former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt said to us this morning is you've to do something about the examiners, you know e young kids coming out of college.</p><p>They are not going to know how to look for loopholes in a $0 billion investment firm. Let's leave it there.</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's leave it there. Of course, we're going to continue to talk about that. Hearings will be at 2:00 p.m. today. We'll be covering that.</p><p>And coming up next, we're going to talk about Obama's fiscal stimulus plan. What does it look like? That's next.</p><p>ALEXIS GLICK, FBN ANCHOR: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick. Happy new year.</p><p>In this hour, we're going to take a look at <person><nameText>President-elect Obama's</nameText></person> new stimulus plan. And Woolworth's will close its doors overseas. So why does it have a business impact here? We're going to explain. And the latest installment of America's greatest business rivalries. It's a good one. It's about the burger wars. It's McDonald's versus Burger King.</p><p>But first, take a quick look at the futures here in the U.S. because this is going to be a very busy week for economic data, in particular those unemployment numbers due out this Friday. Right now the Dow is down 35 points. The S&amp;P is down 4. Nasdaq up 3. It's pretty much unchanged to start the morning.</p><p>Well, let's start hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST with the three things you should know this morning.</p><p>President-elect <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and congressional Democrats are looking to put forth a plan for $300 billion in tax cuts to both individuals and businesses. This is an attempt to gain Republican support for its more than $700 billion economic stimulus package. We'll talk more about that in a moment.</p><p>And French President Nicolas Sarkozy lands in Israel today to meet with Israeli President Shimon Perez. The two leaders will hold a working political meeting to discuss political and security issues in Gaza. Sarkozy will also met with the Palestinian Authority leaders in an attempt to push for a cease fire in the ongoing Gaza conflict.</p><p>And the <person><nameText>Bernard Madoff </nameText></person>scandal goes to Washington. The House Financial Services Committee beginning an open session this afternoon exploring the $50 billion Ponzi scheme. In the hot seat will be the Securities and Exchange Commission's inspector general after \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported this morning that the SEC examined Madoff's investment company eight times in as many as 16 years.</p><p>All right. Those are the three top stories you need to know about this morning. Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas market, let's go visit Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>Good morning, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis, and good morning, everybody.</p><p>We've had a positive day of trading in Asia overnight on this first full week of trading for 2009. And here in Europe, well, we're desperately hanging on, trying to stay positive but we're starting to sink just a little bit. Let's take a look at the latest numbers. Here in London, on the FTSE 100, we're now down about 0.2 percent. In France, on the CAC 40, down about 0.1. We've been in the same range ever since the opening bell. And the DAX 30 in Frankfurt up slightly by 0.1 percent. So not a whole lot of conviction right now.</p><p>But some bad news today, or some sad news certainly. It's been in business since 1759 in Ireland, but no more. Not unless a buyer can be found. Irish company Waterford Wedgwood announcing today it is calling in administrators for bankruptcy protection. The Irish group best known for Wedgwood pottery, Royal Doulton and Waterford Crystal, collapsed after talks over a possible investment in the business failed.</p><p>A glimmer of hope. Take it where you can. European investor confidence increased for the first time in seven months in January thanks to low interest rates and government measures to stimulate the economy. The latest index rising from minus 42 to minus 34. Doesn't sound that great, but the biggest jump in more than three years. And we'll take it.</p><p>Now let's go to Connell McShane for the three market movers of the morning.</p><p>Good morning, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, Ashley.</p><p>Keeping an eye on a number of things today, including the U.S. automakers. The big three from Detroit set to release their sales figures for the month of December and the rest of 2008 today. As you might expect, those numbers are expected to be pretty dismal. The American car maker selling 3 million fewer vehicles in '08. That's the forecast. If that's the case, the biggest drop since 1974, while the foreign competitors, Volkswagen and BMW, this morning, speeding towards an expansion. Their stateside market, there's a report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" about those expansion plans today as we look at the GM and Ford stock prices.</p><p>Now, number two, we want to take a look here at Walgreen for a moment. The drugstore chain just coming out as we speak with some same-store sales numbers for last month, the month of December. And it looks like stores open at least a year saw sales increased by 4.9 percent, as we look at Walgreen's stock price there. And that one over -- that one-year time span you're looking at is down about 25 percent. And it says that some calendar shifts had a positive impact on the month. And the pharmacy sales, comparable sales there, were up by 8.5 percent. And overall sales up almost 11 percent, 10.8. But again, sales at stores open at least a year up almost 5 percent at Walgreen.</p><p>And number three is Boeing, securing a contract worth $2.1 billion with India. The aircraft manufacturer is going to deliver at least 8 of the P- 81 anti-submarine and anti-surface warfare airplanes in the next four years. Boeing's looking to -- a bid for India defense projects totaling up to$20 billion over the course of 10 years.</p><p>And those are your three market movers of the morning, Alexis. Back over to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Connell, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>prepared to meet with economic leaders and economic advisors today in Washington. \"The Wall Street Journal\" is reporting that the future president is crafting a plan that could provide over $300 billion in tax cuts. Fox Business' senior Washington correspondent Peter Barnes joins us with the very latest.</p><p>Good morning, Peter.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Alexis.</p><p>The president-elect will start negotiating the details of a massive new stimulus plan, which may total around $700 billion, $800 billion or so, to save or create up to 3 million jobs. And we can confirm now that the president-elect will propose tax cuts of about $300 billion as part of that plan. That's from Democratic sources on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Now let's take a look at the plan's major provisions as we know them this morning. There would be $150 billion in tax cuts and tax credits for workers. $100 billion or so in tax breaks for companies to create jobs and to make new investments in plant and equipment.</p><p>The plan would extend unemployment benefits, including to part-time workers for the first time. The plan would expand Medicaid to unemployed workers, also for the first time. And other provisions could include subsidies to employers who continue health insurance coverage to laid off and retired workers.</p><p>All of this on the table today when the president-elect meets with top Democrats and Republicans on The Hill. The tax cut provisions, something that Republicans have been looking for, to support a stimulus plan.</p><p>The goal has been to try to get the work on the stimulus plan done and approved by both the House and Senate by the time Mr. Obama is inaugurated on January 20th, but congressional leaders warning this weekend that they will need more time to consider the plan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. STENY HOYER, (D) HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER: It's going to be very difficult to get the package put together that early so that it can have sufficient time to be reviewed and then sufficient time to be debated and passed. But we certainly want to see this package passed through the House of Representatives no later than the end of this month, get it over to the Senate and have it to the president before we break for the presidential break.</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, \"FOX NEWS SUNDAY\": And that's mid February?</p><p>HOYER: Early February, yes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES: And that, Steny Hoyer speaking with our own Chris Wallace on \"Fox News Sunday\" yesterday.</p><p>Mr. Obama has his first meeting this morning at 11:00 with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Peter Barnes, thank you very much.</p><p>Well, Mr. Obama says his proposed American recovery and reinvest plan is crucial to not only solving the current economic problems facing America, but challenges that may come along in the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. <person><nameText>BARACK OBAMA, </nameText></person>(D) PRESIDENT-ELECT: We need an American recovery and reinvest plan that not only creates jobs in the short term, but spurs economic growth and competitiveness in the long term. And this plan must be designed in a new way. We can't just fall into the old Washington habit of throwing money at the problem. We must make strategic investments that will serve as a down payment on our long-term economic future.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Well, for more on that estimated $775 billion stimulus plan, and if it will kick-start the economy, I'm joined by Dr. Peter Morici, an economist with the University of Maryland, and Erin Billings, the associate editor of the Capitol Hill newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Good morning, guys. Great to see you.</p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, good to see you. Happy new year.</p><p>DR. PETER MORICI, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND ECONOMIST: Happy new year.</p><p>GLICK: So you hear this morning about $300 billion in tax cuts. You're probably falling over in your chair. Wow, is he speaking of blue dog Democrats and Republicans or what?</p><p>MORICI: He absolutely is speaking to blue dog Democrats and Republicans. One problem I do see, though, is it's so complex. I mean the investment provisions are fairly arcane, which is going to lead to a lot of negotiations. And ultimately that's going to take time.</p><p>One of the advantages of a tax cut is it bites faster. But infrastructure spending gives you more bang for the buck longer term. If he wants strategic investments, that's the place to find them. The kinds of tax cuts he's talk about pretty much are retreads of past stimulus packages.</p><p>GLICK: Well, it's interesting, Erin, because, you know, there have been those who have suggested that the lions share of this fiscal stimulus package would be directed toward, you know, types of -- different types of infrastructure projects and yet here he is coming out with what could be tax cuts that far exceed those that President Bush put in twice during his eight years as president. I mean that's got to be a little bit of a shocker.</p><p>ERIN BILLINGS, \"ROLL CALL\" ASSOCIATE EDITOR: Well, Obama clearly is trying to lead from the center. And he knows he can't pass this if he doesn't have Republicans on board. They want tax cuts and he knows he needs them to come on board and sign on. So that's what we're seeing here.</p><p>He's trying to come up with something that will appeal to the masses. That's why he's taking the salesmanship directly to The Hill. He's meeting with these guys and he's saying, look, there's something in it for everybody. And he knows he's going to have to pass this with probably 80 votes in the Senate, and he wants a very strong majority in the House as well. This can't be a Democratic bill.</p><p>GLICK: OK. So, Peter, if we're talking about $800 billion, let's say for the sake of argument, we know $300 billion is directed towards tax incentives and loopholes and all those kinds of things, many of which are for small business owners. You tell me, when he has talked about 2.5 million, now up to 3 million either created or saved jobs, where does the jobs component of this fiscal stimulus plan factor in? Where are we going to create those jobs?</p><p>MORICI: Well, if we spend money and we get people buying goods and services again, we're going to get a multiplier effect. If we spend $100 billion on infrastructure, we'll get a $200 billion multiplier effect on GDP. Bottom line is, he has to raise GDP by about $330 billion to create 3 million new jobs, which means he has to spend, in the first year, about $330 billion because it takes some time to get the money out. So look for a stimulus package, if it's going to be consistent with this goal, of somewhere around $350 billion spent in '09, and about $350 billion spent in 2010.</p><p>GLICK: All right. So, Erin, walk me through the Republican argument here, because there are a lot of Republicans who are not to thrilled about this concept here. What do they not like about an $800 billion fiscal stimulus package?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you just said it, $800 billion. That's what they don't like. You know, the Republicans are trying to reclaim this fiscal discipline mantle that they enjoyed for the last, you know, what, 40 years, 30 years. They lost their way. They're trying to find it again. And they need to prove to the American public that they know who they are. And a big part of that is maintaining that fiscal discipline. They want to be the check and the balance on this new administration. So clearly that's where it starts.</p><p>Secondly, they want these tax provisions. They've been pushing for that behind the scenes. It looks like they're probably going to get it.</p><p>Thirdly, they want some time. They don't want to just have this rammed down their throats. They don't want to look like they're rubber stamping anything that the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>is bringing to The Hill. So they're going to try and at least slow the process so they can have input and try to at least get their imprint on it.</p><p>And so I think what you'll see at the end of the day is, we will have some kind of compromise proposal. It's not going to be everything Obama is laying out right now. It's it's probably not going to get done till February. I mean if the Democrats are lucky, they'll get it right before this February recess we're looking at, which begins on the 16th, I believe, of February. And Republicans are not going to sign on unless they get some of their wants in there.</p><p>GLICK: Well, and the good news is, at least a realistic expectations are being set and we're preparing the markets by telling then.</p><p>Peter, here's my opportunity, it's the new year, to get your assessment of where this economy is headed. This Friday we have probably -- arguably one of the most important numbers. We'll get the unemployment numbers for December, non-farm payrolls. Where is the economy headed?</p><p>MORICI: Well, in terms of numbers, we probably haven't seen the worst of it. GDP was only down a half a point in the third quarter. Fourth quarter GDP will probably be down 5 percent on an annualized basis. And in the next quarter, another 2 percent or 3 percent. So we're likely to see job losses continue through the first quarter.</p><p>Also, if we get a stimulus package say by the end of February, we're not going to get checks out to people until May 1. And we're not going to get any infrastructure spending till the second half of the year. So if we're looking for recovery in the economy, it's the second half.</p><p>However, don't be too down on the stock market because the stock market has factored this all in. Economists have been saying this for quite some time now. And so my feeling is the stock market has bottomed out and it will get its legs as long as the Democrat appear able to bridge the gap, reach consensus with the Republicans, as long as they're confident that the stimulus package is coming, businesses will see brighter prospects for the second half of the year and the market will lead us out of the recession. It won't be a lagging indicator, rather it will anticipate the recovery.</p><p>GLICK: Erin, the 11th Congress goes into session tomorrow. There's a lot of new Democrats taking positions. There's a perception out there that <person><nameText>President-elect Obama </nameText></person>will accomplish more because he's got more Democrats on his side. But he's clearly made some significant gestures over the past six weeks about what he's willing to do by walking across the aisle. Will they have success this year, not just for the fiscal stimulus plan, but with accomplishing other major intended goals?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, that's a great question. I mean, as you know, <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>ran as a candidate of change. He ran as a consensus candidate. And now he's going to try and govern as a consensus president. That is a real test. It's very easy to talk the talk. But now he's got to walk the walk.</p><p>As you mentioned, he's been reaching out to congressional Republicans. He's had his surrogates reach out to congressional Republicans in, you know, in the weeks after he won the election on November 4th. And now it really gets down to bras tax.</p><p>I mean the first real test is this economic stimulus. If he can get this through with bipartisan support, then I think that really is a harbinger of things to come. He's laid out a bunch of agenda items that are largely consensus items, but the stimulus may or may not be. So, you know, we'll have to see. It's going to take some time.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, time will tell.</p><p>BILLINGS: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, it's going to be very interesting because, you know, we sort of put health care and a lot of the other top issues on the back burner, all to talk about this stimulus program, which makes a lot of sense given the current environment.</p><p>Dr. Peter Morici, happy new year. As always, great seeing you.</p><p>And, Erin, stay with me because, Erin, you and I are going to talk about one of the big topics going into this 111th Congress because the other big story on The Hill is the man who's been tapped by (ph) Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to fill Mr. Obama's vacant Senate seat. <person><nameText>Roland Burris </nameText></person>will also be on Capitol Hill this week to begin his new job. Burris is facing opposition because of the Blagojevich scandal to sell Mr. Obama's seat. On yesterday's \"Meet the Press,\" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, who's defended his right to block Burris' appointment, said anything could happen. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID GREGORY, \"MEET THE PRESS\": There sounds to me like there may be some room here to negotiate and actually seat Burris.</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID, (D) SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: Hey, listen, David, I'm an old trial lawyer. There's always room to negotiate.</p><p>GREGORY: All right. So you're not saying no completely that he won't serve? That's what you're saying?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: All right. So what Burris will encounter in Washington and what role his financial background may play, we go back to Erin Billings. She's the associate editor of the Capitol newspaper \"Roll Call.\"</p><p>Erin, we only have just about 60 seconds here. What do you expect to happen in the coming days and how will that impact his ability to be sworn in as senator of Illinois?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, you know, as you know, the new Congress kicks off tomorrow. <person><nameText>Roland Burris </nameText></person>has said he's coming to down. The Democratic leaders are going to meet with him on Wednesday and I think they're going to try and kind of talk him down. Tell him, hey, maybe you should just back off. Let's see what happens with Governor Blagojevich.</p><p>As you know, the general assembly is moving to impeach him. I think the Democrats would ideally like to have him ousted and then the lieutenant governor could then make the selection. But you're right, Harry Reid left the door just slightly ajar. And even though his aides are now saying, well, there's not really room for negotiation. He may -- you know, maybe they're reading too much into it. Certainly Harry Reid doesn't do things on accident.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. No, I mean, it was interesting Harry Reid's comments there yesterday. He was really couching it. But is there a chance that the Senate will say no, you cannot take the seat?</p><p>BILLINGS: Well, I don't think there's really a lot of support to give him the seat, even on the Republican side. I mean the Republicans, Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, said on Sunday on a different show that, you know, that there should be a special election in Illinois to deal with this. And so everyone is looking at this cloud of corruption and no one seems to think that this is the process by which they should appoint the new senator from Illinois.</p><p>So I think it would be a really heavy lift unless there was some kind of a bipartisan deal. Harry Reid is going to meet with McConnell this morning, or today, to talk about the situation. I think they're going to try and figure out if there's a bipartisan road to go down. But it's anybody's guess.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Erin Billings, thank you so much for sticking with us. We appreciate it.</p><p>BILLINGS: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to take a quick break. When we come back, we'll talk more about what's going on in the Gaza Strip and what the implications might be for Israel.</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, the pressure is mounting on Israel to stop its 10-day offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But Israel says the attacks will continue until militants stop firing rockets at its citizens. Fox New's David Lee Miller is live on the Gaza border this morning with the very latest.</p><p>Good morning, David.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>That's right. The defense minister, Ehud Barak, paid a visit to some of the troops on the front lines a little earlier today and he also said today, speaking at the Connesset (ph), that the Israeli offensive is going to continue until there is peace and tranquility along Israel's border with Gaza.</p><p>Today, nevertheless, at least 24 rockets have been fired. In fact, that was the figure up until we went on the air. Then shortly -- I'd say less than 30 seconds ago, another rocket was fired off in the distance headed into Israel. So that makes at least 25 rockets that have been fired today. A number of them literally flew over our heads. One reaching as far as 25 miles into Israel, into the city of Beersheva.</p><p>Meanwhile, on the ground, Israeli forces have effectively now surrounded Gaza City. Gaza City and its nearly half a million residents. There has been a great deal of fighting on the ground. But for the most part, the Israeli forces are staying out of the urban areas. They are staying on the outskirts of Gaza City.</p><p>Hamas, meanwhile, is trying to draw them into the more urban environments for some type of guerrilla conflict. The Israelis say that they are constantly moving on the ground. In the words of one commander, they don't want to be sitting ducks. They are there to find the militants.</p><p>Now, as for the death toll, the figures provided by Palestinian medics, they say that as many as 60 Palestinians have been killed, only six of which they say were militants. The remainder, they say, are civilians and many of them are children. These are figures that we cannot independently confirm. As for the Israeli casualties, one soldier has been killed since the ground incursion got underway. And as many as 40 have been injured.</p><p>And, lastly, there is some progress to report on the diplomatic front. We've got the EU involved, the French president involved, the United Nations involved. Perhaps the best hope for some type of diplomatic solution here now, Alexis, is a delegation that has -- I am told we've got another strike off in the distance. You can see the cloud of black plume of smoke.</p><p>Let me finish making my point as you take a look at this latest Israeli air strike. A delegation of Hamas has left Syria, heading towards Egypt, for a meting tomorrow. It is expected at this meeting the Egyptians are going to demand that Hamas move forward with the cease fire process and stop the rocket attacks. What influence they're going to have, that is somewhat questionable. Only a short time ago, before this conflict began, Egypt asked Hamas to stop the rocket attacks. Hamas ignored that request. This time around maybe they'll see things differently with Israeli forces on the ground, in the air, and at sea, all targeting Hamas in Gaza.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: David, I imagine, you know, just watching that bomb go off behind you there, that you're in a very dangerous area there on the border in Gaza. Just give us some feeling of what's going on around you as we're kind of watching this unfold. I imagine this is pretty scary.</p><p>MILLER: It's a little unnerving at first. I won't say you get used to it, but this is the way people live along southern Israel, and they have been living for years with these rocket attacks a regular part of their lives. But recently, because of the increase in these rocket attacks, life had to change. They've stopped school. Parties have been stopped. Social events had to be rescheduled. So there has been a significant change in people's lives here.</p><p>But for the most part, for most Israelis, life does go on. This is something they have to cope with. They just have to change their daily habits. But when these rockets are launched, you've got 15 to 45 seconds to take cover. And let me tell you -- I'm losing my voice here -- that 15 seconds can be a very, very long. You wait 15 seconds for that rocket to hit and you just hope it's not going to land anywhere near you.</p><p>Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right. David Lee Miller, be safe. Thank you very much, from Fox News, for joining us this morning, bringing us up to date on this story.</p><p>All right, guys. Well, from what's going on in the Gaza Strip, to what's going on with the <person><nameText>Bernie Madoff </nameText></person>scandal. Coming up next, we're going to bring you up to date on the very latest on this 2:00 p.m. committee sub hearing about what happened here and all the ties. It's a terrible story. But, of course, we'll bring you up to date on that in just a moment.</p><p>WEBSTER: And welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Ashley Webster in London, keeping track of the overseas markets for you.</p><p>And it's generally been positive, certainly in Asia overnight. And we started positively enough here in Europe, although perhaps not with a lot of conviction. But now sentiment has turned just a little more bearish.</p><p>Let's take a look at the latest numbers for you in London. We've been up about a quarter to a half a percent for most of the day so far. But now we've turned negative. We're down now about a half a percent on the FTSE, down 28 points. Also on the CAC 40 in Paris, down half a percent. And on the DAX 30 in Germany, also down about a third of a percent.</p><p>There has been some speculation, of course, of a big stimulus package being passed by the <person><nameText>Obama administration </nameText></person>when it comes into power. That gave some impetus, if you like, to the Asian trading. But so far into Europe haven't picked up on that sentiment quite strongly, although we have seen the higher oil prices lift some of the sectors. The oil sector certainly benefitting from that. Although now we're seeing even the oil stocks turn slightly negative. Royal Dutch Shell down now 3 percent.</p><p>We're also seeing some weakness in the European auto sector, including a couple of downgrades today for both Renault in France and Porsche. New car registrations in France plunged in December, down 24 percent. All of this spelling more tough news for the automakers. Renault down 5 percent in Paris. Porsche also down now 5 percent.</p><p>We've also seen a lot of money coming out of gold. Gold trading in London down $26 an ounce to right around $853. As a result, though, we've seen the dollar get stronger against most of the foreign currencies, including the euro and the British pound. The dollar coming in right now at 1.44 against the British pound.</p><p>All right. Back to New York now and Jenna Lee for the latest news headlines.</p><p>Jenna.</p><p>JENNA LEE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Well, thank you so much, Ashley.</p><p>And we begin with a sad story to update you on. We could soon find out what killed Jett Travolta. Today, an autopsy will be done on the 16-year- old's body. And it is believed at this time that he had a seizure and hit his head on the bathtub. Of course, Jett is the son of actor John Travolta, and as well as actress Kelly Preston. They released a statement saying, \"Jett was the most wonderful son that two parents could ever ask for. We are heart broken that our time with him was so brief.\" So, again, we'll keep you updated as we hear more.</p><p>In the meantime, we're just going to turn to another story coming off the weekend. The new year's weekend box office went to the dogs this time. 20th century Fox's \"Marley &amp; Me\" held on to the top spot, pulling in just over $24 million. Disney's \"Bedtime Stories\" came in second with just $20.3 million. It was followed by Paramount's \"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,\" United Artists \"Valkyrie\" and Warner Brother's \"Yes Man.\" All those rounding out the top five.</p><p>Also, Will Smith has been voted the top money-making movie star of 2008 in the 76th annual Quigley Poll. The star of Columbia Pictures, \"Seven Pounds\" is the only -- the second African-American actor after Sydney Poitier to top t he poll. Robert Downey Jr. came in second and Christian Bale claimed third.</p><p>All right. You're up to date here on the Fox Business Network. Coming up, we're going to take a look at one of America's greatest business rivalries. It's the king versus Ronald McDonald. The battle of two multi-billion dollar companies continues to heat up. Stay with us. You don't want to miss it.</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back to MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.</p><p>This half-hour, we're going to take a look at the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King, two of my favorites. And we're going to look at the end of the road for retail giant Woolworth.</p><p>And Fox 50 member Federal Express is raising rates as its shipping volume continues to slip. Will it affect the stock? We'll talk about that.</p><p>Take a quick look at the futures, as we're one hour away from the market opening right now.</p><p>The Dow is now down 50, we're down about half a percent. The S&amp;P, as you can see, is down about 6 points. It's down about .6 percent. And the Nasdaq is also down about half a percent.</p><p>We're at the lows of the morning. We'll see how that shapes up as we head closer to the bell.</p><p>Now it is time for this week's edition of \"America's Greatest Business Rivals.\"</p><p>MCSHANE: All right, Alexis.</p><p>In this week's edition of the series here ongoing, we do heat up these burger wars, McDonald's and Burger King. Burger King brought in $2.5 billion in the year 2008, while McDonald's earned $6.3 billion in the third quarter alone. So that kind of tells you how they stack up against each other. Certainly a lot of hamburgers no matter how you slice it.</p><p>And while the two of them expand their empires here in 2009 to offer items like lattes, even burger-scented body spray, apparently, we're going to take a look back now at where these two rivals first fired up their grills.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE (voice-over): The Big Mac versus the Whopper. Flame broiled versus grilled. McDonald's versus Burger King. It's one of America's hottest business rivals that, after more than 50 years, shows no slowing down in the fast food wars.</p><p>Burger King and McDonald's burst onto the scene during the all-American 1950s. Burger King set up shop in 1954 and McDonald's in 1955. Since then, they've taken each other on pound for pound.</p><p>Over the past 50 years, they built franchise after franchise throughout the world. Burger King's signature burger, the Whopper, sizzled onto its menu in 1957. McDonald's fired off its Big Mac in 1968. And the crispy, salty fries, well, they have been perfected over the years. Customers have flocked to these rivals, partly because of all the choices and the convenience, but they also haven't had to empty out their pockets to eat there.</p><p>The country's attachment to fast food didn't go unnoticed. By the 1990s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell and Subway were eating into these rivals' marketshare. And not much later, national obesity and nutrition concerns became prominent.</p><p>So these days, Burger King and McDonald's have expanded into healthy foods and even list the calories on their menus in some states and cities. Believe it or not, Burger King now offers veggie burgers and kids' meals. McDonald's now includes salads and chicken sandwiches.</p><p>Whether you have a beef with the burgers or you take a bite out of them, deciding to own a franchise might be found in the numbers. If you owned a Burger King franchise in 2004, your sales could have reached $1 million. And in 2007, sales could have risen to $1.2 million. A McDonald's franchise in 2004 could have earned you $1.6 million in sales, and three years later you could have brought in $1.9 million.</p><p>Would you buys a franchise today?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCSHANE: All right. So, for more on these burger wars, we're going to send it over to Alexis.</p><p>And to do so, I'm going to be back here, Alexis, in just a moment with some news out of Apple, because <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has just sent a letter out, which he says, among other things, that he's been losing weight throughout 2008, but the reason has been a mystery to him and his doctors. We'll look through that and get some more details in just a moment.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. No, I'm just seeing this press release coming out from the board of directors.</p><p>Great point there, Connell. We'll cover that breaking news story in just a moment.</p><p>But let's finish up on the rivalry between McDonald's and Burger King. I think I'm a fairly good expert on this.</p><p>I'm joined by Sheri Daye Scott, editor-in-chief for \"QSR\" magazine, and Steve West, the vice president of equity research for restaurants for Stifel Nicolaus.</p><p>Good morning, guys.</p><p>Sherri, let me start with you.</p><p>Burger King and McDonald's, it's a rivalry that has been legendary. Where does it stand right now?</p><p>SHERRI DAYE SCOTT, \"QSR\" MAGAZINE: Well, you know, McDonald's is number one. They've been number one for a long, long time. But Burger King has kind of carved its own niche into the market, and they're doing well in that niche.</p><p>The two are playing in different markets. McDonald's is focusing on mom and kids, and Burger King is focusing on those young edgy guys. And both are number one in those markets.</p><p>GLICK: And so I imagine, Steve, that each of the two, Burger King and McDonald's, they've figured out how to remain competitors in a marketplace that they feel has enough room for each of them to be the dominant players.</p><p>STEVE WEST, STIFEL NICOLAUS: Yes, that's exactly right. They've both, over the last several years, have really evolved their menus to ad, as we mentioned before, healthier type options.</p><p>Now, is it healthy food? I wouldn't go that far. But when you can go to McDonald's and get grilled chicken sandwiches, salad, you can go to Burger King and get -- they call them apple fries, basically sliced apples, Mac and cheese for the kids, they are focusing on healthy items, they are focusing on premium items. That helps drive those sales at the franchisees that you mentioned earlier. So things are doing very well.</p><p>And when we think about the consumer here in the U.S., we typically spend almost half of our food dollars every year at restaurants. That trend hasn't changed that much over the last couple of years, even in these recessionary times that we're in.</p><p>What we're seeing is people are trading down to fast food because of the value, because of the convenience. It's definitely a win-win for McDonald's and Burger King right now.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and it's been reflected in their stock price even while this recession, many suggest, began in the fourth quarter of last year.</p><p>Sherri, let me turn to you, because their marketing strategies are very, very different. I mean, Burger King has this virgin Whopper thing going on right now.</p><p>How is it that they are a reflection of the company and who they are and who they're trying to target?</p><p>SCOTT: Well, you know, to the point about what I mentioned earlier, the two different marketing groups, Burger King realized McDonald's is going to own those mom and kids, so about four or five years ago, they went after the younger, more edgier crowd. And Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky out in Miami is really leading that charge.</p><p>What they're doing is they're making people talk about Burger King. The Whopper, the virgin Whopper campaign, it's making people talk about their preferences.</p><p>Do you like the burger? Do you like the Whopper? Do you prefer the Big Mac?</p><p>Burger king has done a great job of just getting their name out into the public, getting people to talk about Burger King, whether it's subservient (ph) chicken campaign they did a few years ago where they had the dancing chicken, whether it's the king in those kind of edgy and somewhat creepy ads to people. People are talking about Burger King in a way they probably weren't five or six years ago.</p><p>GLICK: So, Steve, you know, in the midst of this serious economic downturn, each company is trying to do the right thing to differentiate themselves in the international environment, in addition to the domestic.</p><p>What are they trying to do to make sure that those marketshare numbers continue to grow as not just the U.S. economy faces recession, but the global economy faces a recession?</p><p>WEST: Well, they're doing really a lot of the same things. If you look at what McDonald's -- and I call it the McDonald's playbook, you know, when they came out with their plan to win in 2003, really focusing on the stores, making sure the stores looked nice, focusing on store level execution, and getting that menu right, making it \"relevant,\" they're doing the same thing in Europe.</p><p>They're remodeling stores. They shut down a lot of older, dirty looking stores. They're making the menu relevant. You know, instead of just taking a cookie cutter U.S. menu and applying it to Europe, as they used to do, and the rest around the world, they're also making them -- they're customizing the burgers and the chicken and the things like that with local flare.</p><p>GLICK: Right.</p><p>WEST: And that makes it relevant. And they're also offering value. So they're really doing the same things around the world that they have been in the U.S., and it's been very successful, even in these downturns that we're seeing in Europe and Asia.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. Well, Sherri and Steve, we're going to leave it there. There's nothing more exciting than talking about the hamburger war at McDonald's and Burger King.</p><p>Thank you, guys. I'm starving now. I'm like ready to go get some fast food.</p><p>Thank you guys very much.</p><p>Well, we do have some breaking news surrounding the health of Apple CEO Steve Jobs. I want to go back to Connell. Connell has been following this story for us.</p><p>And Connell, I understand there is a statement coming out of the board of directors as well.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes. Two things here.</p><p>One is a letter being sent out by <person><nameText>Steve Jobs. </nameText></person>We talked before you started that segment about the fact that he acknowledges the weight loss issues that we've all seen when <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>has appeared in public within the last year.</p><p>He says that he has been losing weight. And up until now, or up until recently, that weight loss had been a mystery to him. But now going over some of the reasons in this letter that he has written, says the doctors think they found the reason for it, and they expect it will take him until late spring to regain the weight and body mass.</p><p>Now, that reason, according to <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>and his doctors, is this -- he says that they cite a hormone imbalance that has been, to quote from his letter, \"... robbing me of the proteins my body needs to be healthy.\" So, again, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>saying his doctor says he has a hormone imbalance and that is the reason he's been losing weight. And they think that he can put this weight back on, and he will continue as apple's CEO during his recovery.</p><p>He says the remedy for nutritional problems is a simple one and it's straightforward. And they've already begun the treatment for it.</p><p>So on this news, it looks like the Apple stock is actually jumping up a little bit in premarket trading. We'll continue to follow that particular angle of it.</p><p>Now, you mentioned that the board of directors had put out a statement as well. They say, \"It's widely recognized both inside and outside of Apple that <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>one of the most talented and effective CEOs in the world...\" And they go over what they said in the past.</p><p>They said if it ever comes to a day when Steve wants to retire, or for other reasons can't continue as the CEO, you will know it. That is basically the answer that they've given us in the past.</p><p>But again, <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>acknowledging the weight loss that he has had. As you see here in some of this video in which he face had looked drawn, a lot of people had talked about that the last time he had appeared on stage. And now saying it's because, Alexis, of a hormone imbalance and he is taking treatment for that.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Connell, thank you very much for bringing us up to date on that.</p><p>We of course are going to continue to discuss it right now, because we're going to switch gears here. Richard Suttmeier is with me, and Charles Payne is here with me to talk more about what the implications might be here for Apple.</p><p>You know, Charles, people have been saying for at least a year now that they've got to come up with a succession plan. Now, at least, we have some sense as to what the illness that's affecting the man behind Apple. But will there be greater calls perhaps to have him do what Bill Gates did at Microsoft, assume the chairman role and perhaps look for a future successor in the CEO role?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, I think the street would like to know who the successor might be, but I don't think anyone would like to see <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>step down if he's capable of doing both jobs right now. He is obviously the heart and soul of the company. That's why he's so important.</p><p>You don't talk about any other individual in the company there or associated with in this market more than <person><nameText>Steve Jobs </nameText></person>and Apple. So this is good news. The stock obviously indicating a little bit higher.</p><p>There's still going to be some rumblings, though. A lot of folks are saying, listen, you know, he suffered from pancreatic cancer. That is typically a pretty deadly disease. And until this is totally resolved, we see him put on weight, people are going to speculate.</p><p>GLICK: Richard?</p><p>RICHARD SUTTMEIER, VALUEENGINE.COM: Well, I'm going to take it from the standpoint of what Value Engine describes Apple computer. It seems like when it gets to an $85 handle, it becomes a buy-rated stock. When it gets into the s$90, it becomes a hold-rated stock.</p><p>So this morning, from a trading perspective, I'm going to see how many times this year I can make that same five to seven points. So my subscribers...</p><p>GLICK: So it's range bound though.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: It's range bound. And so I'm going to use this strength to, say, book profits on a buy-rated stock that's now a hold.</p><p>PAYNE: That's right, because our subscribers are in the stock, too, on an average of about 86 bucks. And I'm going to grapple with that as well because, technically, it doesn't have a lot of resistance between here and R100, but it comes down fairly quickly when it stops moving.</p><p>GLICK: How much, guys -- I don't want to say is the bloom off the rose? Because this is considered the darling in the tech world. But in terms of new innovation and new products? Or is that just because, as my husband said to me yesterday, we have Mac computers all over our house and you just don't need to upgrade them as often because the fact of the matter is, they're built terrific, they do the right things, and so you don't have to upgrade them very often?</p><p>PAYNE: Well, it's interesting you brought up Mac computers, because everyone has talked about the halo effect from iPhones and iPods, and how that would introduce audiences to the Mac computer. People are looking at this MacWorld Conference for something on the Mac PC. That's what they want to see, because they're doing exceptionally well in all other areas in the business.</p><p>We should also remind the audience, a pretty upbeat article in Barron's over the weekend on Apple. And this morning, (INAUDIBLE) Brothers also had positive comments on them. So the street and analysts liking what they're seeing.</p><p>GLICK: But Jobs isn't, as I -- right? He's not doing the presentation, or whatever, right?</p><p>PAYNE: He's not. He's not going to be...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: And that's the first time. So some are going to suspect that if he is not doing it, it's because either they're not excited about it or perhaps that's why they put this release out today, is because he's now being treated.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Well, I would agree with that. He's being treated, and hopefully the man gets well again and comes back out in six months with the weight back on and announces another nano-nano, small-small device.</p><p>PAYNE: But by the same token, you do at some point want other people in the company to be associated with good news.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: So hopefully whoever does make the presentation will say, \"Hey, look at this.\" And everyone will say, \"Wow!\" so that we're excited about hearing from other folks. You know, any corporation, though, if the CEO is scheduled to speak and doesn't speak, the stock is going to get slaughtered.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean, that's the thing that concerns me here, is that, you know, we've talked about this with the Warren Buffett situation as well, when you desire as a shareholder some kind of succession plan.</p><p>It doesn't mean it has to be put in place. I mean, look, Wal-Mart decided to do it at a time that some suggest, wow, why would you do it now? But at least something. And I guess maybe we can read into who they select to do the presentation.</p><p>SUTTMEIER: I mean, now it's \"Wow, but I can't afford it\" from the consumer standpoint. Let's see if I get my tax return. I get a tax refund, maybe a \"wow\" product, I'll spend it on that.</p><p>GLICK: Except that they made this great deal with Wal-Mart, right, where they're selling their devices. So that's -- you know, everybody seems to be moving in that direction.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. Everyone was pretty excited about it. They seem to be doing -- firing on all cylinders right now outside of the health issue with <person><nameText>Steve Jobs.</nameText></person></p><p>SUTTMEIER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys. We're going to leave it there.</p><p>Richard and Charles, thank you, guys, very much.</p><p>Let's go to Ashley Webster in London and get a check and update on what is going on in the overseas markets. And he's also going to bring us up to date on what is happening with Woolworths.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. Thank you, Alexis. That's the big story.</p><p>Tomorrow, the 600 remaining Woolworth stores will close in the United Kingdom, bringing to a close an era of retail discounting. Really, they really were the original Wal-Marts, as one much my guests just referred to it. We'll get to that in a minute.</p><p>Now, the U.S. stores that, of course, become synonymous with American retail, the Woolworth stores in the United States even played a role in the civil rights movement. They began closing their doors though in the U.S. some 29 years ago, converting in many cases to a new store, the Foot Locker. We'll explain how that happened as well.</p><p>So for more on Woolworths' international legacy, I am joined by Sam Poser, who is vice president and senior researcher analyst for Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach. And also joining me here in studio, Allyson Stewart-Allen, who is director of International Marketing Partners.</p><p>And Allyson, I'll begin with you.</p><p>This really is the end of an era, isn't it? But you would have thought that someone like Woolworths were better prepared to handle an economic downturn than many other stores.</p><p>ALLYSON STEWART-ALLEN, DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL MARKETING PARTNERS: Yes, you would have thought so. And the thing that's fairly emotional for a lot of British people about the closure of Woolworths here is the fact that it's a store format that was quite innovative in its time.</p><p>You know, the five and dime was something that in the U.K. was beforehand not known. You know, this time, with the Woolworths, you can go in, you can choose what you want, it's very discount-oriented and invented the discount category of retailing in the U.K. So oddly enough, the fact that it invented this category here, and now this innovator is no longer...</p><p>WEBSTER: So what went wrong? That's the question.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Well, that's a really good point. What usually goes wrong with retailers of al kinds, and in particular Woolworths, is the fact that they didn't really keep up with who their customer was.</p><p>So they changed their categories, they didn't merchandise very well. They didn't have the depth of ranges that their customers expected.</p><p>The in-store experience became increasingly bleak as all of those around them upgraded their offerings. So they didn't keep up with the trends, they didn't keep up with the in-store environment. They didn't keep up with the merchandise. And all of that is a recipe for total disaster.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sam, let's go to you.</p><p>Woolworth closed its stores in the 1980s and '90s, closing the door on the final stores in 1997. So it's been some 11 years in the U.S.</p><p>How did this brand evolve into Foot Locker? How did that come about?</p><p>SAM POSER, VICE PRESIDENT, STERNE, AGEE &amp; LEACH: Well, the last Woolworth store closed -- Woolworth divested to Europe in 1982, and the last Woolworth store closed in 1997. It was just the evolution of the business at the Woolworth Corporation, now Foot Locker Corporation, into an athletic specialty business.</p><p>And as that business became the dominant factor overall, Foot Locker spun off the various businesses that didn't work quite as well for them. And now it's evolved into the world's largest athletic specialty retail chain.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. And Sam, given the current economy, how is Foot Locker performing?</p><p>POSER: Well, Foot Locker's sales have been sort of stagnant over the last few years, but they've begun to manage their businesses significantly better than they have in the past. The stock to sales ratio, inventory levels and so on, have improved dramatically this year. Basically, the best ratio in about five years.</p><p>We expect earnings to -- we're not looking for much earnings growth in the next year or so, but we do see -- due to reduced top line. However, we do see the efficiencies improving dramatically and then beginning to take more share. They faced some problems recently because the athletic footwear trend has been soft, but that's improving now.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. Well, Sam and Allyson, I just want to ask you, very quickly, five seconds, what kind of legacy does Woolworths leave behind?</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Interestingly, the granddaughter of Mr. Woolworth, Barbara Hutton, had a house built in Regents Park called Winfield House.</p><p>WEBSTER: Right.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: And that is now the home of the American ambassador. So you can close the high street stores, but they're still here in another form.</p><p>WEBSTER: The legacy lives on.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: It does.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right.</p><p>Sam Poser, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>Allyson Stewart-Allen -- I want to call you Allyson Stewart-Allyson. I just like the word Allyson.</p><p>Thank you very much, anyway, for being here.</p><p>STEWART-ALLEN: Thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: All right. When we come back, \"The One Thing You Should Know.\" So don't go away.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Now it's time for \"The One Thing You Should Know.\"</p><p>We get started with Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>Ashley, what do you have for us?</p><p>WEBSTER: Well, let me tell you, Alexis. Today is somewhat of a sad and interesting day. And I'll tell you why.</p><p>It's the number one day for divorces to be filed. In fact, this is the busiest week of the year, and this is the busiest day of the busiest week. And you know why? Because the stress of the holidays is the final straw that broke the camel's back, and today is divorce day. So it's not very encouraging, but somewhat interesting.</p><p>GLICK: That is very sad. How do you know that, Ashley?</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes. I know. Sorry.</p><p>GLICK: That's not good.</p><p>WEBSTER: Sorry.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PAYNE: It's sad, but I'm impressed how fast it happens. You know what? \"What did you buy? Oh, no!\"</p><p>GLICK: Yes. \"How much money did you spend? You're out!\"</p><p>All right, Jenna, what is your one thing?</p><p>LEE: Well, the one thing is this Apple story. I think this is the biggest story of the day. We had the stimulus plan, you had the auto sales, but really how investors take in what is going on with <person><nameText>Steve Jobs, </nameText></person>I think that's going to be the most interesting story to watch today, for sure.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. And his letter to shareholders was very passionate, very forthright. We're going to do more of that letter coming up on \"THE OPENING BELL,\" but we'll show you it. But it was pretty incredible.</p><p>PAYNE: It is. And, you know, he's just one of these incredible guys whose story everyone knows, and a Horatio Alger-type story.</p><p>But I think, also, this stimulus thing with <person><nameText>President-elect Obama, </nameText></person>the notion of making tax cuts such an important part of this, just may be a very brilliant move. Gold has gone down a lot, the dollar is beginning to rally. I think international markets like the news, and I think a lot of conservative investors in America like the news as well.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. It's going to change the ballgame.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: I think it is.</p><p>PAYNE: You know, he's taken bits from all -- he's taken bits from FDR, Eisenhower and Reagan. And...</p><p>GLICK: I can't wait to see this report that you're writing.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. It's coming out great. It's coming out great. A lot of work though. I always bite off more than I can chew.</p><p>GLICK: I'm so excited. We're going to dedicate a lot of time to that, because he's writing this really in-depth report about the first 100 days for each of those presidents.</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And those are the three guys, I think, three presidents that I think are going to be very important, their game plans and how successful they were.</p><p>GLICK: All right. I look forward to it.</p><p>All right, guys. Well, before we go, we want to welcome San Diego, Cox Communications in San Diego.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>PAYNE: Whoa -- San Diego, too? So we've got Connecticut, San Diego and Vegas.</p><p>GLICK: We've got -- yes, right? We've got Vegas, we have San Diego, and we have Hartford, Connecticut.</p><p>Welcome, guys. We're so excited to have you guys.</p><p>All right. Stay with us. \"THE OPENING BELL\" is coming up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Especially in the tech industry.  The sunshine state becoming a hotbed for innovation and businesses are taking notice.  Moving their operations down south and creating nearly half a million new jobs.  Since Governor Rick Scott took office in 2010.  I spoke to him just a short time ago in a Fox Business exclusive.  </p><p>      (on camera):  Thank you so much for coming on the program.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, tell me, is it true, did you all go to Roger Ailes (ph) and say, look, we need to move to Florida?  We like the fact there is no income tax, better weather, close to Latin America.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  You're speaking my language.  Singing my song, speaking my language.  Yes.  I love that idea.  We would move to Florida in a heartbeat.  Tell me, you're doing incredible things in your state that would make other states very envious.  I'm looking at Amazon moving to Tampa, bringing more than 1,000 jobs with it.  300 million in capital. Time Warner moving to Tampa, with 500 new jobs.  $5 million in capital investment.  What did you have to offer them to get that done?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  You know, we're a great state.  No income tax and we're a right-to-work state.  The gateway to Latin America.  We have 5 million multilingual speakers.  We have great universities, have brand new - brand new universities that are just doing science technology, engineering and math.  So, we're talking to companies every day and they are clearly moving.  And people are moving here, but companies are expanding.  Yesterday I was with a technology company that is adding over 100 jobs just in technology.  But even the non-technology companies are moving here because of our technology.  Hertz, 700 jobs. Average income, $100,000.  People want to be here.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  They do, but you're doing something different recently because Florida has had those tremendous assets for a while, yet, when you took office the unemployment rate was 11.4 percent.  It is now down to 6.2.  So all those things have been in place.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  You're right, we've changed.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Yeah, what have you changed recently because other states should follow your example I would think?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  In the four years before I came into office, the state lost 832,000 jobs.  Unemployment went from 3.5 to 11.1 percent.  So, right after I got elected I sat down with site selectors from around the country and said here is why you should come to Florida.  And they said, you know, we don't talk to Florida.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Why?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  And that has completely changed.  We're talking to them now and saying what do your clients need?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  But why?  What was the reason? Why did they say they didn't talk to Florida before?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Well, they said that last administration wouldn't return their phone calls.  Wasn't focused, took forever, if you were even interested in making a decision.  So I sat down with them.  I said, here's my cell number.  Call me directly.  I will solve every problem I can.  Plus, in the meantime, we've cut taxes 24 times in three years.  This year we'll cut taxes $500 million.  I've cut about 3,000 regulations.  We've streamlined the permitting process.  And we just do what I did in business.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Jacksonville, for example, becoming a big hub for startups.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Yeah.    </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  In 2013 there was a big crowd funding event that drew 130,000 attendees.  20 percent came from out-of-state.  Is Jacksonville the next big tech center, the same way that we have heard about Austin and, of course, we know about Silicon Valley and we are hearing about places in the Midwest?  Is Jacksonville really hot?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Jacksonville is hot.  But you know, Gainesville, Orlando, Tampa.  We're going to have - I think the biggest Hispanic technology conference ever in the world is going to be in Miami in May.  So people want to be here.  We've got great young people.  We've got great universities, great state colleges.  They want to be here to build their companies.  We already have the third most number of technology companies in the country in Florida.  So we are the next, the whole state is the next Silicon Valley.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Is it essential to be tech focused?  I mean I keep hearing you say that you have I.T. professionals that are trained.  If another state is watching this and wanting to follow in your footsteps, is it essential that you have that tech component and the tech training?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Oh, I think it is very important.  But what I'm working on is to make sure universities and state colleges are graduating the students for the future.  Where are all the jobs going, that's the degrees we're going to focus on and then continue to recruit companies that are already here to expand?  Make sure they stay here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  Because other governors are trying to recruit like I am. We're just going to try to do it better than anyone else.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  You've got me convinced.  I'm ready to open the Fox Business bureau right on the beach.  I can't wait ...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  You would love it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FRANCIS</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SCOTT</emphasis>:  All right, have a great day.    </p><p>      (END VIDEOTAPE)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BMK-PF71-F15W-H1TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

It's a list that's grown to nearly 500 people in the almost two decades since the Top 25 program began.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are usually several chief information officers on the list, and this year is no exception. Ed Toner is the state chief information officer for the state of Nebraska, a role he's held for about four years now. During that time, he led a massive consolidation of IT infrastructure and personnel, and he did it without a mandate. And Toner counts a significant cohort of millennial employees among his IT team. They run his content management system and they've been instrumental in helping introduce agile development methods (and bidding farewell to waterfall) throughout the enterprise.</p><p>This year's Top 25 list also includes a fairly new title that's creeping into many organizational charts, that of chief privacy officer. As states and cities across the country grapple with how to safeguard citizen data while still taking advantage of smart city technologies, many are looking at the emerging privacy practice led by Seattle Chief Privacy Officer Ginger Armbruster. She thinks a national privacy policy akin to the European Union's GDPR is likely the best course. But in the meantime, Armbruster is building a team that incorporates privacy considerations into everything the city does.</p><p>Audio Index (Time Stamps):</p><p>* Growing your own agile development team of millennials who code @ 1:58.</p><p>* Organic agile training after they come out of college and join your team @ 3:45.</p><p>* Stronger privacy protections in the embrace of smart city technologies @ 6:05.</p><p>* Public records and privacy: what we should not know @ 8:30.</p><p>* Sorry, states and locals, the EU GDPR may make federal pre-emption the only path forward @ 10:25.</p><p>* What gov tech startups often miss about privacy in their business models -- less is often more and the legal landscape is fraught @ 11:35.</p><p>* Dustin's Takeaways: On workforce (14:20) and privacy (14:55).</p><p>Transcript (Edited for Length and Clarity):</p><p>[Opening Billboard]</p><p>GovTech360: The Intersection of Government, Technology and the Future. Agile millennials cutting code for the future. And a distinctly European turn on privacy. We're making the pivots with two of the country's Doers, Dreamers and Drivers. All that on the premiere of a new podcast from Government Technology.</p><p>[Body]</p><p>Paul: From the Market Navigator Studios, I'm Paul Taylor with Government Technology Editor Noelle Knell. Hi there.</p><p>Noelle: Hi Paul, How are you?</p><p>Paul: Never better. On this debut episode of GovTech 360, we are tapping two of this year's Top 25 Doers, Dreamers and Drivers whose work is particularly on point. Picking favorites is hard. But we did it. Tell me about Favorite No. 1.</p><p>Noelle: It is hard enough narrowing the field down to 25, never mind just two, but as you said, we've chosen a couple whose body of work fits with the theme of the podcast. First up is Ed Toner, state CIO for Nebraska.</p><p>When appointed in 2015, he took on the heavy lifting common to many state CIOs -- enterprise consolidation, both technology and people. With that in the win column, doors are opening for him around town.</p><p>[Clip: Family Guy: \"Welcome to Boop. As our name suggests, our mainframe connects you and powers every server on the globe.\"]</p><p>Paul: Toner knew he couldn't compete with even made-up big names on the Internet. But as a brilliant episode of Family Guy suggests, he wanted what they had.</p><p>[Clip: Family Guy: \"Millennials crave things like instant gratification, authentic experiences, and for some reason we haven't figured out yet, improv comedy.\"]</p><p>Paul: With the help of a local college, Ed found millennials who were willing to delay gratification for an authentic experience in public service.</p><p>Noelle: His developers had way more work than they could handle. They already had a waterfall team and were fostering an agile team with a view to transitioning over time to all agile. It gave them lots of flexibility, just not enough capacity. Ed says they were way behind and were willing to make a deal -- with millennials who code and those who teach them.</p><p>SOT: Ed Toner: \"We didn't have enough talent to really fill the orders that we were getting for work. The state was, at that time, looking to automate and our tool helps in that automation. And we had about 20,000 hours of development that we were behind. We needed to get help and we needed it quickly. And so we went to the local community college. They helped us; they asked us about the curriculum that we would like to see. We are an agile development shop. And so we wanted him to get agile training and some of the basic programming skills. Then we brought him on as a special office staff, which meant they weren't an intern. They were actually paid very similar to an entry-level employee. And then within their goal, we, they knew was to become billable for us within six months. If they did, we brought him on board, to date. We brought in over 40.</p><p>Paul: I thought it was interesting that Ed realized he could not outsource all this agile goodness. Significantly too, the millennials were agile natives, and had no old skills to unlearn.</p><p>Noelle: That's exactly right. The partnership with the colleges was a great kickstart for the process, and provides a continuing pipeline for his shop. But Ed says you will need more training -- both technical and translation.</p><p>SOT Ed Toner: \"I think that's really my biggest advice is if you're going to go agile, make sure that you provide the training beyond what they receive at the college or the community college. We have coaches that we pay for to continue to educate our workforce. Now we're really at a point where it's starting to organically grow. So whenever an agile team is working with a waterfall team, the waterfall team has really adapted to the agile development, and not vice versa. Now it's actually bringing, being spread into those other Web development teams to adapt ... or adopt some of the techniques that are being used by the agile development teams. A lot of that is because, as you said, our agile development teams don't really understand the waterfall piece. So the waterfall chains have to adapt to the agile.</p><p>[Bridge and Reset]</p><p>Paul: We travel to the Northwest for Favorite No. 2 from Government Technology's Triple D's on the re-emergent issue of privacy, which casts a long shadow at the intersection of government, technology and the future. And there is someone in Seattle who is working to figure it out.</p><p>Noelle: Her name is Ginger Armbruster, named almost two years ago as Seattle's first Chief Privacy Officer, who has grown the city privacy program from the ground up, which defines how it collects, uses and disposes of personally identifiable information. That data, in aggregate form, is also the fuel of smart cities. I asked Armbruster about the tradeoffs.</p><p>SOT Noelle: \"You've talked about the potential privacy dangers and embracing certain smart cities technologies, a phenomenon where well-meaning people in government agree to quote unquote free digital services that are paid for in citizen data. Is there a way for cities to embrace smarter technologies while protecting citizen privacy?\"</p><p>SOT: Ginger Armbruster: \"I believe there is. And I think it starts with an acknowledgment that nothing is for free. So smart technology, certainly the tradeoff about employing it has to be weighed against what you do with all the information you're collecting. And I think acknowledging that and recognizing it's not just, 'Plug it in, then let's go,' like we might in our own homes, with Alexa and other technologies that we have to take into account that this isn't just our world. It's the public's information we're dealing with. When I sit down with different departments, part of the very first part of the conversation is, 'OK, what are we gonna do with the data we're collecting? What data do you need? Why do you need it?' And I believe there is a way to do this. It's just acknowledging that what you can collect and what you can get out of smart technologies is not necessarily what you want, at least as a city entity. You're going to have to find a way to recognize that privacy will be impacted if you give out all of the bike-share information. And give people's route information. I think we're seeing that playing out in L.A. right now around data and concerns about what does that mean if someone rents a scooter and I know everything about where they went that day. I think that that's the way that I approach it with everyone -- it's great technology. I certainly see the benefits for your mission. Let's talk about the data. How can we make this less invasive for folks? So they will want to embrace this technology so that you can now use privacy as a way to promote this technology beyond just the benefits for whatever you're trying to accomplish. That's how I approach it.</p><p>Paul: The way that Ambruster approaches it in 2019 is different than it would have been a decade ago. Then, every transaction began and ended with a paper form. Of course now, public records include all the data extracted from devices -- particularly phones -- used to unlock bike shares, pay parking meters and conduct most any other kind of transaction that takes place voluntarily on an app.</p><p>But you told me she is also thinking about personal data that comes from involuntary encounters between residents and their government.</p><p>Noelle: Yes, people are often compelled to give up information about themselves in exchange for public services. Again, Ginger says there are sensitive tradeoffs to be navigated here.</p><p>SOT: Ginger Armbruster: \"And then this issue of public records, I think, I don't want to have that be misinterpreted as lack of transparency at the government level. What it is for me is we should know everything government is up to, but we shouldn't know everything about the people who get those services. I shouldn't necessarily be able to see all the private details of people getting services from the city. Because when you get a service from the city of Seattle, you're either having a really bad day, you're having a medical emergency or maybe you've interacted with our police for some reason or you need services 'cause you're a member of a vulnerable community and you are needing services from your community. It seems to me that we collect too much, and that too much of that is available because of public records. That's the thing I'd like to see if there's something we can do something about.</p><p>Paul: Doing something about it means getting traction in a pretty fluid environment legislatively -- and one that, at the local level, is pretty squishy. That is thanks in no small part to the effects of the EU General Data Protection Regulation -- or GDPR as its now more commonly known.</p><p>Now a year old, it covers data and privacy in the European Union, and beyond. The export provisions of GDPR touch companies that do business in Europe. And with the Internet, that is a large universe of companies, including most American companies.</p><p>Ginger spoke hopefully about the Washington state privacy bill during the interview. Lucas Ropek from your staff followed the bill throughout the legislation session -- including the tussle between privacy rights advocates and big tech -- and chronicled the bill's collapse in closing days of the session. It's a really good read -- and we'll have a link to it in the show notes on govtech.com.</p><p>Noelle: Ginger doesn't think that cities -- or even states -- can do their own thing -- in the era of GDPR. She thinks that a national policy may be the only thing that keeps things coherent for international players based in the United States.</p><p>SOT: Ginger Armbruster: \"You know, we have a Washington state privacy act that's looking like it's probably going to be a little bit like the California one based on GDPR around data rights and the right to your information and the right to try, you know, all the things that you see in GDPR. And I don't think that's sustainable for companies that do business around the world, that have different small states have their own versions of this. I don't know how a Microsoft or an Amazon, you know -- that's a huge endeavor. How do I make sure California and Washington are both happy? Oh, something happening over here in Oregon, I believe that we're going to see the technology companies wanting to push for a federal legislation around this so that they have one set of rules. That's what I believe. And I believe that we've seen some of the large companies involved in some of the state activities, probably hoping to get these sort of in alignment.</p><p>\"I also think the large companies have simply said, 'We're making GDPR functional for everybody because we can't keep two different systems going.' I think, you know, in this worldwide marketplace and where there really are no boundaries, barriers and borders, I believe that's why we have to get to a common understanding of what is acceptable for doing business with an entity so that we're not in this sector-based regulatory situation with states running their own thing.</p><p>\"I don't know. I know that something is being looked at at the federal level right now, I don't know what the appetite is for that, with all the other things that are going on politically, but it seems to me that is a matter of just having a common landscape. That's what I think we're going to be heading to. And it seems to make sense to me.</p><p>\"Should we get to a place where we have a unified federal policy relative to data privacy? What should that look like? What do you think Americans have an appetite for based on your expertise in this area? Well, it's interesting, you know, I live in an area that's very privacy cognizant, right? And I have this viewpoint that says, I believe people want privacy protections. Although I also wonder sometimes if some of the more active privacy activists are maybe keeping us from moving forward on technologies that people have already accepted, I mean some of the things that we would say I would see very invasive. You know, some of the home systems that we have that are listening all the time.</p><p>\"What we're willing to put up with in the private sector, we are not willing to put up with in the public sector.</p><p>Noelle: And that is the dilemma right there. People have higher expectations of how their data is handled by government than by the private sector, where personal information can be used as a coupon to get a few cents off a roll of paper towels.</p><p>Paul: I think that difference is sometimes lost on gov tech startups whose founders may have backgrounds in retail, services or fintech. As we wrapped up with Ginger, we asked her about that too.</p><p>SOT: Ginger Armbruster: \"... the thing that I find from the privacy perspective is there are so many good ideas out there about how to make life better, right? Oh, how can I help the city and how can I -- I see a need and they're probably right on from the privacy perspective. What I want those companies to have done is their homework around the privacy and data policies. What do you do with the data you collect? Because so much of the business models are around, 'I'm going to collect data and I'm going to sell it over here. I'm gonna use it in this other way while I provide the service to the city that they need.' And that may be OK, but I need to be able to give answers to the questions.</p><p>\"What are you doing? I would love companies to come in with a clear idea of their data collection practices and what they're using the data for and their privacy policy. What do we protect and what are we doing so that I don't have to, I've been, I've been a couple of times asked to build somebody's privacy policy. That was sort of interesting. In my mind, I can't tell you your business model. You have to tell me, and I can't build you your privacy policies. You need to do that for me. I also want companies to understand that the legal landscape of the city there and state that they're in. We've had people come in who have no idea about our public records act and so they get really surprised when they find out that everything is public.</p><p>\"So we don't want all that information. You trying to tell us is a benefit. I actually prefer not to have it. Understanding the legal landscape both at the city level and at the state level so that they understand the privacy limitations that we have as they're promoting whatever they're promoting. And then I also think companies tend to go into the departments and get people sold on benefits, and that's great. I mean, I used to be a salesperson. That's certainly what you want to do, generate the interest to make sure you have some sponsor, but not waiting too long to get involved with the compliance side of the house. Right? Don't wait too long before you've talked to the privacy and security people. Don't wait too long before you realize they're going to be the ones who say, 'Nah, it's not gonna happen until I've had a chance to repeat you.' So there's a lot of delay that can happen. Someone's trying to sell something that can be a real disappointment and it can be a real tension. Get involved early with the legal side of the house. Make sure you've covered your bases on those compliance issues.</p><p>Paul: Noelle, Thanks for bringing both these guests to the table. As we said at the top, there is a total of 25 Dreamers, Doers and Drivers. How can listeners read more about the whole list and assuage our guilt about picking only two for the podcast?</p><p>Noelle: Yes, please go visit and read the profiles of all 25 at govtech.com. Search for \"Top 25\" to get the individual profiles, infographic and all kinds of interesting information that kind of sums up this group.</p><p>Paul: Noelle Knell, editor of Government Technology. Thank you very much.</p><p>Noelle: Thanks Paul.</p><p>Paul: Our colleague, co-host and chief Innovator, Dustin Haisler has been listening in. What did you hear in the conversation with Ed Toner?</p><p>Dustin: We've talked at length about this talent gap that exists in the public sector, and I think they've really shown in Nebraska that solving the talent gap requires creative approaches. And for them, that was going to a community college and partnering, and kind of using that as a resource to incubate talent. But this is something that agencies have to look beyond: just the benefits they provide. You know, a flexible work day is not going to get someone to come and work for you. You have to really look at going to where they're at and finding a way to incubate the talent there. And then eventually you can start to see the results like Nebraska has seen with getting talent to come back.</p><p>Paul: And what about the chat with Ginger and the privacy pivot?</p><p>Dustin: Her takeaways are really telling when it comes to what's just happening in the national landscape around privacy. And three things that stood out for me in her interview is No. 1, we have to start to think about designing for use. And so, she asked questions about what are we doing with the data that we're collecting? What data do you need? Why do you need it? How do we make it less invasive? These are all questions that should be asked as a part of any type of procurement process as we're -- you know, even before that -- as we're designing what solution we need to solve the problems that we have, we need to start to think about the role that data plays in that and how we design for data as you use it. The second thing that stood out is this unsolved challenge.</p><p>How do we extract what we know about people while providing them better service delivery? And so, you know, Ginger said she would love for companies to come in with a clear idea of their data collection practices and what they're using the data for and a robust privacy policy. And I think this is something that the market really needs to move on. Companies that are in the space need to start to think about helping government solve this challenge. How do we extract all of the personally identifiable information that's not necessary, but sometimes we still need to know as a part of the experience delivery while not creating risk in the process. And the third thing was that a more holistic approach to data regulation is coming and it's going to come first through state and local policy, which we've seen. And that's part of the reason why we're seeing chief privacy officers pop up at the state level and city level across the country, but eventually through a national policy, which could be a U.S. equivalent of GDPR. Agencies today really need to be thinking about and preparing their data management practices for the inevitable rise of additional regulations as it relates to government's role in this whole process.</p><p>Paul: That's helpful, as always, Dustin. What are you working on?</p><p>Dustin: Cutting through the marketing hype cycle of the shiny objects and into how we can practically use technology data, new processes to solve real problems in government.</p><p>Paul: Thanks, man. We will explore those later in the season on GovTech 360.</p><p>Connect with us on Twitter. Noelle is @GovTechNoelle, Dustin is @dustinhaisler.

Non-compliance could land you in jail for seven years. On the top of that would be a fine of up to '. 100 crore.</p><p>BJP MP Tarun Vijay , who has long been campaigning for such a law, said \"patriotic Indians\" should use the country's own 'Bhuvan' software application for maps. \"Why do we need Google? We should stop becoming Google's instruments,\" he told ET. \"The patriotic government of <person><nameText>Narendra Modi </nameText></person>has taken a right step in a big relief to the security establishment. UPA did not take any action despite my pleas to the then defence Minister AK Antony . I congratulate the Modi government for showing spine in face of</p><p>arrogance of these IT giants,\" he said, adding: Googlehas been \"behaving as if it were above Indian law\".</p><p>A top government official involved in the move said maps of India's sensitive installations were available on GoogleMaps, increasing the security risk of those sites. Demand to mask those were never complied to.\"Pathankot air base, which was recently attacked, can be seen on GoogleMaps. Terrorists plot strikes on sensitive targets studying GoogleMaps,\" he told ET. \"Our plea to black out sensitive installations do not yield results. This Bill is now sending a strong message that US companies cannot be running roughshod over Indian security interests.\"</p><p>Companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple, which have millions of Indians using their maps, would be hit directly by the legislation if it is pushed through. Firms that depend on these maps to provide their services, such as Uber, Zomato and Ola, too would be affected. Google, Apple and Microsoftdidn't respond to emails seeking comment.</p><p>Mishi Choudhary , legal director at Software Freedom Law Centre, said almost all online</p><p>businesses to day depend on geo-location and provide maps for the use of their servi ces, and that all of them will be forced to seek a licence under the proposed law. \"This kind of digital natio nalism is a way to create a go</p><p>vernment-controlled monopoly on all geographical information about the country , conveniently transforming Digital India to Licence India, digitally this time,\" said Choudhary , who was part of the successful legal fight to scrap Section 66A of the IT Act to ensure freedom of expression on the Internet.</p><p>An executive at one of the big tech companies said the draft Bill raised far too many questions. \"On the face of it, the Bill will kill any and every use of the maps. It is also unclear if you get a licence for maps, only you can use it or others can use it, too,\" he said. \"Also, whether every time you update a map, does one have to get a security clearance? Maps have to be live and dynamic, so getting it approved from government each time may not be feasible.\"</p><p>Those working on mapping and geospatial technology said services such as GoogleMaps are popular because they are faster and easier to use compared to government-prescribed process. \"According to Indian law...if I have to buy certain data, I will have to go to the concerned department, like ISRO's National Remote Sensing Agency , or the Survey of India.In the case of NRSA (for satellite data), they will purchase the data for me, and then I will have to pay . That's a long process and hence people went to services like GoogleMaps, which are easier,\" said Devdatta Tengshe, a freelance geospatial information systems consultant. The agency removes sensitive zones from the data and takes about two-three months or even more to respond, which is an unrealistic timeline for people working with digital data, he said.</p><p>There is also apprehension that the Bill will undermine rescue and humanitarian efforts, such as during disasters like the Nepal earthquake. \"It was user-generated geospatial data that was used by the humanitarian response teams.This situation of lack of openly usable geospatial data holds true for large parts of India, and especially Himalayan India,\" said Sumandro Chattapadhyay , research director at Centre for Internet and Society. Also of concern is the lack of court's jurisdiction in matters related to the proposed legislation, said SFLC's Choudhary .</p><p>A senior official, however, said companies should not have a problem to come under regulations on security considerations. \"We are not banning anyone from mapping India -only that the mapping has to be in line with Indian security considerations regarding sensitive installations and correct boundaries being depicted. \" this official said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOTEP-0_14_09052016001045</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOTEP2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JR6-N5J1-DXJR-H2HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382887</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">__________</p><p>GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits.</p><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve created a lending facility to buy short-term loans from banks and companies to ease the flow of credit as the economy grinds to a halt. The Fed announced Tuesday that it's reviving a program it first used during the 2008 financial crisis to unclog a short-term lending market for what is known as \"commercial paper.\" Large businesses issue commercial paper to raise cash to meet payrolls and cover other short-term costs. Borrowing rates in the commercial paper market have been spiking as more companies have sought to raise cash in the expectation that their revenue will plunge.</p><p>The White House is proposing a roughly $850 billion emergency economic rescue package for businesses and taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will outline the package to Senate Republicans at a private lunch, with officials aiming to have Congress approve it this week. It provide relief for small businesses and the airline industry and include a massive tax cut for wage-earners. Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The British government has unveiled a massive economic support package that it hopes will contain some of the damage of the coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government will \"act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support the economy.\" Among a raft of measures, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said the government would provide a 330 billion pounds ($405 billion) worth of government-backed loans and guarantees for small and large businesses, which is equivalent to 15% of the country's annual GDP. He said the scheme should be up and running by the start of next week.</p><p>Spain will mobilize 200 billion euros or the equivalent to one fifth of the country's annual output in loans, credit guarantees and subsidies for workers and vulnerable citizens, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday.</p><p>Greece will provide 2 billion euros to help businesses hit by a loss of revenue due to the conronavirus outbreak, while the state will pay part of employees' salaries in affected sectors.</p><p>France's government pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures.</p><p>The Dutch government has announced a multibillion-euro (dollar) raft of measures to prop up businesses and workers hit by the coronavirus and the restrictive measures put in place to slow its spread. The support package includes paying up to 90% of the salaries of staff at businesses hit by the virus for the next three months, financial support for the self-employed and making it easier to delay paying taxes.</p><p>Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms</p><p>New Zealand vowed Tuesday to spend billions of dollars supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP.</p><p>Venezuela is seeking an emergency $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, appealing to an institution it has long denounced to cope with the fallout from the new coronavirus on its already collapsed oil economy.</p><p>STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: The places that we once gathered, save for public areas, are now largely closed. That number of retailers, national fast food chains movie theaters and malls that are locking their doors continues to grow.</p><p>Apple said over the weekend that it would close all of its stores until March 27. It said Tuesday that those stores will remain closed indefinitely.</p><p>McDonald's and Wendy's say the dining areas of all North American restaurants are closing. Takeout or delivery is still available at most locations, though some chains have declared out an outright shutdown in areas where clusters of coronavirus have emerged, including Starbucks. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that dining areas in France are closed. In Spain and Italy, both hard hit by COVID-19, all restaurants are completely closed. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open.</p><p>The Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, will close Tuesday and its doors will remain locked until at least April.</p><p>Food delivery company DoorDash is waiving fees for restaurants, hiring out-of-work waiters and delivering food to the needy as the new coronavirus radically changes the restaurant industry. The San Francisco company will allow independent restaurants sign up for its delivery service for free through the end of April.</p><p>Ralph Lauren and Foot Locker announced nationwide closures of stores in regulatory filings. They follow Patagonia, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, REI and others in doing so.</p><p>With so many people stocking, and overstocking pantries, Dollar Tree temporarily suspended online ordering to ensure the shelves in its stores are loaded.</p><p>U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed upcoming releases, including the new James Bond film. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close.</p><p>BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are banding together to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>Facebook says it is giving $100 million in grants - cash and advertising credits - to small businesses to help them during the coronavirus.</p><p>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: Amazon, in an attempt to fill its warehouses with toilet paper, hand sanitizer and other items in high demand, said Tuesday that it will limit what suppliers can send to its warehouses for the next three weeks. Among the items that suppliers and third-party sellers can ship to Amazon include canned beans, diapers, dog food, disinfecting wipes, medical supplies and household goods. Items like jeans, phone cases and other non-essentials will not be allowed.</p><p>HEAVY INDUSTRY: Ford Motor Co. will shut down all of its vehicle and engine factories in Europe starting Thursday to help contain the coronavirus and because sales are down and parts are running short. The company expects the shutdown to last for a number of weeks, but reopening depends on spread of the virus, national restrictions, parts supplies and dealer stock requirements.</p><p>The U.S. factories for Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler remain in operation, but some members of the United Auto Workers union are trying to get the companies to close them soon to help stop the virus from spreading.</p><p>Volkswagen announced the closing of most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts.</p><p>Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers.</p><p>TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April.</p><p>Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22.</p><p>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways cut its flight schedule by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago.</p><p>American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.</p><p>Southwest Airlines says it is temporarily cutting back on serving snacks and drinks because of the coronavirus outbreak. The airline said Tuesday it has dropped all such service on flights under 250 miles, and starting Wednesday it will offer only snacks and unopened water cans on longer flights to limit the number of objects touched by individuals.</p><p>MARKETS: Stocks jumped Tuesday as President Donald Trump promised he's \"going big\" with plans to blunt the economic pain caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Markets around the world remain highly volatile as traders see a recession growing more likely, if it hasn't begun already. Tuesday's 6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 meant it clawed back a little less than half of its Monday decline, its biggest in more than three decades.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets will stay open for people to access their money during the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin said at a White House briefing Tuesday that shorter hours may still be necessary. But he says banks and other institutions will not shut down as the U.S. grapples with the pandemic.</p><p>DOWNWARD SLOPE: Vail Resorts will close all slopes for the remainder of the ski season. The company announced Saturday that it would shut down its 34 resorts for at least one week.</p><p>HOTEL HEARTBREAK: Jon Bortz, CEO of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which owns 54 hotels in major cities including New York, San Francisco and Seattle, said occupancy levels have dropped into the single digits. The company has laid off more than 4,000 of its 8,000 employees, and is likely to let go another 2,000 by the end of March, he said. \"We are looking at closing the doors at more than half of our properties,\" he said. Chip Rogers, president of the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, said the hotel industry has already suffered more damage than caused by 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis combined.</p><p>_______</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">__________</p><p>GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits.</p><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve created a lending facility to buy short-term loans from banks and companies to ease the flow of credit as the economy grinds to a halt. The Fed announced Tuesday that it's reviving a program it first used during the 2008 financial crisis to unclog a short-term lending market for what is known as \"commercial paper.\" Large businesses issue commercial paper to raise cash to meet payrolls and cover other short-term costs. Borrowing rates in the commercial paper market have been spiking as more companies have sought to raise cash in the expectation that their revenue will plunge.</p><p>The White House is proposing a roughly $850 billion emergency economic rescue package for businesses and taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will outline the package to Senate Republicans at a private lunch, with officials aiming to have Congress approve it this week. It provide relief for small businesses and the airline industry and include a massive tax cut for wage-earners. Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The British government has unveiled a massive economic support package that it hopes will contain some of the damage of the coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government will \"act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support the economy.\" Among a raft of measures, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said the government would provide a 330 billion pounds ($405 billion) worth of government-backed loans and guarantees for small and large businesses, which is equivalent to 15% of the country's annual GDP. He said the scheme should be up and running by the start of next week.</p><p>Spain will mobilize 200 billion euros or the equivalent to one fifth of the country's annual output in loans, credit guarantees and subsidies for workers and vulnerable citizens, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday.</p><p>Greece will provide 2 billion euros to help businesses hit by a loss of revenue due to the conronavirus outbreak, while the state will pay part of employees' salaries in affected sectors.</p><p>France's government pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures.</p><p>The Dutch government has announced a multibillion-euro (dollar) raft of measures to prop up businesses and workers hit by the coronavirus and the restrictive measures put in place to slow its spread. The support package includes paying up to 90% of the salaries of staff at businesses hit by the virus for the next three months, financial support for the self-employed and making it easier to delay paying taxes.</p><p>Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms</p><p>New Zealand vowed Tuesday to spend billions of dollars supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP.</p><p>Venezuela is seeking an emergency $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, appealing to an institution it has long denounced to cope with the fallout from the new coronavirus on its already collapsed oil economy.</p><p>STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: The places that we once gathered, save for public areas, are now largely closed. That number of retailers, national fast food chains movie theaters and malls that are locking their doors continues to grow.</p><p>Apple said over the weekend that it would close all of its stores until March 27. It said Tuesday that those stores will remain closed indefinitely.</p><p>McDonald's and Wendy's say the dining areas of all North American restaurants are closing. Takeout or delivery is still available at most locations, though some chains have declared out an outright shutdown in areas where clusters of coronavirus have emerged, including Starbucks. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that dining areas in France are closed. In Spain and Italy, both hard hit by COVID-19, all restaurants are completely closed. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open.</p><p>The Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, will close Tuesday and its doors will remain locked until at least April.</p><p>Food delivery company DoorDash is waiving fees for restaurants, hiring out-of-work waiters and delivering food to the needy as the new coronavirus radically changes the restaurant industry. The San Francisco company will allow independent restaurants sign up for its delivery service for free through the end of April.</p><p>Ralph Lauren and Foot Locker announced nationwide closures of stores in regulatory filings. They follow Patagonia, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, REI and others in doing so.</p><p>With so many people stocking, and overstocking pantries, Dollar Tree temporarily suspended online ordering to ensure the shelves in its stores are loaded.</p><p>U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed upcoming releases, including the new James Bond film. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close.</p><p>BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are banding together to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>Facebook says it is giving $100 million in grants - cash and advertising credits - to small businesses to help them during the coronavirus.</p><p>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: Amazon, in an attempt to fill its warehouses with toilet paper, hand sanitizer and other items in high demand, said Tuesday that it will limit what suppliers can send to its warehouses for the next three weeks. Among the items that suppliers and third-party sellers can ship to Amazon include canned beans, diapers, dog food, disinfecting wipes, medical supplies and household goods. Items like jeans, phone cases and other non-essentials will not be allowed.</p><p>HEAVY INDUSTRY: Ford Motor Co. will shut down all of its vehicle and engine factories in Europe starting Thursday to help contain the coronavirus and because sales are down and parts are running short. The company expects the shutdown to last for a number of weeks, but reopening depends on spread of the virus, national restrictions, parts supplies and dealer stock requirements.</p><p>The U.S. factories for Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler remain in operation, but some members of the United Auto Workers union are trying to get the companies to close them soon to help stop the virus from spreading.</p><p>Volkswagen announced the closing of most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts.</p><p>Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers.</p><p>TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April.</p><p>Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22.</p><p>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways cut its flight schedule by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago.</p><p>American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.</p><p>Southwest Airlines says it is temporarily cutting back on serving snacks and drinks because of the coronavirus outbreak. The airline said Tuesday it has dropped all such service on flights under 250 miles, and starting Wednesday it will offer only snacks and unopened water cans on longer flights to limit the number of objects touched by individuals.</p><p>MARKETS: Stocks jumped Tuesday as President Donald Trump promised he's \"going big\" with plans to blunt the economic pain caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Markets around the world remain highly volatile as traders see a recession growing more likely, if it hasn't begun already. Tuesday's 6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 meant it clawed back a little less than half of its Monday decline, its biggest in more than three decades.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets will stay open for people to access their money during the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin said at a White House briefing Tuesday that shorter hours may still be necessary. But he says banks and other institutions will not shut down as the U.S. grapples with the pandemic.</p><p>DOWNWARD SLOPE: Vail Resorts will close all slopes for the remainder of the ski season. The company announced Saturday that it would shut down its 34 resorts for at least one week.</p><p>HOTEL HEARTBREAK: Jon Bortz, CEO of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which owns 54 hotels in major cities including New York, San Francisco and Seattle, said occupancy levels have dropped into the single digits. The company has laid off more than 4,000 of its 8,000 employees, and is likely to let go another 2,000 by the end of March, he said. \"We are looking at closing the doors at more than half of our properties,\" he said. Chip Rogers, president of the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, said the hotel industry has already suffered more damage than caused by 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis combined.</p><p>_______</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">__________</p><p>GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits.</p><p>The U.S. Federal Reserve created a lending facility to buy short-term loans from banks and companies to ease the flow of credit as the economy grinds to a halt. The Fed announced Tuesday that it's reviving a program it first used during the 2008 financial crisis to unclog a short-term lending market for what is known as \"commercial paper.\" Large businesses issue commercial paper to raise cash to meet payrolls and cover other short-term costs. Borrowing rates in the commercial paper market have been spiking as more companies have sought to raise cash in the expectation that their revenue will plunge.</p><p>The White House is proposing a roughly $850 billion emergency economic rescue package for businesses and taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will outline the package to Senate Republicans at a private lunch, with officials aiming to have Congress approve it this week. It provide relief for small businesses and the airline industry and include a massive tax cut for wage-earners. Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.</p><p>The British government has unveiled a massive economic support package that it hopes will contain some of the damage of the coronavirus outbreak. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his government will \"act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support the economy.\" Among a raft of measures, Treasury chief Rishi Sunak said the government would provide a 330 billion pounds ($405 billion) worth of government-backed loans and guarantees for small and large businesses, which is equivalent to 15% of the country's annual GDP. He said the scheme should be up and running by the start of next week.</p><p>Spain will mobilize 200 billion euros or the equivalent to one fifth of the country's annual output in loans, credit guarantees and subsidies for workers and vulnerable citizens, Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced Tuesday.</p><p>Greece will provide 2 billion euros to help businesses hit by a loss of revenue due to the conronavirus outbreak, while the state will pay part of employees' salaries in affected sectors.</p><p>France's government pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures.</p><p>The Dutch government has announced a multibillion-euro (dollar) raft of measures to prop up businesses and workers hit by the coronavirus and the restrictive measures put in place to slow its spread. The support package includes paying up to 90% of the salaries of staff at businesses hit by the virus for the next three months, financial support for the self-employed and making it easier to delay paying taxes.</p><p>Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms</p><p>New Zealand vowed Tuesday to spend billions of dollars supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP.</p><p>Venezuela is seeking an emergency $5 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund, appealing to an institution it has long denounced to cope with the fallout from the new coronavirus on its already collapsed oil economy.</p><p>STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: The places that we once gathered, save for public areas, are now largely closed. That number of retailers, national fast food chains movie theaters and malls that are locking their doors continues to grow.</p><p>Apple said over the weekend that it would close all of its stores until March 27. It said Tuesday that those stores will remain closed indefinitely.</p><p>McDonald's and Wendy's say the dining areas of all North American restaurants are closing. Takeout or delivery is still available at most locations, though some chains have declared out an outright shutdown in areas where clusters of coronavirus have emerged, including Starbucks. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that dining areas in France are closed. In Spain and Italy, both hard hit by COVID-19, all restaurants are completely closed. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open.</p><p>The Mall of America, the nation's largest shopping mall, will close Tuesday and its doors will remain locked until at least April.</p><p>Food delivery company DoorDash is waiving fees for restaurants, hiring out-of-work waiters and delivering food to the needy as the new coronavirus radically changes the restaurant industry. The San Francisco company will allow independent restaurants sign up for its delivery service for free through the end of April.</p><p>Ralph Lauren and Foot Locker announced nationwide closures of stores in regulatory filings. They follow Patagonia, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, REI and others in doing so.</p><p>With so many people stocking, and overstocking pantries, Dollar Tree temporarily suspended online ordering to ensure the shelves in its stores are loaded.</p><p>U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed upcoming releases, including the new James Bond film. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close.</p><p>BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are banding together to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.</p><p>Facebook says it is giving $100 million in grants - cash and advertising credits - to small businesses to help them during the coronavirus.</p><p>SUPPLY AND DEMAND: Amazon, in an attempt to fill its warehouses with toilet paper, hand sanitizer and other items in high demand, said Tuesday that it will limit what suppliers can send to its warehouses for the next three weeks. Among the items that suppliers and third-party sellers can ship to Amazon include canned beans, diapers, dog food, disinfecting wipes, medical supplies and household goods. Items like jeans, phone cases and other non-essentials will not be allowed.</p><p>HEAVY INDUSTRY: Ford Motor Co. will shut down all of its vehicle and engine factories in Europe starting Thursday to help contain the coronavirus and because sales are down and parts are running short. The company expects the shutdown to last for a number of weeks, but reopening depends on spread of the virus, national restrictions, parts supplies and dealer stock requirements.</p><p>The U.S. factories for Ford, General Motors and FiatChrysler remain in operation, but some members of the United Auto Workers union are trying to get the companies to close them soon to help stop the virus from spreading.</p><p>Volkswagen announced the closing of most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts.</p><p>Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers.</p><p>TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April.</p><p>Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22.</p><p>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways cut its flight schedule by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago.</p><p>American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.</p><p>Southwest Airlines says it is temporarily cutting back on serving snacks and drinks because of the coronavirus outbreak. The airline said Tuesday it has dropped all such service on flights under 250 miles, and starting Wednesday it will offer only snacks and unopened water cans on longer flights to limit the number of objects touched by individuals.</p><p>MARKETS: Stocks jumped Tuesday as President Donald Trump promised he's \"going big\" with plans to blunt the economic pain caused by the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>Markets around the world remain highly volatile as traders see a recession growing more likely, if it hasn't begun already. Tuesday's 6% gain for the S&amp;P 500 meant it clawed back a little less than half of its Monday decline, its biggest in more than three decades.</p><p>Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says financial markets will stay open for people to access their money during the coronavirus outbreak. Mnuchin said at a White House briefing Tuesday that shorter hours may still be necessary. But he says banks and other institutions will not shut down as the U.S. grapples with the pandemic.</p><p>DOWNWARD SLOPE: Vail Resorts will close all slopes for the remainder of the ski season. The company announced Saturday that it would shut down its 34 resorts for at least one week.</p><p>HOTEL HEARTBREAK: Jon Bortz, CEO of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, which owns 54 hotels in major cities including New York, San Francisco and Seattle, said occupancy levels have dropped into the single digits. The company has laid off more than 4,000 of its 8,000 employees, and is likely to let go another 2,000 by the end of March, he said. \"We are looking at closing the doors at more than half of our properties,\" he said. Chip Rogers, president of the American Hotel &amp; Lodging Association, said the hotel industry has already suffered more damage than caused by 9/11 and the 2008 financial crisis combined.</p><p>_______</p><p>The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced strong restrictions on freedom of movement in a bid to counter the new coronavirus, as the European Union closed its external borders to foreign travelers. For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms. For some it can cause more severe illness. </p><p>(AP Photo/Christophe Ena)Governments and central banks are scrambling to find ways to keep businesses from going bankrupt as the virus outbreak grinds the world economy to a halt. A day after Wall Street endured its worst daily drop since the crash of 1987, European markets wavered, as did U.S futures markets. There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.  Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding. __________ GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: The White House is proposing a roughly $850 billion emergency economic rescue package for businesses and taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will outline the package to Senate Republicans at a private lunch, with officials aiming to have Congress approve it this week. It provide relief for small businesses and the airline industry and include a massive tax cut for wage-earners. Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. France's government pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the new aid will include tax breaks and a \"solidarity fund\" for struggling small businesses. \"This epidemic will be a catastrophe for all countries of the world,\" he said. 'The shock will be violent.' Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits. (Ad) I've found a company with a marijuana profit-sharing plan that's 100% backed by the U.S. Federal Government. Out of 4,000 publicly traded stocks, this is the only one of its kind. And it will give you the opportunity to collect up to $55,563 from the legal marijuana boom. Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms New Zealand vowed Tuesday to spend billions of dollars supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP. A large chunk of the new spending will go to businesses that have lost more than 30% of their income as a result of the downturn. Other money will go toward health costs, income support, and the airline industry. BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are banding together to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. HEAVY INDUSTRY: Volkswagen said it will close most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts. Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said Tuesday that uncertainty about the severity and duration of the virus outbreak made it impossible to give a reliable outlook for sales.  Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers. TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April. Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says now is the time for Canadians to come home. The government has mandated the screening of passengers by airlines before boarding. Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways cut its flight schedule by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago. Hong Kong's airlines were already under pressure because of political unrest which has hurt tourism.  American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.  MARKETS: U.S. stocks jittered higher at the start of trading Tuesday, a day after plunging to their worst loss in more than three decades, as uncertainty about how badly the coronavirus will hit the economy continues to dominate markets. Trading is unsettled around the world beyond the S&amp;P 500, where an initial gain of 3.2% trimmed to 1% within 10 minutes. European stocks swung from gains to losses. South Korean stocks fell to their fifth straight loss of 2.5%, but Japanese stocks shook off an early loss to edge higher.  The 12% plunge on the S&amp;P 500 Monday took place amid a growing consensus, from Wall Street to the White House, that a global recession may be imminent. Entire sectors of national economies are at risk. The Philippine stock market shut down Tuesday after the government imposed restrictions on movement in the capital. The investor-oriented ZEW index of German business confidence recorded its sharpest decline ever as Europe's economy faces an almost certain recession whose depth could exceed the one that followed the global financial crisis. The index fell to minus 49.5 points in March from plus 8.7 points in February, a fall of 58.2 points and the biggest drop since the survey began in 1991, the institute said Tuesday. Germany and other countries are restricting entry at the border and ordering many businesses to close, leading to a massive drop in sales and activity across Europe.  STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: The closure list of retailers, national fast food chains or any place where people once congregated continued to grow Tuesday. McDonald's and Wendy's say the dining areas of all North American restaurants are closing. Takeout or delivery is still available at most locations, though some chains have declared out an outright shutdown in areas where clusters of coronavirus have emerged, including Starbucks. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that dining areas in France are closed. In Spain and Italy, both hard hit by COVID-19, all restaurants have locked their doors. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open.  Ralph Lauren and Foot Locker announced nationwide closures of stores in regulatory filings. They follow Patagonia, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, REI and others in doing so.  With so many people stocking, and overstocking pantries, Dollar Tree temporarily suspended online ordering to ensure the shelves in its stores are loaded. Like Amazon, Target and Walmart, Dollar Tree has experienced a sharp spike in online orders as consumers scramble to secure staples while avoiding public places. Dollar Tree said most of the items on its website are still available in stores. With hopes of a rescue fading in a pandemic, the London fashion and furniture retailer Laura Ashley said Tuesday that it will appoint administrators to devise its direction going forward. The company's main shareholder MUI Asia said it will not be able to step in with the money that is needed. The company, which was an iconic presence on the U.K. high street during the 1980s, said in a prepared statement that the outbreak has had 'an immediate and significant impact,' and that 'ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation.\" U.S. movie theaters have closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed upcoming releases, including the new James Bond film. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close.  _______ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

There is tremendous volatility, with the extent of economic damage from the pandemic still anyone's guess. Factories are closed, retail stores are closed, travel has ground almost to a halt and billions of people are sheltering at home, going outside only to find essential supplies.</p><p><br/>Here is a look at how the outbreak is reshaping the global economy and how individuals, businesses and governments are responding.<br/>GOVERNMENT AND CENTRAL BANKS: The White House is proposing a roughly $850 billion emergency economic rescue package for businesses and taxpayers. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will outline the package to Senate Republicans at a private lunch, with officials aiming to have Congress approve it this week. It provide relief for small businesses and the airline industry and include a massive tax cut for wage-earners. Two people familiar with the request described it to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly.<br/>France's government pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in aid for small businesses. That's in addition to tens of billions already promised for French workers forced to stop working because of store and restaurant closures and strict new confinement measures. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire announced the new aid will include tax breaks and a \"solidarity fund\" for struggling small businesses. \"This epidemic will be a catastrophe for all countries of the world,\" he said. \"The shock will be violent.\"<br/>Where to begin is an enormously complex question. Big industry and small business are looking at a complete, or nearly complete halt to operations. Restaurants that have been shuttered employ hundreds of thousands of people. Airlines are grounding flights, meaning no crews are needed. The dilemma afflicts every sector of the national and global economy. The risk of frozen economic activity will ripple outward, from the banking and mortgage industry, to services ranging from dog walking to doctors visits.<br/>Sweden's central bank will buy securities for up to an additional 300 billion kronor ($31 billion) and offer more loans to banks on favourable terms<br/>New Zealand vowed Tuesday to\u00a0spend billions of dollars\u00a0supporting distressed companies with its economy headed for recession. The stimulus package is equivalent to 4% of GDP. A large chunk of the new spending will go to businesses that have lost more than 30% of their income as a result of the downturn. Other money will go toward health costs, income support, and the airline industry.<br/>BIG TECH: The biggest tech companies in the world are\u00a0banding together\u00a0to combat misinformation about the pandemic and also fraud. Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Linkedin, Reddit and YouTube said in a joint statement that they will also attempt to disseminate across their platforms essential updates from government health organizations. Misinformation and confusion in social media posts have been problematic for years. The spread of the coronavirus has exacerbated the problems for which Facebook and others were lambasted during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.<br/>HEAVY INDUSTRY:\u00a0Volkswagen\u00a0said it will close most of its European plants for two weeks due to uncertainty about demand for cars and supplies of parts. Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said Tuesday that uncertainty about the severity and duration of the virus outbreak made it impossible to give a reliable outlook for sales.<br/>Airbus will suspend production at its French and Spanish facilities for the next four days to implement tougher health and safety protocols, including more rigorous sanitation and enforced distancing between workers.<br/>TRAVEL: Qantas, Australia's largest airline, and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways both cut international passenger capacity by 90%. Qantas's cuts will last until the end of May, Cathay Pacific's apply in April.<br/>Canada's second largest airline is suspending all commercial international and transborder flights for a 30-day period as it helps operate rescue and repatriation flights in partnership with the Canadian government. Westjet says it will suspend normal service on Sunday, March 22. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says now is the time for Canadians to come home. The government has mandated the screening of passengers by airlines before boarding.<br/>Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways\u00a0cut its flight schedule\u00a0by 90% in April after passenger traffic in February fell by more than half from a year ago. Hong Kong's airlines were already under pressure because of political unrest which has hurt tourism.<br/>American Airlines on Monday suspended about 75% of its long-haul international flights and began grounding about 135 planes. It will cut passenger-carrying capacity in the U.S. by 20% in April and 30% in May. Airlines are talking to unions about taking cuts in pay or hours, and some are cutting executive and management salaries.<br/>MARKETS: U.S. stocks\u00a0jittered higher\u00a0at the start of trading Tuesday, a day after plunging to their worst loss in more than three decades, as uncertainty about how badly the coronavirus will hit the economy continues to dominate markets.<br/>Trading is unsettled around the world beyond the S&amp;P 500, where an initial gain of 3.2% trimmed to 1% within 10 minutes. European stocks swung from gains to losses. South Korean stocks fell to their fifth straight loss of 2.5%, but Japanese stocks shook off an early loss to edge higher.<br/>The 12% plunge on the S&amp;P 500 Monday took place amid a growing consensus, from Wall Street to the White House, that a global recession may be imminent. Entire sectors of national economies are at risk. The Philippine stock market shut down Tuesday after the government imposed restrictions on movement in the capital.<br/>The investor-oriented ZEW index of German business confidence recorded its sharpest decline ever as Europe's economy faces an almost certain recession whose depth could exceed the one that followed the global financial crisis. The index fell to minus 49.5 points in March from plus 8.7 points in February, a fall of 58.2 points and the biggest drop since the survey began in 1991, the institute said Tuesday. Germany and other countries are restricting entry at the border and ordering many businesses to close, leading to a massive drop in sales and activity across Europe.<br/>STORES, RESTAURANTS AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES: The closure list of retailers, national fast food chains or any place where people once congregated continued to grow Tuesday. McDonald's and Wendy's say the dining areas of all North American restaurants are closing. Takeout or delivery is still available at most locations, though some chains have declared out an outright shutdown in areas where clusters of coronavirus have emerged, including Starbucks. McDonald's said in a regulatory filing Tuesday that dining areas in France are closed. In Spain and Italy, both hard hit by COVID-19, all restaurants have locked their doors. The Chicago fast food giant said 95% of its 3,300 restaurants in China are now open.<br/>Ralph Lauren and Foot Locker announced nationwide closures of stores in regulatory filings. They follow Patagonia, Under Armour, Urban Outfitters, REI and others in doing so.<br/>With so many people stocking, and overstocking pantries, Dollar Tree temporarily suspended online ordering to ensure the shelves in its stores are loaded. Like Amazon, Target and Walmart, Dollar Tree has experienced a sharp spike in online orders as consumers scramble to secure staples while avoiding public places. Dollar Tree said most of the items on its website are still available in stores.<br/>With hopes of a rescue fading in a pandemic, the London fashion and furniture retailer Laura Ashley said Tuesday that it will appoint administrators to devise its direction going forward. The company's main shareholder MUI Asia said it will not be able to step in with the money that is needed. The company, which was an iconic presence on the U.K. high street during the 1980s, said in a prepared statement that the outbreak has had \"an immediate and significant impact,\" and that \"ongoing developments indicate that this will be a sustained national situation.\"<br/>U.S. movie theaters have\u00a0closed nationwide, turning dark nearly all of the country's 40,000-plus screens in an unprecedented shutdown. The largest chains had tried to remain open even as Hollywood postponed upcoming releases, including the new James Bond film. But after President Donald Trump on Monday urged against gatherings of more than 10 people, AMC Theaters, the nation's largest chain, said Tuesday its theaters would close.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDMAN-M-713038</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YFR-P531-DYDW-70XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1482\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Manufacturing News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 18, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7383 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Let's show the world that startups from South-east Asia can solve real world problems like poverty and hunger.\"</p><p>Grab's move with Grab Ventures follows its recent monetisation of GrabHitch (formerly a non-commercial carpool service) and its launch of Grab&amp;Go (a service where riders sample and purchase snacks and beauty products during rides) - which hint at the pressure Grab is facing from investors to realise more revenue possibilities and to secure its position as South-east Asia's most valuable startup, observers told The Business Times.</p><p>Li Jianggan, chief of business consultancy firm mworks, said: \"Without Uber in the picture, and before Go-Jek enters Singapore and other South-east Asian markets, I believe Grab is under investor pressure to demonstrate more revenue possibilities.\"</p><p>Last week, Grab said it would implement a 10 per cent platform fee on all GrabHitch rides from June 1 to help fund its operating expenses and invest in product enhancements. It was a move that puzzled the ride-hailing community, given that GrabHitch was launched over two years ago as a non-commercial social carpool service to let drivers keep the full amount paid by riders.</p><p>Mr Li, who was formerly the Asian head of Easy Taxi, said: \"Again, without competition, I think Grab needs to test its revenue limits by charging for services which were previously free.</p><p>\"This will determine how sexy its story is when it eventually files for an initial public offering (IPO). Such tests would be difficult to do in a competitive environment.\"</p><p>Lee Der-Horng, director of the NUS-LTA Transport Research Centre, noted that the platform fee would not significantly affect Grab's driver base. \"Keen GrabHitch drivers will not leave the service simply because of this small sum, as most of them are not treating the service as their source of income, not even revenue.\"</p><p>Grab Ventures will do two things:</p><p> Develop \"cutting-edge technology and build fast-growing businesses\" in-house, such as bike and e-scooter sharing platform GrabCycle; and Run Velocity, Grab's new accelerator programme for growth-stage startups by providing them with expertise, technical resources and networks to help their expansion.Through Velocity, Grab will partner some eight to 10 Series B startups over the next two years, and may invest in those that exhibit \"strong synergies\" with Grab; sectors in focus include transport, food, logistics and financial services.</p><p>BT understands that Grab Ventures manages an open-end fund, and is open to partnering venture capitalist firms to provide capital for its portfolio startups.</p><p>In Singapore, Grab has partnered government agencies such as the info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore and Enterprise SG, to tap their expertise in areas such as capability development, global market access and regulatory support; EDBI, the investment arm of the Singapore Economic Development Board, has also joined as an early partner.</p><p>Grab Ventures' portfolio now includes Drive.ai, a California-based self-driving technology startup; iKaaz, an India-based payment experience startup; Kudo, an Indonesian payments startup which Grab acquired in 2017; and GrabCycle.</p><p>Chris Yeo, head of Grab Ventures, told BT that Grab wants to expand its online-to-offline solutions: \"If there are existing tech companies already doing that, we'd rather partner them than build (the technologies) ourselves.\"</p><p>mworks' Mr Li said: \"Any big tech company will need to make its position more secure.

But he or she would not know how the price or the ride assigned is determined by the frequency of app use, the number of ride-hailing requests at that point, the traffic conditions, or his or her display photo that may encourage a shared ride.</p><p>Dynamic pricing, as well as the evolving business model of both startups and of regulatory stance in this new economy, makes the Grab-Uber merger a test case for the ages here. The crux is in deciding how to monitor and regulate large businesses that are increasingly testing the platform model. The platform model essentially uses the Internet to match supply and demand, and build networks.</p><p>A 2017 Yale Law Journal report titled \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\" argued that US anti-trust laws have yet to contend with how firms with concentrated control over date can \"systematically tilt a market in their favour, dramatically reshaping the sector\".</p><p>The report noted that Amazon's strategy in changing prices of products frequently and personalising prices, comes also as the retailer collects an unprecedented amount of data on consumers' habits. This \"uncharted ground\" puts Amazon on a dramatically different path from other retailers who send personalised discounts from time to time.</p><p>Indeed, the price fluctuations on Amazon's website can be so erratic that widgets have been developed to track the changes in product prices that consumers are eyeing. Some of these price charts are not unlike that for the stock market.</p><p>Amid such price volatility, the lack of transparency adds to the criticism that large platform companies can game the system for profit, at the unwitting expense of consumers. There is also room for discriminatory behaviour that needs to be monitored.</p><p>In the case of ride-hailing, with many promotional codes thrown at consumers to keep ride-hailing prices down, it's hard to say if consumers are paying the true market price of transport demand, despite the deflationary impact of technology.</p><p>But the bigger issue goes beyond another S$3 on each ride - painful as it may be for consumers accustomed to subsidies. The problem is that consumers cannot tell what the fair market price is, when there is just one player making an opaque market. The debate of predatory pricing is a hypothetical exercise in this scenario.</p><p>What raises the complexity is that platform companies are rarely agnostic. Amazon has made its own products that compete against the retailers it hosts on its platform. Similarly, ride-hailing firms host rides from cab companies, while aggregating rides from private-hire cars.</p><p>These details can affect the final price that is doled out to consumers. Without explicit details, you would not know for sure that a private-hire ride was truly the most efficient choice - that is, cheaper, and faster - than say, a cab ride, once promotional codes are stripped out.</p><p>It is also fair to ask if any existing tie-up with any cab company would bring about priority of cab rides offered by this firm over another.</p><p>Grab is meanwhile evolving into a fintech as well with payment and lending capabilities, while enabling credit card payments for rides. So banks and Grab are both collaborators and competitors. How this will affect payment modes and fees is uncertain.</p><p>Such challenges, dubbed a \"platform lock-in\" by a World Economic Forum report, come as the European Commission fined Google more than 2 billion euros (S$3.2 billion) last year for favouring Google's products over that from competitors. Google is appealing the decision.</p><p>Move fast, break things</p><p>The \"move fast and break things\" strategy of Big Tech also requires regulators to apply healthy imagination for how an enlarged entity can dominate a market. In 2012, the UK Office of Fair Trading made a mechanical assessment that Facebook's buy of Instagram was kosher as the functions of the social networks were different.</p><p>\"While Facebook is predominantly used by offline friends using their real identities to connect online and share experiences, Instagram is predominantly used to share artful images by individuals often using pseudonyms.\" It added that Instagram does not provide \"significant marketing opportunities\" as consumers \"do not spend a significant amount of time in the app\". The regulator underestimated the network effect. Today, analysts estimate Instagram could generate US$10 billion in revenue in 2019. Users under age 25 spend more than 30 minutes a day on Instagram.</p><p>Finally, it should be noted that regulations are evolving here in the areas of transport, payments, and data. For example, under the new Payment Services Bill in Singapore, mobile wallets operators that have an average daily e-money float of more than S$5 million a year would have to be licensed. This could include GrabPay.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Monetary Authority of Singapore is also writing guidelines to promote the responsible and ethical use of artificial intelligence and data analytics by financial firms.</p><p>How varying stages of compliance will impact prices charged by large startups emerging from the blooms of puberty is a factor to watch.</p><p>As large startups attract an eye-watering amount of venture capital funds, it is worthwhile observing what the money is chasing. Funds want the next Amazon, or the Big Tech that has forgone margins now for big profits later. In a winner-takes-all environment, funds want to sniff out the one that would take the entire market.</p><p>It is wise then to give the Grab-Uber deal pause. If anything, the \"too big to fail\" lesson is still relevant ten years after the crisis. Tomorrow's moral hazard may come from a flailing giant that moves too fast, and breaks too many things.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-199489</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S31-BFM1-JCF2-831X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 12, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

The GOP's grip on both the White House and Senate since 2016 has permitted the party to boost conservatives in courts \u2014 including two Supreme Court justices.What he's saying: \"[I]f you're a Circuit judge in your mid-60s, late 60s, you can take senior status, now would be a good time to do that if you want to make sure the judiciary is right of center,\" Graham said in Thursday's interview. Asked if current judges can count on their replacements to be confirmed before the 2020 election, Graham noted, \"Well, if you wait, you know, November the 1st, no. So do it now.\" [ 1]: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hughhewitt.com/senator-lindsey-graham-on-george-floyd-supreme-court-snd-circuit-vacancies-witnesses-for-obamagate-hearings-sanctions-on-the-ccp-over-hong-kong-regulating-big-tech-joe-biden-and-more\">https://www.hughhewitt.com/senator-lindsey-graham-on-george-floyd-supreme-court-snd-circuit-vacancies-witnesses-for-obamagate-hearings-sanctions-on-the-ccp-over-hong-kong-regulating-big-tech-joe-biden-and-more</url>/ </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO10009544159069875615375776100132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N3JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"212\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0FBQUFEODc0MTgzNEE5RUE1MTRFQjdCRUM3REE2NTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000984</classCode><className>JUDGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTg1QUIzNkIwNzk5NDQ4NzhGMDdDQjVGNEYyRjY5OTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode><className>Judges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

Lindsey Graham (R-SC) threw subtlety to the winds during a Thursday interview[1] with radio host Hugh Hewitt, encouraging older federal conservative judges to take 'senior status' and make room for a fresh batch. 'This is an historic opportunity,' Graham said. </p><p>'We've put over 200 federal judges on the bench. I think one in five federal judges are Trump appointees. If you can get four more years, I mean, it would change the judiciary for several generations.' 'So if you're a circuit judge in your mid-60s, late 60s, you can take senior status, now would be a good time to do that, if you want to make sure the judiciary is right of center,' he added. 'Senior status' is a state of semi-retirement for a federal judge, when they can choose to take on a reduced caseload if they wish. Their seats on the bench are considered vacant, and the President can appoint replacements. There has been an all-out push from Republican lawmakers and their adjacent powerbrokers to pack the federal courts with conservative justices while the White House and Senate are politically aligned. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has been frank about his efforts, asserting that his remaking of the federal judiciary \u2014and his refusal to let President Barack Obama seat Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court \u2014 is the most important part of his legacy[2]. His efforts have made his initial defenses on the Garland case, that he was letting the 'American people decide,' clearly bogus. If a Supreme Court seat opened in an election year, McConnell said last May,[3] 'we'd fill it.'In his Thursday interview, Graham even acknowledged that 'we changed the rules for the Supreme Court.' GOP lawmakers have been buoyed in their efforts by right-of-center legal groupsincluding[4]the Federalist Society, which channels its money and connections into extensive lobbying and media efforts to fast track hand-selected candidates onto the federal bench. While the efforts to conservative-ize the courts are not new, the GOP willingness to so openly describe the campaign is more recent. That candor, warned Professor Barry Friedman at NYU Law School, could catalyze a backlash sooner rather than later. 'They are loudly and aggressively packing the courts,' he told TPM. 'There is a high probability this is going to end in a crisis for the judiciary down the road.' 'To the extent the judges' opinions are consistent with majority views in the country, the Republicans will have succeeded, but I will not be surprised one iota if the result ultimately is a backlash,' he added. Graham seems unbowed by the possibility. Hewitt asked if he could assure eligible judges that their successors would be confirmed before Election Day \u2014 before, in McConnell's words, the American people have a chance to decide. Graham, in response, urged expediency. 'If you wait no,' he said of the older judges. 'Do it now.'

As we've pointed out, the actual evidence hasn't shown any evidence of bias[1]. The random anecdotal examples of badly moderated content have mostly just shown how difficult it is[2] to do content moderation at scale. The \"bad\" moderation decisions impact lots of folks across the political spectrum -- it's just that some grandstanding Republicans like to engage in confirmation bias (the only actual bias that seems to be occurring here) to suggest the moderation mistakes are politically motivated. We've pointed out multiple times now that crying wolf[3] on this issue is not a good look for conservatives -- on multiple levels. </p><p>Beyond the fact that the evidence seems to disprove the claims of bias (oh, and yet another study has shown no evidence of bias[4]), for years these very same Republicans kept attacking the idea of the \"fairness doctrine,\" which was an FCC rule in place for a few decades, demanding \"equal representation\" of political views on the public airwaves. It hasn't been in place for a while, but for a few years, this same group of Republicans grandstanded about false claims that Democrats were trying to bring it back. And yet, what they seem to be demanding now is the return of the fairness doctrine, but in an even more ridiculous way. Rather than on the public airwaves -- where at the very least there was some legitimate claim to the government being able to set some conditions -- these Senators now seem to want to force private companies to run businesses the way they want them to. What a bunch of hypocrites. And the largest of the hypocrites is Senator Ted Cruz, who has continued to repeat this myth, holding multiple hearings on the topic, including a new one yesterday[5], with representatives from Facebook and Twitter in attendance. Someone from Google was supposed to be there but (get this), Ted Cruz rejected the Google witness[6], likely after discovering that Google was sending a former Ted Cruz staffer, who would have done a nice job debunking his former boss's nonsense. Kinda ironic, in a hearing on platforms supposedly blocking conservatives from speaking, the Senate itself decided to block a conservative from speaking. Most of the hearing went pretty much as planned, with the usual nonsense. Cruz, once again, misrepresented the nature of Section 230 of the CDA and also made noises about changing it. He also threatened other attacks on social media companies, including antitrust. The big \"gotcha\" moment that some in the press have picked up on was particularly dumb. Cruz rolled out an anti-abortion quote from Mother Theresa that had been used in an ad on Twitter that was apparently blocked, and demanded that Twitter and Facebook execs answer \"is this hate speech?\"[7]. That, of course, misses the point massively. As Twitter's representative on the panel, Carlos Monje Jr. noted, the tweet was caught in an automated system review, but that the advertiser behind it remains as an advertiser in good standing on the platform -- and he also noted that advertisements on both sides of the abortion debate had been blocked at times on Twitter, which makes total sense, given the strong emotions and controversy felt around that issue. But the bigger point is trotting out a single example is nonsense. It's grandstanding. As we've discussed time and time again, content moderation is an arena of massive gray space, rather than black and white. There are tons of judgment calls, and much of it depends on what it is the platform is actually trying to accomplish. Some platforms don't want controversial content. Some platforms don't want \"hate\" speech. But what falls into those categories is an open question and in a free market system (the kind Republicans used to claim they supported), we let the companies decide for themselves. Thankfully, a bunch of conservative/Republican groups and commentators spoke out against Cruz's nonsense as well. The group Americans for Prosperity put out a statement calling out Cruz's nonsense[8]:... asking the government to police online speech - either through direct action or by cajoling private firms - sets a dangerous precedent that will undermine essential elements of free speech. Government regulation of digital speech won't protect free speech. It will only increase the likelihood of government censorship. 'Tech companies have the freedom to run their businesses as they see fit, including setting standards for what user content they do and do not want to host, and Americans have the right to speak through alternative platforms or share their opinions elsewhere. 'Today's largest tech platforms may have the means to manage the legal risk of administering an online speech code but smaller startups do not, so regulation intended to curtail the influence of large tech companies would only cement it.'TechFreedom's Berin Szoka didn't mince words[9] either:'Mind-bogglingly, it's conservatives who are now leading the charge to resurrect the Fairness Doctrine,' continued Sz\u00f3ka. 'Conservatives spent nearly 80 years crusading against government meddling in media. Yet now, they're trying to subject website operators to essentially the same, hopelessly arbitrary standard of 'neutrality' they long opposed. They've twisted themselves into ideological pretzels by convincing themselves that Section 230 is some kind of special subsidy to 'Big Tech' and that the law has always required neutrality. Both claims are patently false. All websites that host user content need clear legal protections against broad liability for user content. Without such protections, the fear of being sued will shut down the smallest sites \u2014 and, ironically, protect Big Tech from competition. But even the biggest sites will do less of the kind of content moderation that makes online communities and services usable. In the end, how they run their services will become subject to political pressure. Sadly, it already is, which seems to be the purpose of conservative fear-mongering on this issue.' 'The anecdotal examples of anti-conservative bias in content moderation just don't hold up,' concluded Sz\u00f3ka. 'Cruz, Graham and other leading Republicans have repeatedly cited bogus examples of conservatives being 'censored.' Most exemplary is the brazenly false claim that now Sen. Marsha Blackburn was censored for her pro-life views. In fact, her Senate campaign launch video centered on the defamatory claim that Planned Parenthood was selling baby body parts. Neither this video nor her account were taken down by the major platforms; instead, they simply declined to allow her to pay to promote the video because it violated their terms of service. This isn't censorship; it's just ad companies preventing the abuse of their advertising systems. Sadly, the companies involved haven't had the courage to debunk these claims clearly because of the vast political pressure wielded against them by lawmakers bent on partisan revenge. Their timidity should remind us all that the First Amendment bars bullying media companies just as much as explicit censorship.'Indeed, during the hearing, Marsha Blackburn brought up the bogus ad controversy, saying: 'Should Twitter allow ads that denounce Planned Parenthood for selling baby body parts?' That's a ridiculous question for a sitting Senator to ask. No one in Congress should be determining what ads are allowed or not allowed on any platform. And, again, Twitter did allow Blackburn's video. It just said such an ad violated its policies (which it did, because it was nonsense). Others have raised this point in the past as well. The Cato Institute last year questioned why Ted Cruz -- a supposed conservative free marketer -- seems so against property rights[10] when it comes to the property rights of internet companies. It's almost as if he's a total hypocrite who believes in government intervention against companies he dislikes, but insists on no government intervention when it's companies he does like. Remember, this is the same Ted Cruz who falsely attacked \"net neutrality\" as a government takeover of the internet[11]. And now he's whining that the government needs to force neutrality on the internet. How can anyone possibly take him seriously?Permalink[12] | Comments[13] | Email This Story[14] [ 1]: <url

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank\u2019s monetary policy framework review.   The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.   To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target. -Fed Chair Powell to speak on Fed\u2019s framework review next Thursday -Coronavirus legacy will be weak global inflation: economists  2/NATIONAL SERVICE  Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector\u2019s downward trend in the first quarter.   The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.   The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.   Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year\u2019s while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show. -China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013 -China\u2019s banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013  3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?  The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar\u2019s decline as the world\u2019s reserve currency.   Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.   And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar\u2019s 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold\u2019s eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.   Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs. -King dollar\u2019s decline ripples across the globe. -U.S. dollar headed lower, in retreat against the euro  4/VALUE SIRENS  Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.   Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.   A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won\u2019t touch them with a barge pole.   Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap. -LIVE MARKETS-Value sirens singing the blues -Capital exited stock markets as S&amp;P hit new record - BofA  5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE  Belarus\u2019s political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country\u2019s main economic ally.   Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s \u2018landslide\u2019 election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it\u2019s not obvious how the tensions get resolved.   For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia\u2019s currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.   Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny\u2019s allies alleging poisoning.   -Pompeo says U.S. supports international probe of Belarus election -Belarusian protesters defy Lukashenko, EU announces sanctions -ANALYSIS-Putin bets on

Now a key challenge is how to spur inflation. Fed Chair Jerome Powell may give hints on Thursday on the opening day of the Jackson Hole conference, where he will discuss the central bank\u2019s monetary policy framework review.   The review looks at how to revamp Fed tools to guide the economy. As part of that, investors have been anticipating details on possible changes to how it targets inflation.   To guard against the possibility of higher prices ahead, investors have loaded up on assets like gold and TIPs. Still, while five-year five-year forwards - an inflation gauge - have been rising, the measure remains below the Fed\u2019s 2% target.   Graphic: Five-year five-year inflati here   2/NATIONAL SERVICE  Chinese banks are expected to show the scars of the pandemic and the domestic economic slowdown for the first time when they report half-yearly earnings, having bucked the Western banking sector\u2019s downward trend in the first quarter.   The big five state banks, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of China (BoC), kick off earnings season on Aug. 28.   The government has pressed banks into service: financial institutions have been told to sacrifice 1.5 trillion yuan ($217 billion) in profit this year to support companies by lowering lending rates and fees, and deferring loan payments.   Beijing wants new loans and overall financing to top last year\u2019s while the banking regulator has asked lenders to raise loan-loss provisions and come up with realistic profit plans. That means profits won\u2019t be growing, as the filings will show.-China keeps lending benchmark LPR steady for 4th straight month, in line with market \u2013-China\u2019s banking sector expected to dispose $490 bln of bad loans in 2020 \u2013 Xinhua \u2013   Graphic: China Big 5 banks' earnings here   3/ QUO VADIS, GREENBACK?  The dollar, slipping to more than two year lows in recent days, looks out of favour thanks to negative inflation-adjusted yields, weaker macro-economic data and tensions between Washington and Beijing. The downward move has fueled familiar talk about the dollar\u2019s decline as the world\u2019s reserve currency.   Investors are trying to gauge where next for the greenback. Intraday volatility has increased across the currency complex suggesting bearish positioning versus the dollar may be at extremes.   And unlike July, when virtually all non-dollar currencies and precious metals gained on the dollar\u2019s 4% fall, August has been a mixed bag. The yen and the Aussie have struggled. Even gold\u2019s eye-watering rally is showing signs of exhaustion after hitting a record near $2,100 per ounce earlier this month.   Throw in a U.S. Federal Reserve wary of pumping in more stimulus just yet, approaching U.S. elections and the greenback may find some fresh legs.   Graphic: USD positions and CFTC here   4/VALUE SIRENS  Betting on a recovery of so-called value (read cheap) stocks has become a popular mainstream call among sell-side analysts as investors scramble to assess which bits of the market the rally could lift next.   Value stocks generally lag in the first stages of a bounce-back but usually follow risk-on stocks upwards as the economic recovery unfolds. Now with hopes that a COVID-19 vaccine could be widely available in early 2021, overlooked undervalued stocks are becoming tempting targets for stock pickers.   A rotation to value, targeting banks, autos and energy value stocks has already made tentative runs, but the decade long underperformance of that segment of the market means many won\u2019t touch them with a barge pole.   Looking at the outstanding performance of value stocks and  big tech since the great financial crisis in general - and the COVID-19 market in particular - investors are wary of the value-trap.   Graphic: Rotati here   5/(BELA)RUSSIAN ROULETTE  Belarus\u2019s political crisis rumble on, dragging the European Union and the United States into another proxy standoff with Russia, the country\u2019s main economic ally.   Street protests over alleged vote rigging in President Alexander Lukashenko\u2019s \u2018landslide\u2019 election win are set to continue in Minsk. With Lukashenko refusing to re-run the vote and starting a criminal case against the opposition, it\u2019s not obvious how the tensions get resolved.   For Moscow, Belarus is an important strategic buffer against NATO and the EU and Russia sells the country oil at below-market prices. But the relationship is testy and even Russia\u2019s currency and bonds might now be affected by the situation, especially if sanctions come into play.   Meanwhile the hospitalisation of Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny, the biggest thorn in the Kremlin\u2019s side, will do little to shift unwanted attention away from Moscow, with Navalny\u2019s allies alleging poisoning.

You should be the one in control,\" says the distinguished expert-in-residence at Ryerson University, who leads the Privacy by Design Centre of Excellence</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Practically it's about tech giants collecting and selling our data to third parties without our consent, she adds. This has been exposed in a slate of recent scandals, from the discovery of a microphone built into Google's Nest Secure home security system, to tracking by Google services on Android devices and iPhones even when privacy settings are turned on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She singles out Facebook and Google as particularly being a concern.</p><p>\"They have created a state of surveillance,\" she says.</p><p>Amazon is not as bad but there are still concerns, she adds, like with their controversial facial recognition technology, Amazon Rekognition. The company's own shareholders urged Amazon not to sell it to governments, fearing potential human rights abuses.</p><p>Microsoft and Apple deserve more credit, she says, and their CEOs have both made public commitments to privacy. That's because companies like Apple are selling a physical product, unlike Facebook and Google, says Avner Levin, a professor at the Ted Rogers School of Management in the law and business department.</p><p>\"The people that are using the service are the product that is actually being sold to advertisers,\" he says, referring to Facebook and Google. \"We are the product that they are selling.\"</p><p>Privacy is linked to wider issues like fake news, and the weakening of democratic institutions, he adds. This was illustrated in the 2016 U.S. election campaign, when Russians deployed targeted information to manipulate social media users.</p><p>What others are doing: In the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission is currently investigating to see if Facebook violated a 2011 \"consent decree,\" which said they would address concerns about the tracking and sharing of user data, Cavoukian says. Facebook could face a hefty fine if found to be in breach of this order.</p><p>But the \"gold standard\" for privacy legislation is the European Union, says Levin. It passed the comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation in 2016. The legislation includes hefty fines (up to 4 per cent of a company's global revenue or 20 million euros, whichever is greater). It also has strict language on consent, the concept of privacy by design, and the right to be forgotten, under which individuals can apply to have negative search results deleted.</p><p>Similar laws have been passed in Japan, Brazil and California, Cavoukian says, and there's discussion in the U.S. about national legislation.</p><p>What Canada is doing: Canada is in \"a significantly weaker situation than the EU,\" says Andrew Clement, professor emeritus in the faculty of information at the University of Toronto.</p><p>The federal Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) was developed in 2000, before Facebook and smartphones, and lacks the \"fining powers\" of the EU law.</p><p>\"There appears to be more willingness in the EU to use existing powers for bringing the tech giants to account,\" he says.</p><p>Levin says there's been an \"absolute lack of will\" on the part of both the Trudeau and Harper governments to do anything about privacy.</p><p>In 2012 in response to complaints, the federal privacy commissioner did an investigation into Facebook. But the office doesn't have the \"power to force Facebook to do anything,\" he says.</p><p>The EU, influenced heavily by the Germans, is more attuned to the dangers of a loss of privacy, given their history of totalitarian governments.</p><p>\"They're a lot more willing to regulate the companies, they're a lot more worried about the consequences,\" he says.</p><p>But Cavoukian is optimistic that Canada can catch up.</p><p>In 2018, the federal standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics issued a report entitled \"Towards Privacy by Design,\" which she believes shows a \"clear intent\" to enhance the law.</p><p>May Warren</p><p>The issue: This is a newer area, and there's no scientifically established condition of social media or smartphone addiction.</p><p>There are however \"problematic behaviours\" associated with the technologies that are similar to the ones found in recognized addictions to drugs, alcohol or gambling, such as not being able to cut back on use, says Centre for Addiction and Mental Health senior scientist Dr. Robert Mann.</p><p>Mann says a 2016 CAMH survey of adults found 40 per cent said yes to at least one of a number of questions such as whether screen habits had ever caused the respondent to miss school, work or important social activities, or whether a family member had ever expressed concern.</p><p>Eight per cent of respondents said yes to three or more of the questions.</p><p>Matthew Johnson, director of education at digital literacy non-profit MediaSmarts, wouldn't call it an addiction either. But he has heard of serious problematic behaviours, especially among young people using apps or social media sites that seem designed to keep them coming back.</p><p>Snapchat streaks, where kids keep sending Snapchats to their friends every day to keep their streak and earn a flame icon, even if it means missing sleep, are one example.</p><p>Benjamin Wong, a registered clinical counsellor in behavioural addictions in B.C., says he's seen about a 5 per cent increase over the last five years in people with screen or tech issues. He believes \"hooking\" customers with colourful, engaging social media sites or apps is a \"cornerstone\" of the tech business.</p><p>What others are doing: Other jurisdictions haven't gone as far as they have on issues such as data collection, or fake news.</p><p>France recently passed a law that companies with more than 50 employees can't email employees after business hours, giving individuals \"the right to disconnect.\"</p><p>The goal, said officials in that country at the time, was to prevent burnout and reduce work-related stress. But Mann says such an idea might also help with addictive behaviour.</p><p>\"I think it's interesting to consider that that kind of a law might reduce the need or the urge to continually access your devices,\" he says.</p><p>In the U.K., the digital, culture, media and sport parliamentary committee launched an inquiry into the growth of \"immersive and addictive technologies\" in December 2018, looking into the \"addictive nature of some technologies,\" and how they can impact behaviour.</p><p>What Canada is doing: \"Not a whole lot has been done\" in this country, says Wong, adding even much of the advocacy about regulating tech giants has been around privacy and data.</p><p>Mann says it's a rich area for researchers, who might start by developing guidelines for healthy use.</p><p>May Warren</p><p>The issue: In the mid-1980s, when Canada's GST was still a twinkle in then prime minister Brian Mulroney's eye, the World Wide Web had not yet been invented and Google's founders were still pre-teen boys. Since then, digital technologies have advanced at breakneck speeds and companies like Google - not to mention Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon - have become essential to how Canadians spend their time and money.</p><p>They have also been reaping billions in profits. Tax codes, meanwhile, have evolved more slowly and governments are now grappling with how to bring their taxation systems into the digital age.</p><p>\"There is a missed opportunity for taxing these companies,\" says Rosalie Wyonch, a policy analyst with the C.D. Howe Institute. \"Digital technology has been outpacing our ability to regulate (and) tax.\"</p><p>Traditionally, tax systems were dependent on the idea of \"permanent establishment,\" Wyonch explains - this assumes a company has a physical presence within a country, or relates to physical goods crossing borders. But \"our tax code hasn't been updated to deal with intangibles,\" she says.</p><p>Yet as digital services become more popular, the potential losses in sales tax revenue grow bigger, says University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist, the Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law. (In 2017, Wyonch wrote that if Netflix alone were to collect and remit GST/HST, this would inject $50 million per year into Canada's tax coffers).</p><p>Meanwhile, domestic companies - which do have to collect and remit sales taxes - argue they are left at a competitive disadvantage, Geist adds.</p><p>When it comes to taxing corporate income, global discussions are now underway to figure out how this should be handled when it comes to big tech. \"That is a very complex international system that we're waiting for consensus on,\" according to Wyonch.</p><p>There are major challenges when it comes to simply defining the income of digital companies, she says. Say a foreign company does a digital marketing campaign for a Canadian company. \"Did they earn that income where they're located, or did they earn that income in Canada, if they never entered Canada (or) hosted any of its content on Canadian servers?\" Wyonch asks. \"We don't have a clear way to define, in a black and white way, what would - and would not - be considered Canadian income.\"</p><p>What others are doing: The G20 and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have set a 2020 deadline for fighting tax avoidance (which tech giants are frequently accused of) and developing international standards for taxing big tech. But several countries - like the U.K., France, Spain, Australia and New Zealand - are already considering interim measures, raising concerns of creating a hodgepodge of different approaches around the world. The European Union has also unveiled plans for a digital tax of 3 per cent of revenues, an idea that has received blowback, including from some member states.</p><p>What Canada is doing: Finance Minister Bill Morneau told reporters last October that Ottawa is studying whether a new regulatory landscape is needed for the digital economy and he is pushing the G20 to speed up its timeline for establishing new rules. But Morneau says Canada's goal is to wait for an international consensus before taking action.</p><p>Quebec and Saskatchewan, however, have forged ahead on the sales tax issue and this year, both started applying provincial sales taxes to foreign digital companies. In Quebec, more than 80 international companies - including Amazon, Apple, Google and Netflix - were registered as of Feb. 18 to collect and remit provincial sales tax in that province.</p><p>Jennifer Yang</p><p>The issue: In recent years, the world has rudely awakened to the proliferation of hate speech and \"fake news\" on social media - especially during election cycles, when online content can be used to disrupt democratic processes.</p><p>Regulators and social media companies have come under pressure to stem the flow of online hate speech and malicious \"disinformation.\" But these are complicated problems with no easy fixes; the sheer volume of harmful content online is overwhelming and the notion of regulating speech will always provoke free speech concerns while drawing fierce opposition.</p><p>And while some countries have legal definitions for hate speech, defining \"fake news\" is a tricky proposition; it can also be a dangerous one, especially in the hands of authoritarian regimes that want to censor information or crack down on the free press.</p><p>Regulators have struggled to find workable solutions. \"No one's figured it out,\" says Heidi Tworek, an assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia who studies media, democracy and the digital economy. \"We continue to have to really evaluate many of these different schemes that are being proposed. These are such large and complex questions.\"</p><p>What others are doing: Several European countries are now moving toward regulating social media platforms, deploying strategies that have drawn both criticism and praise. In France, the government passed a law in November that empowers judges to order the removal of \"fake news\" during elections; violators face a penalty of one year in prison or a fine of 75,000 euros.</p><p>In the United Kingdom, a new parliamentary report - released last week following an 18-month investigation - is also calling for platforms like Facebook to be brought under regulatory control. The report proposes several new regulations, including a mandatory code of ethics and independent regulator who can bring legal proceedings against social media companies.</p><p>Germany has taken a particularly bold approach to regulating hate speech on social media. In January 2018, the country passed its Net Enforcement Act - sometimes dubbed the NetzDG or \"Facebook law\" - which forces tech companies to remove hate speech within 24 hours of illegal content being reported. (When it's unclear whether content is actually illegal under German law, tech companies have seven days to consult and decide.)</p><p>The penalty for breaking this law? Up to 50 million euros in fines. \"This is probably the furthest anyone has gone in trying to get large social media companies to adopt their policies to local laws,\" Tworek says.</p><p>What Canada is doing: \"Canadians, and the Canadian government, are alive and alert to the issues,\" says Dwayne Winseck, a journalism professor at Carleton University and director of the Canadian Media Concentration Research Project.</p><p>He points to Canada's recently-passed electoral reform bill, C-76, as a positive step. Online platforms like Facebook and Google must now create a registry of digital advertisements placed by political or third parties during elections and ensure they remain visible for two years. The law also bans the use of foreign money by \"third party\" advocacy groups during campaign periods - meaning social media companies can't knowingly accept advertisements paid for with foreign funds.</p><p>Another provision prohibits making false statements about a candidate to influence an election. This only applies narrowly to certain types of statements, however (for example, statements about whether a candidate has broken the law or their place of birth).</p><p>In January, the federal government unveiled plans for safeguarding the upcoming election, including a $7 million initiative to improve the public's ability to detect \"online deceptive practices\" and a team of five bureaucrats who will alert the public whenever they find evidence of election interference.</p><p>But where Canada could be innovating more is with social media regulation more generally, says journalist Chris Tenove, a PhD candidate at the University of British Columbia who studies global governance and digital politics.</p><p>He would like to see Canada follow the lead of jurisdictions like the European Union, which worked together with social media companies to develop a code of conduct. As a result, platforms have voluntarily committed to \"quickly and efficiently\" addressing hate speech and early reports have shown good results, he says.</p><p>One promising spot is Canada's involvement with an international effort called the Grand Committee on Disinformation and Fake News. Comprising parliamentarians from nine countries, the committee is scheduled to meet in Ottawa this May and has called for social media executives - including Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai - to appear so they can explain what they're doing to stop the spread of disinformation.</p><p>Jennifer Yang</p><p>The issue: Copyright protections are evolving in the digital age as countries ramp up efforts to combat piracy and online infringement. The need for new measures has come to the forefront amid a torrent of illegal downloads of online content from providers including Netflix and YouTube and the pirating of material for commercial and personal use.</p><p>What others are doing: Protections are being updated in jurisdictions including the U.S. and especially the European Union, which is set to vote this spring in the European Parliament on an overhaul that would block copyright-protected material, including software, films, music and books, from being uploaded or electronically shared without permission from creators.</p><p>A provision of the proposed policy would effectively mandate that companies including Facebook and Google develop and fund technology to automatically filter out infringed content on their sites and search engines on a mass scale.</p><p>In the U.S., meanwhile, momentum is building around proposals in Congress that could formalize and increase royalty payments for music creators whose work is played on digital services.</p><p>In many developing jurisdictions, the push to reform intellectual property protections has become part of a plan to boost economic competitiveness, with China, for example, proposing to make websites liable for promoting unlicensed works as part of a broader reform of property rights.</p><p>Australia, which was described by the country's attorney general in 2014 as the \"worst offender\" for pirated content, has proposed laws that would make it far easier for copyright owners to achieve court orders that would force search engines and internet service providers to block or delete pirated content.</p><p>What Canada is doing: Here, part of the response is contained in the Copyright Modernization Act, which requires that providers give notice to customers suspected of pirating content. It is left to the injured party to sue, with awards capped at $5,000 for non-commercial infringement.</p><p>Provisions in Canada's legislation also prohibit demands for payment in the infringement notices, as well as links to any other sites where payments can be made to content creators.</p><p>The notice provision has been criticized by groups including the International Intellectual Property Alliance of content creators who say it \"fails to provide meaningful incentives for network service providers to co-operate with copyright owners to deal with copyright infringements that take place in the digital network environment.\"</p><p>Another possible impediment to the notice provision stems from the new trade agreement among Canada, the U.S. and Mexico that limits internet platforms' liability for users' content, while the deal also stipulates that Canada eventually extend its copyright term. The liability provision could prevent Canada from adopting European-style digital copyright rules, experts note.</p><p>Michael Lewis</p><p>The issue: The rise of a short list of dominant tech companies has put reform of traditional notions of competition law at the top of the agenda for policy-makers around the globe.</p><p>Modern competition law holds that when companies control large market shares, the result is higher prices and lower quality. It does not, however, make a monopoly illegal, prohibiting only the abuse of the power that a monopoly makes possible through exclusionary practices.</p><p>Experts say practices such as a company giving its own products top ranking in its online search engine have been given a boost by so-called big data - the corporate accumulation of massive data sets that are automatically processed through computer algorithms and artificial intelligence. Big data could pose competitive threats by allowing exclusive licensing deals for critical data sets, for example, says Ariane Le Strat, a U.K.-based associate with international law firm Bird Bird, or companies could agree to price-discriminate - charge more to certain people based on their perceived ability to pay - as a result of customer data they have obtained.</p><p>The public outcry over the misuse of personal data after the Cambridge Analytica scandal early last year, when it was revealed that Facebook had harvested personal information for political purposes without consent, ratcheted up the pressure on regulators, Le Strat says, with the U.S. among others vowing vigorous antitrust enforcement in the area.</p><p>What others are doing: The European Union has taken the lead in enforcing stricter laws aimed at tech companies suspected of wilfully abusing their market dominance.</p><p>Its competition directorate, for example, has imposed heavy sanctions in cases where it has alleged market abuse by technology giants, including the 2.4-billion-euro fine levied against Google in 2017 for privileging its own products in search results. The European Union has also taken dramatic steps against Microsoft, now requiring its ubiquitous Windows operating system to enable a variety of web browsers.</p><p>Germany's competition watchdog has ordered Facebook to curb its data collection excesses and is investigating Amazon after complaints from third-party sellers that their business was being hurt by the company's dual role as both a retailer on its Amazon Marketplace and the platform's owner/operator. The European Commission's competition watchdog is probing whether Amazon gains unfair advantage from the data it collects via transactions on the an e-commerce platform.</p><p>Against this backdrop, some consumer advocacy groups have called for a breakup of the big U.S. tech companies similar to the tearing asunder of the U.S. Bell system in the 1980s - or at the very least an overhaul of competition statutes to address the new threats from the tech giants' market dominance.</p><p>What Canada is doing: Canada has maintained that while the emergence of firms that control and exploit data can raise new challenges for competition law enforcement, \"this is not in and of itself cause for concern,\" according to the Competition Bureau.</p><p>In a February 2018 report, the bureau concluded that while \"big data may require specific methods and tools, the bureau's traditional enforcement framework will continue to apply.\"</p><p>The report says data tools that analyze and adjust to changes in the conduct of consumers and competitors may \"soften competition\" but this is really just an extension of practices that companies used before information technology was developed.</p><p>Moreover, it says conscious parallelism (where firms in an oligopoly are aware that their pricing and output decisions have a significant impact upon rivals and without an explicit agreement co-ordinate their behaviour as if they were engaged in collusive behaviour) is not by itself prohibited under Canadian competition law.</p><p>\"For competition law enforcement in Canada,\" according to Sandy Walker, a competition law partner at Dentons in Toronto, \"it's d#233;j#224; vu for now.\"</p><p>Michael Lewis</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019022453576686</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VH0-8KT1-JBTY-W0K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 24, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

So too, apparently, does Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A 6000-word report published in the New York Times recently disclosed in humiliating detail the lengths to which Facebook has gone to protect its dominance and attack its critics.</p><p>As various interlocking crises concerning hate speech, misinformation, and data privacy widened, top executives ignored, and then kept secret, evidence that the platform had become a vector for misinformation campaigns by government-backed Russian trolls. The company mounted a shockingly aggressive lobbying and public-relations campaign, which included creating and circulating pro-Facebook blog posts that were functionally indistinguishable from the \"co-ordinated inauthentic content\" (that is, fake news) Facebook had pledged to eliminate from its platform.</p><p>In one particularly galling example, the company hired a political consultancy that spread a conspiracy theory accusing George Soros of funding anti-Facebook protests.</p><p>Zuckerberg, it seems, had taken the \"really harsh approach\" to establishing digital hegemony.</p><p>Augustus, at least, was a charismatic leader and confident ruler. No one at Facebook comes across in the Times piece as a similarly bold visionary.</p><p>Not Joel Kaplan, Facebook's top lobbyist, who encouraged the company to suppress and hold back findings of Russian influence campaigns for fear of alienating Republicans. Not Chuck Schumer, who confronted one of the Senate's top Facebook critics and told him to figure out how to work with the company. (Schumer's daughter works for Facebook.) Not Sheryl Sandberg, the adult-in-the-room chief operating officer who presided over the entire suspicious and hostile crisis response. And certainly not Zuckerberg, who seems to have been consistently absent - or plainly uninterested - during key meetings about Facebook's handling of hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>It's hard to be a historical visionary hailed for brokering stability by making morally complex decisions if you can't even be bothered to show up to the Morally Complex Decisions meetings.</p><p>Demands for the CEO to abdicate, or to at least step down from his role as chairman of the board, have increased, but Zuckerberg - who controls 60 per cent of Facebook's voting shares - is no more likely to resign than Augustus would have been.</p><p>As the Wall Street Journal reports, he told company executives earlier this year that Facebook is at war.</p><p>The trouble is that the war may have already been lost. Beset by stagnant growth, low employee morale, plummeting stock, public outrage, and a bipartisan group of enemies in government, the old Facebook, the ever-expanding, government-ignoring, world-conquering company of only a year or two ago, is gone.</p><p>Its own internal surveys bear this out: Facebook was once legendary for the cultish dedication of its employees - reporting on the company was nearly impossible because workers refused to leak - but employee confidence in Facebook's future, as judged by internal surveys reported on by the Journal, is down 32 percentage points over the past year, to 52 per cent.</p><p>Around the same number of Facebook employees think the company is making the world a better place, down 19 points from this time last year, and employees report that they plan to leave Facebook for new jobs earlier than they had in the past.</p><p>Scarier even for Facebook is the possibility, for which there is some anecdotal evidence, that it's no longer a sought-after employer for top computer-science and engineering graduates.</p><p>There's already ample evidence that Facebook is losing its hold on users. In the markets where Facebook is most profitable, its user base is either stagnant, as in North America, or actually shrinking, as in Europe. The company might be able to reassure itself that Instagram - which it wholly owns - is still expanding impressively, but the success of Instagram hasn't stopped Facebook from getting punished on the stock market.</p><p>Facebook blames its attenuating European-user figures not on its faltering public image but on the European Union's aggressive new privacy law, GDPR. But this raises a more troubling possibility for Facebook: that its continued success is dependent on a soft regulatory touch it can no longer expect from governments.</p><p>What makes the Times revelations particularly dangerous to Zuckerberg's empire is that they arrive at a moment when there is actually the political will to challenge its dominance.</p><p>The fall of Facebook may not come after a long decline but through outside action - slapped with major fines and expensive investigations, chastened and disempowered by a new regulatory regime.</p><p>\"Facebook cannot be trusted to regulate itself,\" Rhode Island representative David Cicilline - who will likely run the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust issues - tweeted recently.</p><p>In the Senate, the scepticism regarding tech giants is enough of a bipartisan issue that there appears to be room for an agreement on data protection and user privacy.</p><p>\"I'm not looking to regulate (Zuckerberg) half to death,\" Republican senator John Kennedy said earlier this year, \"but I can tell you this: The issue isn't going away.\"</p><p>It's true that some Republican critics seem less concerned about Facebook's overwhelming power than about the spurious claims of conservatives that their views are being suppressed on the platform, but there is genuine Republican interest in reining in Facebook.</p><p>Action against big tech companies is a beloved topic of Steve Bannon and his wing of the GOP, and US President Donald Trump himself, of course, has no particular affection for the company. Trump's Department of Justice, in fact, might represent Facebook's biggest threat.</p><p>The head of the Antitrust Division, Makan Delrahim, has been singing the praises of the famous DOJ Microsoft antitrust lawsuit.</p><p>As Tim Wu, a former FTC adviser and the author of The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the Gilded Age, puts it, \"whoever leads the case to break up Facebook will have the political winds and the public at his back\". A new Axios poll supports this assessment.</p><p>Americans have reversed their opinions about social media over the past year, and a majority of Americans across the political spectrum now believe that social media hurts democracy and that the Government isn't doing enough to regulate it.</p><p>It's the public outrage that should be most worrying to Facebook. Other tech giants have managed to escape the condemnation directed at Facebook because they have obviously useful services.</p><p>Amazon delivers things to your house. Google helps you find things online. Apple sells actual objects. Facebook \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 helps you get into fights? Delivers your old classmates' political opinions to your brain?</p><p>Over the past year, I've spent time trying to wean myself off tech mega-platforms, generally with little success.</p><p>Google's search, for all my complaints, is still the best way for me to navigate the internet; Amazon is still so unbelievably convenient that the thought of quitting it exhausts me.</p><p>But I logged out of Facebook more than a year ago and have logged back in fewer than a dozen times since. Checking Facebook had been a daily habit, but it also hadn't improved my life or made itself necessary.</p><p>Not many Roman plebs would have said that about the Pax Romana. Some empires fall because they're invaded from the outside or rot from within. Zuckerberg's could be the first in history to collapse simply because its citizens logged out.</p><p>\u00c2\u00a92018 New York Media LLC.

A new coalition and a report unveiled Tuesday make clear that era is over.</p><p>The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grass-roots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is beginning to form.</p><p>The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p>While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p>\"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p>\"It has incredible impact,\" Perriello said of Amazon. \"Who could possibly shape its future and direction?\"</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the past year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p>In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p>Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grass-roots efforts to rein in Amazon's power.</p><p>Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the City Council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p>These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p>\"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p>Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p>In a separate move on Monday, Fight for the Future and other groups called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p>The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p>\"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have - the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behavior - and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p>Athena's $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about. \"This is grass-roots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p>The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p>\"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name - People Against Amazon or whatever - because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. \"To be for something, not just against.\"</p><p>Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but was more interested in trying to sway it - including its employees and customers.</p><p>\"Half the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,\" Kaoosji said. \"That gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-670190</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKT-XV31-JBM5-P3S2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"927\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001948</classCode><className>LABOR &amp;

However, she is unmarried with no children or debt, and expects her income will still cover all of her expenses and produce modest savings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I have dual US/British citizenship and am entitled to state pensions from both countries,\" says Sadie. \"However, I do not expect either of these to generate much in 30 years' time, and because the income from my new low-paid job is uncertain I am leaving it out of my calculations. I also have two US and three UK pensions. I have some control over the fund selection within the UK pensions, which I started managing at age 26.</p><p>\"I also started running an investment portfolio five years ago, which I would like to be the principal source of a comfortable retirement income from age 65. So far it has delivered an annual return of 13 per cent and my pensions have delivered an average annual return of about 9 per cent. But, based on historical performance and the current low-growth climate, I have set my annual return target at 7 per cent. This should build up a fund large enough to provide an annual income of around \u00a355,000 by the time I retire at 65, assuming 4 per cent interest on the capital and no further contributions.</p><p>\"I am moderately risk-tolerant so I have kept to low-cost, comparatively safer active funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs). However, I may incur unforeseen costs between now and when I retire, for example when buying a house, which I might do in the next three years, or raising a future family. So I need growth to be able to meet my target, and I'm prepared to take on significantly more risk to achieve this. I could stomach a loss of up to 30 per cent in any given year.</p><p>\"I have a long-term investment horizon. I typically hold between 10 and 15 investments for a minimum of one year, and aim to keep the core holdings on a semi-permanent basis.</p><p>\"The portfolio is designed to be low-maintenance. I have diversified it across markets with a bias to the US. Last year I started a portfolio of US-listed stocks, mainly dividend aristocrats [S&amp;P 500 companies that have grown their dividends every year for 25 years or more] and growth companies.</p><p>\"I pick sectors and markets that seem like they might consistently deliver double-digit growth. I reinvest dividends, keep transaction and management costs low, and hold my investments in tax-efficient wrappers where possible. I check my portfolio every week and adjust the allocation twice a year.</p><p>\"I have avoided bonds because I think they are overvalued and UK interest rates may rise. So instead I have tried to diversify the portfolio with commodity and real estate ETFs.\"</p><p>THE BIG PICTURE Chris Dillow, Investors Chronicle's economist, says: I fear that your target returns are too high. In the long run it's unlikely that the stock market will grow faster than the economy. This suggests we should assume average total returns in real terms of around 5 per cent per year, most of which will come from dividends. This suggests that your portfolio could grow to around \u00a3800,000, which would give you an income in today's money of just over \u00a330,000 a year.</p><p>There is, of course, uncertainty around this.</p><p>Past volatility suggests you have a one-in-six chance of ending up with less than \u00a3650,000 and a one-in-six chance of more than \u00a3950,000.</p><p>I'm concerned that your future savings may be small. Savings aren't just a reliable way of increasing your wealth, they're also a form of risk management. If you save a lot, you can, in effect, hedge against a price fall by buying more when prices are low. Savings are also a way of hedging against changes in your future preferences. You might feel fine about working until you're 65 now, but by the time you are in your 50s you might not. More savings give you the option of quitting full-time work earlier.</p><p>James Norrington, specialist writer at Investors Chronicle, says: The Credit Suisse Investment Yearbook has found that the annualised long-run real rate of total return from global equities between 1900 and 2017 is 5.2 per cent. If matched over the next 30 years, this would give you \u00a3847,773 in today's money. That's enough for a reasonably comfortable retirement, especially if by that time you paid down any mortgage commitments.</p><p>But there is no guarantee of future performance. And there have been big variations in equity performance over 30-year periods - your investment timeframe. Between 1990 and 2018 global equities delivered annualised real returns of 4.6 per cent. That rate of return over the next 30 years would leave you with \u00a3714,098.</p><p>The annualised rate since 1990 is lower thanks to savage equity bear markets following the dot-com crash and during the financial crisis of 2007-09. These show the risk that stock markets could fall by more, peak-totrough, than the 30 per cent you can tolerate.</p><p>Andrea Solana, head of advanced planning at Maseco Private Wealth, says: Having dual US and UK citizenship means you have worldwide tax filing obligations to both jurisdictions as long as you remain a US citizen who is UK resident. The US also taxes certain income and investment products very differently to the UK. So, even if you structure a portfolio to be tax-efficient in the UK, the benefits could be undone by the punitive tax treatment of the same assets in the US.</p><p>Non-US regulated collective investments such as open-ended investment companies (Oeics), unit trusts or ETFs are known as Passive Foreign Investment Companies (PFIC). These carry annual informational reporting obligations on a US tax return and when gains are realised, they are generally taxed in the US at the highest marginal income tax rate, which is currently 37 per cent. And an interest charge is applied over the period of ownership. This is regardless of other sources of income.</p><p>US regulated collective investments that do not have UK reporting status attract offshore income gains (OIG) taxation as opposed to capital gains treatment in the UK. OIG assets do not benefit from the capital gains tax (CGT) allowance, and gains are taxed at their holder's relevant income tax band, for example, 40 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer as opposed to CGT at 20 per cent.</p><p>Direct shares and bond holdings, US regulated ETFs with UK reporting status, and US regulated mutual funds with UK reporting status can be held tax-efficiently by US citizens living in the UK, even outside a tax wrapper that is recognised by the US-UK income tax treaty such as an occupational pension scheme. This is also the case with cash deposits, but these are not suitable for a short-, medium-or long-term investment strategy given current interest rates.</p><p>As individual savings accounts (Isas) are not tax-exempt products from a US perspective, you should ensure that the investments you hold in your Isa are tax-efficient in the US, as any gains or income will be subject to US taxes.</p><p>Understanding the tax interactions between the US and the UK is essential if you are to achieve acceptable after-tax investment returns that will meet your long-term planning needs. Putting the maximum amount possible into workplace pension schemes, to the extent that your savings are for retirement goals, could be a valuable way to mitigate some US tax and receive tax relief on contributions.</p><p>Want to see your portfolio analysed by our experts? email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:portfolio.clinic@ft.com\">portfolio.clinic@ft.com</email> None of the commentary here should be regarded as advice. It is general information based on a snapshot of the reader's circumstances.</p><p>How to improve the portfolio The wisdom of this portfolio depends to a large extent on what your time horizon is. If it is 30 years then it's dangerous to hold even what seem to be the best stocks because we cannot predict how they'll cope with 30 years of creative destruction. So it's far wiser to back the field rather than particular horses.</p><p>And it's not certain that growth sectors such as biotech and information technology will be winners over a 30-year horizon. Over the past 30 years the best-performing UK sectors have included chemicals, tobacco and beverages, rather than conventional growth stocks. Valuations and sound business models matter more than growth, for which investors often pay too much.</p><p>As you are adjusting the portfolio every six months, however, your time horizon is in effect six months. This justifies otherwise questionable investments. For example, your stock holdings are mostly a play on whether investors will continue to want to pay more for monopoly-type stocks. This is a reasonable short-term bet. I fear, though, that there might come a point when investors overcorrect their past underpricing of such stocks, with the result that they'll end up overpriced.</p><p>And you would be better to consider Lyxor MSCI World Information Technology TR UCITS ETF (TNOG) as a play on momentum rather than on growth - like your Bitcoin holding is.</p><p>Regular rebalancing can be problematic depending on how you do it. Unaided judgment runs the risk that you fall victim to the countless errors we can make. So I'd remind you of the merits of the 10-month moving average rule, which says you should buy or hold when prices are above their 10-month or 200-day average, and sell when they are below it. This works much better with speculative assets.</p><p>Such a strategy won't always work: you will sometimes wrongly sell on dips. It will, however, protect you from the deep losses you can suffer in prolonged bear markets. And it'll protect you from holding onto bad investments in the forlorn hope of eventually breaking even.</p><p>James Norrington says: Although it is reasonable to have most of your investments in equities you would benefit from some diversification.</p><p>The rising interest rate environment in the US improves the rewards of diversifying some risk with US Treasuries. Their yield is now around 3 per cent, which is an unwarranted spread in terms of credit risk over comparable developed country debt. And there could be price appreciation if investors seek a safe haven in response to a sell-off in equities. As you have roots in the US these should be an attractive diversification option, although there could be dollar-sterling currency risk if you retire outside the US.</p><p>It is quite common for someone of your age in employment to have 80 per cent of their long-term assets in equities. But you can reduce risk if you are ahead of your long-term target returns. And the nearer you get to retirement, the more you should move into low-risk, short-duration government bonds. At that stage, a 50 per cent equity market fall would be harder to recover from.</p><p>I like that your equity allocation is internationally diverse. You have a high allocation to the US but, proportionately, the same would be true if you invested in a market-capitalised weighted global equities tracker fund.</p><p>You have taken thematic biases with your funds, which is fine if you believe areas such as tech and healthcare will make the best returns over the next 30 years. Doing this via collective investment vehicles is a sensible approach, as you are less exposed to individual companies failing.</p><p>I assume you hold iShares Core S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF (CSP1) for wholeof-market diversification, but this is hugely exposed to tech due to the enormous weighting of the so-called FAANGs - Facebook (US:FB), Amazon (US:AMZN), Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google, listed as Alphabet (US:GOOGL). On top of this you have a direct holding in Apple, which means you are especially vulnerable to the fortunes of big tech. This may turn out to be a good call over the long term, but you should be aware that when adding or selling investments your portfolio could be more concentrated in one sector than you think.</p><p>Andrea Solana says: You have a moderate risk tolerance and preference for collective funds, so that your portfolio is low-maintenance and more diversified. But consider diversifying across even more asset classes.</p><p>You should also be diversified across different geographies but have a bias to the US. The US represents about 55 per cent of global stock markets, so if your portfolio has an allocation to US equities of more than 55 per cent, it could be considered overweight in this area.</p><p>To maximise after-tax costs you need to consider the costs of investments, platforms, trading and tax. Your Isa is full of PFICs, which not only complicate annual filing requirements but can also result in high tax charges on gains realised in US dollars. Your Isa is viewed as a taxable account in the US, so it could be beneficial to focus it on direct share and direct bond holdings, and fixed-term deposits or cash.</p><p>If you want to invest in low-cost collective funds you should hold them in qualifying pension funds to avoid incurring PFIC issues, or in an account on a US platform that sells US regulated collectives with UK reporting status. US platforms are also generally cheaper than UK platforms, and these costs affect your overall net return.</p><p>Also, remember that the currency risk you are exposed to is that of the underlying investments within the funds you hold.</p><p>You are considering purchasing a house in the next three years. So consider lowering the risk profile of whatever proportion of your investments you think you will use for this, as three years is not enough time to ride out short-term volatility in equity markets. If you don't like bonds, hold a higher level of cash for this short-term need.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-138352546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SH8-K601-JBVM-Y4W7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 8, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>REITs, REMICs, RICs &amp; FASITs</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg2NTgxMTk4M0JFNDkzOEI3QkY3OTc3N0YyOTJGQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NThFNzVCQTRENzQ4NEIxQzkyQjVFQTI5NUY5QjE3RTU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Tax Treaties</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkM0QkNCM0UyRkUzNDk0RjgxREIyOUZEMDI3QzA3QTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkUzNUQ1QThGRkM4NENGNzg5MTdFN0VBMzFFMUFFRTg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000518</classCode><className>DIVIDENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N525910MM</classCode><className>EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001307</classCode><className>PENSION &amp; RETIREMENT PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000298</classCode><className>CITIZENSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001493</classCode><className>RETIREMENT &amp; RETIREES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N525910MM</classCode><className>EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001307</classCode><className>PENSION &amp; RETIREMENT PLANS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Some call it regulation, I call it online nationalism which controls who peddles what on the Net. They laughed at what they thought was a Luddite proposal.</p><p>I was thinking something on the lines of an Intranet for individual countries, a system which China has already put in place right under our noses and uncritical eyes with a great degree of success (WeChat, Sina Weibo, Tencent, Youku, Baidu, Alibaba, anyone?). Regulated? Yes. Censored? Depends on which way you look at it. Tech watchers call it the Great Firewall of China where only government sanctioned apps and social networks are allowed to flourish. \"But that's China,\" they said. \"If China can do it why can't other countries come up with online communities and networks that chat, buy and sell?\" I countered.</p><p>Think about it. In most parts of the world, retail, ads, rides, media and relationships have been dominated by Western online companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Uber. That's unfair. They swallow up competition and restrict innovation in the name of disruption.</p><p>I believe governments should frame rules to disrupt Big Tech's foreign expansions (and private incursions). Why shouldn't countries intervene and stop them from monopolising our lives? Something sovereign, something unique ... country-specific online ecosystems that protect national interests in all sectors is an idea that has already seen a fair amount of success in controlled environments like China.</p><p>But China is different, said my critics who thought I was talking of going back to the dark Internet age. I reminded them that we are already in one, where the Dark Net and Deep Dark Net indeed exist.</p><p>Moscow even pulled the plug on the Web recently, albeit briefly to see if the system works in an emergency, like a cyberattack. The country's parliament, the Duma, passed a bill in April that allows the government to move traffic away from foreign servers. All to prevent a foreign power from shutting down Russia's Net if all hell breaks loose.</p><p>It's a form of censorship, digital slavery, critics point out. Our privacy is taken for granted and we are okay with it, so why complain when the Net is not cast wider? If Big Brother ain't watching you, Big Tech will. Same difference. The new technocratic order knows what is best for you - they read minds, they listen in while you transact and connect through them. Now there's a growing disenchantment in democracies in Europe and the United States against Big Tech. Politicians fear the rise of an all-powerful virtual technocracy that threatens their governing interests.</p><p>So when liberal Democrats in the US who once drooled over Silicon Valley want large technology companies regulated or splintered, I was both intrigued and interested in what they had to say.</p><p>\"Today, everything is connected to the Internet; it is the foundation on which our economy, democracy and attention rest,\" US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said glibly. \"Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy - especially when digital platforms control content. The era of self-regulation is over,\" she tweeted after she was the victim of a morphing attach.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats cutting across party lines are concerned about Facebook and Google's dominance. An antitrust probe is being readied - the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department will lead those investigations that will determine whether Big Tech is killing competition, innovation and entrepreneurship.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Europe, Facebook, Google and Apple, are being slapped with fines for alleged tax evasion, privacy and </p><p>A Democratic candidate for the US presidential election, Elizabeth Warren, has even suggested that Big Tech companies be broken up to protect national interests and local businesses. Her plan envisages Amazon giving up control of Whole Foods, an organic food company, and for Facebook to spin off WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>She argues that these tech firms are a platform, \"a place where people come to buy and sell goods.\" They also collect, aggregate information about people and use that data to lure people back into that platform - a perfect recipe for domination after they crush the competition.</p><p>The truth is this - Big Tech has gotten too big, and we didn't see them coming. And even if we did, businesses on the ground and governments didn't bother to frame the rules of engagement. To salvage the situation a global online regulatory mechanism is in order. Europe has taking baby steps on this; the US is following suit. It's still a broken-down approach but China is ahead of the game with its own virtual ecosystem in place.</p><p>If countries and global business cannot breach the Great Firewall of China, why not create their own versions to protect national interests and businesses? The liberals will say it goes against the grain of globalisation. I say, the Internet is broken anyway.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:allan@khaleejtimes.com\">allan@khaleejtimes.com</email></p><p><br/>Allan Jacob A news junkie with an abiding interest in foreign affairs.

The more sceptical investors become about the quality of earnings the more wary creditors will become about lending to companies which engage in such subterfuge. This is already taking its toll on the ability of needy companies to borrow. Corporate bond spreads have begun to widen again while commercial paper issuance by the non-financial sector continues to decline. BAA corporate bond spreads over 10-year US treasuries have risen by 21bps since reaching a recent low of 278bps on 28 January. Non-financial sector commercial paper outstanding has fallen to US$ 206bn from the peak of US$ 364bn reached in September 2000.</p><p>All of this threatens to postpone the hoped for pick up in American capital spending. Instead America's corporate sector will continue to deleverage, which is deflationary. Absolute investors should go long again US government bonds, if they have not already done so. They should also go long eurodollar futures. The Federal funds rate is not going to be at the 3.1% level which the money markets are at present discounting at the end of this year. This seems fantasy unless the dollar collapses. For now, at least, the American currency remains remarkably resilient as foreigners continue to ignore the evidence of gathering credit rot stateside.</p><p>But if quality government bonds remain a preferred option for investors, even if they are in Asia, they should also keep an eye on the American corporate bond market. It was a feature of the early 1930s that government bond yields kept declining as corporate bond yields spiked as a consequence of mounting credit revulsion. The same symptoms are becoming visible in America today. It is therefore of interest that American banks have a growing exposure to the American corporate bond market as they reach for yield. These securitised loans may appear more liquid but they can, like emerging market equities, become illiquid in a crisis. In this respect GREED &amp; fear is grateful to legendary CLSA investment guru Russell Napier for revealing another alarming aspect of America's terrifying credit bubble. This is that between 1992 and 1999 the management of American commercial banks granted themselves, via options, the potential rights of ownership to nearly 8% of the American banking system!</p><p>This has created an obvious incentive to manipulate earnings in this key sector, most notably to under provision. Non-performing assets of the 25 largest US banks increased by US$ 2,9bn or 9% in 4Q01, despite charge-offs of US$ 8.8bn, according to a recent report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The commercial bankers turned would-be investment bankers will continue to weave and dodge as they seek investment banking mandates by \"lending their balance sheets\". But the American banking sector peaked three and a half years ago and has significantly further to fall since the real downside will only occur when the consumer finally starts deleveraging. The S&amp;P 500 Banks Index is so far down 22% from the peak level reached in July 1998.</p><p>The inevitable climax of credit contraction is being delayed primarily by foreigners' continued willingness to buy the debt of the federal mortgage agencies who in turn finance the mortgage refinancing stimulus that is the main prop for consumer sentiment. In this respect it is worth noting that the Japanese banking index reached a peak in 1987, two and a half years before the debt deflation really got underway there. At that peak the Japanese banking sector accounted for more than 20% of the MSCI EAFE Index based on GREED &amp; fear's memory. The same process is now under way in America. As for the lure of options this form of remuneration will, in due course, be regulated out of existence like so many other aspects of modern American financial life. The reason is that it will be realised that the interests of shareholders and option-holding corporate officials are not aligned. For the former have capital at risk whereas the latter have little to none. They do, however, have every incentive to put short-term share price appreciation ahead of all other considerations, including the payment of dividends.</p><p>The danger of such incentives at play in institutions enjoying the blanket guarantee of federal deposit insurance is obvious. This unfortunate situation will at some point in the future occupy the attention of America's earnest congressmen and their ever zealous staff. But for now they are worrying about accounting issues, a trail which will fast take them from auditors to investment banks' structured finance departments. Even GREED &amp; fear was gobsmacked to read this week that Enron executives were rewarded financially for a constant stream of profitable transactions calculated on the NPV of a deal, booked when the deal closed. This was the case even though the deal may have to run for many years. Such one-sided arrangements would seem a case of business school finance gone bonkers.</p><p>The explosion may have been Enron. But for tech-oriented Asia the three important heavyweight names which will most affect market sentiment are Intel, IBM and Microsoft. These three companies still have a combined market capitalisation of US$ 706bn, equivalent to about 42% of the combined market capitalisation for the Asia ex Japan equity universe, down from a peak of 70% reached in January 1999 (see chart below). It is, therefore, of note to see the latest questioning of IBM's accounting practices. The company has been criticised for describing the sale of a subsidiary as \"intellectual property income\". With the spotlight back on the accuracy or otherwise of the big tech names' earnings numbers, GREED &amp; fear would advise investors to look at the revenue trend. In the specific case of IBM it is necessary to break down the revenues between hardware sales and the growth of revenues in the much touted global services unit where much of the bullish argument for the company has been focused in recent years. Both categories are now showing declining sales growth on a quarterly basis. Sales of global services and hardware declined by 1.4%YoY and 24%YoY in 4Q01. More importantly, growth rates have been slowing for the past three quarters in both hardware and services.</p><p>IBM is a classic example of a company ripe for multiple compression. Another is General Electric which, proactively, announced a change in its own reporting methodology this week. It is the massive potential for multiple compression, as much as the trend in profits per se, which explains why the American bear market is far from over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKVWS-Ftr3837FtrId6098 Banks;

Listen  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HAMEED DERWEESH, IRAQI NATIONAL DETAINED:  The greatest nation, the greatest people in the world.  A special immigration visa on my passport with my family because I work with the U.S. government.  I support the U.S. government on the other side of the world.  But when I came here, they said, nope.  They kick me out as if I break the rules or do something wrong.  I'm surprised really.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW:  That was Hameed Derweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. government during the Iraq war.  </p><p>The New York Congressman Jarrod Nadler said 11 others are detained at this hour at JFK.  </p><p>This travel ban affects seven Muslim majority nations.  It stops admission of all refugees to the United States temporarily for four months.  Confusion and chaos rippling through law enforcement agencies, airports and international cities as people try to wrap their head around what this all means.  </p><p>this comes amid a world of diplomacy for President Trump.  He just wrapped up phone calls with five world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.  </p><p>We have all of this covered this hour.</p><p>I want to begin with Rachel Crane, at New York's JFK Airport.  </p><p>Rachel, first, let's begin with the Iraqi man who worked for the U.S. military as an interpreter, just being released after being detained for a number of hours.  Do we know why he was released, on what grounds?  </p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Poppy, to begin with, Darweesh was released, as you just heard.  He was praising America, saying Americans were the best people in the world.  </p><p>Now, it's unclear why Darweesh was held and detained here.  He was traveling with three children and his wife and they were not detained. That just highlighted how random the executive order was and the application of it.  His family was not detained, but only him.  </p><p>Now a source close to the case indicated to CNN that there is a provision for the State and Department of Homeland Security to make exemptions for certain people.</p><p>But listen to what Darweesh had to say about the ordeal.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARWEESH:  I just went through the terminal and give my passport that I gave from the U.S. embassy all the documents and say, don't open it. They give it to the officer, and then ask me to move in a different room and say -- actually, they don't say anything, but they keep me there until those people come to support me.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER:  You stay in the same room the whole time?  </p><p>DARWEESH:  Yeah, for about two days.  They move me to other room but I sit on chair.  I didn't sleep.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRANE:  Now, Poppy, when asked what his message to Donald Trump was, Darweesh said he liked the man but is confused about this policy.  </p><p>Any minute, a press conference will be held where hopefully we'll have an update about the remaining detainees at JFK -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  I know a lawsuit has been filed by attorneys representing them, arguing basically this ban is unconstitutional, citing the establishment cause and the Fifth Amendment.  What do we know about the lawsuit and where it stands?  </p><p>CRANE:  The lawsuit was filed today.  And one of the plaintiffs is still being detained here at JFK.  We know that he was granted a visa refugee status and his wife and child had been in the U.S. for about two years, also granted refugee status.  That Iraqi man had gone under on the exhaustive process of applying for refugee status.</p><p>And earlier today, we got a chance to speak with Congressman Nadler and he indicated that the 11 -- I'm sorry -- 10 of the other detainees did not have legal representation -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  Rachel, thank you very much. </p><p>Other questions about what this means for people holding green cards. Some sources telling CNN that the president's executive action on immigration and refugees could affect those who already hold green cards.  Also, possibly, and specifically those from the seven countries highlighted there, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen.   Ryan Nobles joining us from the White House for more clarity on this. </p><p>So, what we're hearing, Ryan, is that this is a case by case basis. Right?  This isn't all green card holders from the seven countries. They're going to take this one by one, is that correct?  </p><p>[15:05:00]  RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, that's the way the administration is describing it, but there's a bit of confusion.  </p><p>So, let's try to hash this out the best we can.  If you hold a green card, an active green card that makes you a permanent legal resident of the United States but come from one of the seven countries that the administration designated as possible hot beds of terrorism, then you must go through a process, you must submit a waiver before you can return to the United States.  Essentially, if you go to the airport and try to buy a plane ticket, you'll be denied at that point, and have to go through a process, and no telling how long or short that process will be.  It's not officially been revealed exactly how the Department of Homeland Security will handle these waivers.</p><p>And it's also important to point out, Poppy, if you are a green card holder, you've already gone through a lengthy vetting process by the United States government that allowed you to obtain that important document.  It's unclear right now exactly what the next steps will be for these green card holders.  At the very least, this could impact tens of thousands of people who, for the most part, are American residents, even though not necessarily citizens from the United States.  And there are administration sources telling CNN, who happen to be a co-holder from one of the countries that are impacted, their advice to you in terms of travel is to stay here in the United States -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  We know that tech companies, a number of big tech companies, including Google, have told their employees in the last 24 hours, do not travel out of the United States if there is any chance that this could affect you.  So, there's a lot of questions, certainly, through corporate America right now as well.  </p><p>Ryan Nobles, at the White House, thank you for that.  </p><p>When you look at the specific travel bans, in Iran, the response is, they are slapping their own ban on the United States, saying, no U.S. citizens allowed to enter Iran, they say, for as long as President Trump's order is in effect.  </p><p>Our Ben Wedeman joining me now from Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Ben, a lot to get to here.  I thought it was interesting that Iran and its response said that this will only embolden extremists and their supporters.  </p><p>BED WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that came in a foreign ministry statement out of Tehran.  They said, among other things, that this is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular, the great nation of Iran.  That according to the statement from the foreign ministry.   And it's not just Iran that is considering these measures.  We've heard members of the Iraqi parliament suggesting that Iraq take the same sort of measures.  And that's particularly problematic when you consider that there are more than 5,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq supporting that country's effort to destroy ISIS.  </p><p>So, when you speak to a variety of people, I've been in touch, for instance, with a former member of U.S. Special Forces who served in Afghanistan and Iraq.  He says when this sort of message goes out, it puts the lives of U.S. military personnel in danger -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  I think it's very important to note for viewers, of the seven countries -- and let's hold them back on the screen -- and what this ban extends to, this four-month ban on any refugees, this does not include any of the countries where the 9/11 terrorists were from, most from Saudi Arabia non-included.  Egypt is non-included.  And Lebanon is not included.  </p><p>WEDEMAN:  It's important to keep in mind, particularly when you consider the man who participated in the San Bernardino attack, who left 14 U.S. citizens dead, he originally came from Pakistan.  His wife was Pakistani, entered the country not as a refugee but on the fiance visa program.  </p><p>But yes, look at Saudi Arabia.  16 of the 19 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia.  Ad most who know the Middle East will tell you that the ideology that inspires al Qaeda and ISIS originates in Saudi Arabia. But reasons that have not become clear, Saudi Arabia, nor Pakistan is on this list of seven predominantly Muslim nations listed in the executive order -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  You're in Istanbul, Turkey.  And for the better part of two years, Istanbul, Turkey, in general, has become increasingly unstable. President Erdogan is fighting back against the coup attempt.  What are people saying today in Istanbul about concerns that perhaps Turkey may be at it?  </p><p>[15:10:11]  WEDEMAN:  Nobody is particularly concerned that Turkey will be added.  Let's not forget that Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance, that there is a U.S. military basis.  </p><p>But people, on a gut level, look at this ban and, even though it's seven countries, more than one million pop and most Muslim affected by the ban so we are offended.  And the Turkish prime minister and the British prime minister asked pointed questions from reporters about this ban, and both Theresa May and the Turkish prime minister avoided the questions because, obviously, relations with the United States at the minute are sensitive so they try to stay away from it.  But at street level, widespread revulsion at this decision by the United States -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  And I should know, Ben, but as someone who has covered all of the years, your take on what Donald Trump said when asked by a reporter about whether Christians would be given priority in terms of refugees trying to come into this country?   WEDEMAN:  Certainly, Christians have been victims of ISIS, victims of oppression, victims of a rising sentiment of Islamic fundamentalism that they pay a price for.  But if you look at the actual numbers, the number of Christians admitted to the United States as refugees is more or less reflective of their proportion of the population.  It is not true that it is impossible for Christians to enter the country, the United States, as refugees.  It's just as difficult for them as it is for Muslims as well to get in.  And when the president differentiates between Muslims and Christians, this causes a certain amount of resentment among the Muslim majorities.  It's another problematic issue where a very simplistic solution is being applied to a very complicated problem -- Poppy?  </p><p>HARLOW:  Ben Wedeman live for us in Istanbul.  Ben, thank you so much for the report.  </p><p>We have a lot ahead this hour.  Much more on our breaking news. You'll hear from a refugee family who just arrived in the United States.  Now they fear they'll have to return to war-torn Syria.  </p><p>And later, Ed Lavandera brings us an extraordinary in-depth series about the wall.  </p><p>Hi, Ed.  </p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Poppy, we're taking a nearly two- dozen-mile journey along the southern border with Mexico, from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California.  Join us as we capture the snapshots and the voices of the people who called the borderland home.  </p><p>HARLOW:  It is an incredible series.  You'll see all right here over the next three hours.  </p><p>Stay with us.  You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:16:49]  HARLOW:  Right now, President Trump's travel ban for 7 Muslim majority nations is sending shock waves across airports and international cities.  A few hours ago, an Iraqi man who worked for the U.S. government, the military, specifically, for a decade was detained at New York's JFK Airport.  He was recently released.  New York Congressman Jerrod Nadler said 11 others are still being held there.  </p><p>And a lawsuit has been filed challenging the president's ban which holds immigration from the seven Muslim-majority nations -- you see them on the screen -- and completely halts the refugee program.  </p><p>Let's talk it out with our panel, Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court reporter; Josh Rogin, of \"The Washington Post,\" the columnist there; Betsy Woodruff, politics reporter for \"The Daily Beast\"; and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart, formerly Ted Cruz's communications director.  </p><p>Great to be with you.  </p><p>(CROSSTAKL)</p><p>Ariane, if you could begin, and go through this lawsuit.  This is the first real legal challenge that the president on his executive order. Explain what's the argument is here.  Are they saying it's unconstitutional because of the establishment clause, the Fifth Amendment?  What's the argument?</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REOPRTER:  There are several due process claims.  But one of the big claims is discrimination based on religion. And what the president could come back and say here is, look, when it comes to immigration, I have broad authority.  But other people might come back and say, look, in this case, you've gone too far.  </p><p>But what is most interesting about this lawsuit is it provides this road map for one man's journey, his legal journey.  Hameed Darweesh, several years ago, worked as a contractor the U.S. government.  He began to feel retaliation and wanted to apply for one of these visas. He went through a three-year process to do it, and that included meeting with somebody at the mission.  He gets the visa.  He gets on an airplane and lands last night, and when he gets there, he's told, look, you can't come in.  His lawyers were waiting.  They went to customs and said, why aren't you letting him in?  And the response was talk to Mr. Trump.  So, this is the start of many lawsuits we might see coming down the road.  He's now been released but there are others in the pipeline.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Alice, to you, and something our Ben Wedeman was just talking about, the fact that, you know, none of the 9/11 hijackers, from the UAE, Egypt, Lebanon, and most from Saudi Arabia, are not included on this travel ban.  None of the countries are included.  And when you look at the most recent attacks in France, for example, \"Charlie Hebdo,\" you had three French nationals of Algeria descent, and Paris attacks over a year ago, mainly French and Belgian nationals of Moroccan descent.  None of those countries are part of this travel ban.  Why is that?  </p><p>ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT:  I certainly trust our national security officials that did picked the seven nations that are affected here, specifically, Syria and Iraq, which are ISIS strongholds, and that is the reason they picked these nations.  And the vetting process clearly didn't meet the standards necessary to execute this.  </p><p>I think it's important to go back to the origin of the executive order.  It is to protect all Americans from foreign nationals who intend to come to this country to carry out terrorist acts.  And, look, our country, our national security agencies must be right 100 percent of the time.  Terrorists only need to be correct one time.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[15:20:31]  STEWART:  I think this is an important step, but it's necessary to be done.   And, look, there's going to be hiccups with any kind of major rollout like this.  I remind you, healthcare.gov, Obama administration had months and millions of dollars to execute that and they failed.  </p><p>I think what we're seeing now is unfortunate, and clearly frustrating for those who are detained at the airport.  But I do understand the proper procedures are in place to smooth things out in order to execute this executive order in a more smooth way.  </p><p>HARLOW:  But, Alice, I want to pull up these two pictures.  You can look.  These are two little boys, two victims of the civil war in Syria, as you know.  This boy washed up dead on the beach after his family tried to flee.  This boy's family's home bombed in Aleppo.  He survived.  Some of his family members died.  These are also people who will not be allowed refuge in the United States.  </p><p>And this executive order does not create a safe zone within Syria for them to go, something that President Trump said when he was campaigning and then it's not there.  It affects these people as well. </p><p>STEWART:  And those images are chilling and heartbreaking, and no one can look at those pictures and not be devastated by them.  But, look, Donald Trump made it clear while he was campaigning, and since he's been president, that his number-one priority is the safety and security for Americans.  And this executive order is to do just that, to protect Americans here in our country from those who intend to come here and do harm.  </p><p>HARLOW:  However, Alice, he could have written in there a clause allowing, say, mothers and their children to come, and their infants to come.  Would you have liked to see that?  </p><p>STEWART:  Look, look at what we have in San Bernardino.  This is one of the key people involved in that that was a female --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>JOSH ROGIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST:  From Pakistan.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Yeah.</p><p>STEWART:  -- every single rule.   And it's important to put down a firm line.  This was certainly a bold move and there's going to be changes to it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Except, Alice --</p><p>STEWART:  So it's important to take a bold step.</p><p>HARLOW:  Except, Alice, that's just not factual.  The male attacker in San Bernardino was born in Illinois to Pakistani parents, and Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan, moved to Saudi Arabia, and came to the U.S.  So, that's not a comparison.  That's not factual to say, look at what happened in San Bernardino.   STEWART:  My point is that, certainly our hearts go out to everyone that's a Syrian refugee and needs to come here, but we can't just look at women and children as across-the-board innocent in this. because some have played a role, specifically women, in some of these acts. So, I think it's important to have a firm line in the sand and that's exactly what's happening here.  </p><p>HARLOW:  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll be back with my panel in just a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:27:10]  HARLOW:  All right.  My panel is back with me as we continue to discuss the breaking news.  </p><p>We're also waiting for a statement from some lawmakers at JFK Airport. </p><p>Josh Rogin, let's go to the point about the fact that not contained in this executive order are safe zones in Syria.  Do we know why?  The president talked about this campaigning.  </p><p>ROGIN:  It was one of his campaign promises.  We're told there were objections from national security officials within the Trump administration because of the requirements and sources it would take from the U.S. military in order to implement the safe zones.  I think they're still working on it.  Let's see what happens down the road.  </p><p>But I also want to address the point about which countries were and were not included in the list.  Let's remember that the total number of terrorist attacks carried out in America from these countries is zero.  Zero.  In addition to the ones you mentioned, there was the Christmas Day bomber from Nigeria, the Orlando bomber from Afghani descent, and the San Bernardino bomber who was Pakistan, and the Times Square from Pakistan.  The arbitrary nature of choosing these countries is a huge problem.  </p><p>And I recall Theresa May speaking to the Republican conference in Philadelphia, and what she said was not only combat terrorism militarily but the ideology of terrorism, and the way to do that is by not giving in to the narrative that U.S. isn't at war with a religion, and that was a viewed shared by George W. Bush.  That's been eroded today.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Guys, stand by, if you would.</p><p>I want to go to JFK Airport in New York.  Democratic Congressman Jerrod Nadler, speaking, and Democratic Congressman Nydia Velazquez. Let's listen.</p><p>REP. JERROD NADLER (D), NEW YORK:  I want to make two major point. First, the executive order signed by President Trump is discriminatory, on religion, and, frankly, quite disgusting.  It is also counterproductive.  The expressed intent to protect the United States against terrorists.  </p><p>But the fact of the matter is not a single terrorist incident since before 9/11 has been caused by anyone from the seven countries that the president named.  By contrast, a country like Saudi Arabia, which produced most of the attackers on September 11th, is not covered by this order.  </p><p>Secondly, the refugees who have valid visas, the president said he wants extreme vetting.  We've been doing extreme vetting for years. For years, we've been doing vetting.  All of these refugees have been and the records looked into for an average of two years, two years, by American authorities.  </p><p>[15:30:00] The person who was held and released this morning, finally, released this morning, Hameed Darweesh, who was detained overnight was a marked man in Iraq because he served as interpreter and worked with American troops.  He helped the U.S. Army for years.  He's not a potential terrorist.  </p><p>So, it's counterproductive, ridiculous, and discriminates on the basis of religion.  Christians from these countries are allowed in.  Only Muslims are not.  And that goes against our tradition, from George Washington onward, and it doesn't help protect the United States.  </p><p>The second point is that the application of this, in dealing with the people we have here today, is particularly ridiculous.  Even if you said that you wanted to keep people from certain countries out of the United States, once you have vetted certain people, once the American staff people, the State Department people, the military people have looked at a given individual and said, this person is no threat, they've looked at him for two years and given him a valid visa and then, while in the air, this executive order comes out.  He should be permitted to enter the country.  People would not be permitted to get on a plane, but people in the air should not be taken to custody in this country.  That makes no sense at all.  Because, after all, the timing of the order with the one day earlier, one day later, is entirely based on happenstance.  And people have been coming into this country from these countries, and one more day for people who got valid visas would make no difference at all.  </p><p>So, a wooden application makes no sense and an unconstitutional and disgusting application on the basis of religious discrimination violates every tradition of this country and we're here to say they should stop and should be revoked.  </p><p>Nydia.</p><p>REP. NYDIA VELAZQUEZ (D), NEW YORK:  Thank you.  </p><p>I'm Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, and I represent the 7th congressional district, that has a lot of working families, a lot of immigrant families.  </p><p>Mr. President, look at us.  This is America.  What you have done is shameful.  It's un-American.  And it's created so much confusion, not only among working families and families in America, but also, it's creating confusion with the people that are working in homeland security.  This executive order is arbitrary.  It doesn't provide real guidelines.  And it's unjust.  Here we have refugees who were granted legal visas to enter this country and yet, they have been detained illegally.  That is the argument that Jerrod and I and the refugees project is making.  I am begging you to go and reverse it.  It is ill advised.  It's mean spirited.  It's tearing families apart.  And that is not who we are.  It will undermine the cooperation and collaboration that we need from Muslim countries to fight terrorism. It is wrong.  And we will fight it today and every single day.  </p><p>HARLOW:  You heard from two Democratic representatives at JFK Airport. </p><p>Let me go back to my panel.</p><p>Betsy, I'd like your reaction to this.  Back in 2015, now Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, tweeted this, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are offensive and unconstitutional.\"  He also tweeted, \"Our Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion, the U.S. cannot discriminate on the basis of religion.\"  </p><p>Does this put the administration on a complicated and not united front on this?  </p><p>BETSY WOODRUFF, POLITICS REPORTER, THE DAILY BEAST:  Without a doubt. Pence and his allies, including congressional Republicans, argue this executive order isn't technically a Muslim ban.  They point out that many other majority countries, like Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia --</p><p>ROGIN:  Turkey.</p><p>HARLOW:  Right.</p><p>WOODRUFF:  -- are not included.  They argue that that means everything works together.  Of course, we can expect critics to bring up this tweet and this sentiment that Pence shares to make the case that, look, if you're banning people from the majority Muslim countries but carve out refugees who aren't Muslim, that in practice is what a Muslim ban looks like.  And Pence made such a strong statement that sounded very principled so recently, without a doubt, it undermines the administration's rhetoric on this.  A lot of tweets will come back to haunt Vice President Pence.  </p><p>[15:35:27]  HARLOW:  Alice, final word to you.  For those who call this basically a ban on Muslims or a religious test that's cloaked as something else, you say?  </p><p>STEWART:  That's absolutely not factually correct.  This is not about religion.  There's no religious test to get into this country as a result of this executive order.  And that's completely missing the point.  It gives the lawyers an argument to -- a legal leg to stand on, but that does not, any aspect of this executive order.</p><p>And I go back once again to the primary focus of this executive action is to protect all American from terrorists that try to come in this country and do us harm.  That's the goal, the focus, and that is the underlying message of what this is about.  And the countries picked - yes, Joshua is correct -- none of the terrorist acts -- people who came in to carried out terrorist acts have come from these countries, but I trust our national security experts as to why they picked these seven countries, based on where ISIS currently is.  And we also have to remember ISIS has grown significantly due to the fact that the Obama administration failed to stand firm on the red line in Syria, and that's caused the growth of ISIS.  So, I think the Democrats have to take some of the blame for the growth of this problem in the first place.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Thank you all.  We appreciate it, Ariane, Alice, Betsy and Josh.  </p><p>Still to come, the major of New Orleans will join me live.  He says the police in New Orleans will not be part of the president's, quote, \"deportation force.\"  We're talking about sanctuary cities.  Mayor Mitch Landrieu joins me next.</p><p>You're Live in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:40:15]  HARLOW:  Welcome back.  You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Poppy Harlow.  </p><p>As we continue to follow the breaking news, let's get to another executive order signed on Wednesday.  President Trump signed an order to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities.  </p><p>New Orleans is such a city, but it's mayor, Mitch Landrieu, said that the city complies with all federal lay and is not in danger of losing any money.  </p><p>And just to give you a sense of what this means, this is a city where the local law enforcement doesn't necessarily report or turn over undocumented people in this city to ICE or immigration officials.  </p><p>In a strongly worded statement, the mayor said, \"The NOPD will not meet the deportation force and live from New Orleans.\"  </p><p>Mayor Landrieu joins us now.</p><p>Good to have you on.  </p><p>MITCH LANDREIU, (D), NEW ORLEANS LAW:  Poppy, thanks for having me.  </p><p>HARLOW:  As you know, this could cost the city of New Orleans heavily when it comes to federal funding.  Being told, you said we're not going to comply with this.  You believe you're in line with the law. Why do you think this isn't going to cost the city any federal funds?  </p><p>LANDRIEU:  Let me make a couple of general comments about the executive orders the president signed in the last couple of days.  </p><p>First of all, mayors across America understand the first priority is to keep America safe.  From looking at the occurrences recently in Boston, New York, San Bernardino, it's actually local law enforcement that are the tip of the spear in the fight against terrorism to protect national security and public safety.  We understand our jobs. And the mayors and police chiefs of America along with the U.S. Conference of Bishops looked at both of these executive orders and concluded that they are un-American and, in some instances, arguably, unchristian.  And are not going to keep us safe.  </p><p>We need communion with the people who we're responsible to take care of, and if you turn local police departments to the de facto ICE agents for the United States of America, we'll push people back in the shadows and not have the cooperation we need and not able to keep the streets of America safe.  The mayors presented a plan to the president of the United States about how to keep the streets of America safe and we look forward to talking with them how to do it.  </p><p>The city of New Orleans right now is in compliance with all federal laws and regulations.  If we take somebody off the street with respect to committing a violent crime and going to jail and get deported, that's really not the issue on the table.  The issue on the table is whether or not our police departments are asked to be part of the ICE deportation force to separate families.  And I think most of us understand and the police chiefs in America know that's not going to make America safer but hurt us.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Have you gotten any response from the president or anyone at the White House to basically your defiance of this executive order?  </p><p>LANDRIEU:  Well, first of all, the executive order is unconstitutional for a number of different reasons.  Number one, there is no definition in federal law what a sanctuary city is.  That's going to surprise Americans, but there's no definition in the law of what it is.  </p><p>And secondly, the federal law is fairly clear, based on the interpretations of the Supreme Court, that you cannot compel cities do things under threats of losing funds.</p><p>Thirdly, this doesn't seem to make sure.  We want to help you make the city safer, Mayors, but the one way to punish you is to take funds away from Homeland Security and the police department that are charged with making the city safe.  </p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  As you know, Mayor, it's a way to compel you.  </p><p>LANDRIEU:  I understand that -- I understand that, but you don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  I suggest to the president and the vice president, look at our secure America plan, which calls for the hiring of 50,000 police officers trained in community policing, supporting funding for the DEA, ATF, FBI and U.S. Marshals and U.S. attorneys, to give the attorney general direct action to take cases against individuals with gun crimes, and then invest in domestic violence and substance abuse programs as well as early childhood education.  We did this some time ago in this country and we reduced crime rate by half.  We can do that again with smart policies that are also tough.  But we ought to maintain our values, our Judeo-Christian values and also our American values as American continues to shine the light of freedom across America and the world.   HARLOW:  Mayor, I understand that you believe -- and I'm sure your attorneys in the city there have checked this out -- and they maintain that the cities in compliance with federal law, as you see it. However, if the administration does follow through and does pull federal funding from the city of New Orleans, which, as you noted, helps support your police department, helps support you in the case of a natural disaster, will you stand your ground?  Will you maintain the city's status as a sanctuary city?  </p><p>LANDRIEU:  First of all, again, as I said, there is no definition of a sanctuary city.  And second of all -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW:  Will you maintain your practice?  </p><p>[15:45:12]  LANDRIEU:  Let me -- let me finish, if I might.  </p><p>We are practicing the law that has been directed to us by a federal judge.  We cannot be out of compliance with federal legal law because we're following a federal court order.  The president's executive order doesn't trump a federal judge's order, not in anybody's imagination.  We're feel like we're in compliance and we're going to continue to be.</p><p>And I want to stress this to the people of America.  The mayors of America are interested in making sure that violent criminals, irrespective of the immigration status, are taken off the streets of the city.  And we do cooperate with them on those matters and will continue to do so.  </p><p>It's when you get into trying to separate families and destroy neighborhoods and hurt the economy and, basically, make the cities more insecure than they already are, that we'll say, listen, we've got to find a better way to do this.  Work with us.  We want to work with you.  </p><p>#  Mayor Mitch Landrieu, I appreciate it.  I'll be in your beautiful city in just about two weeks.  Thank you very much. </p><p>LANDRIEU:  Oh, that's great.  Hope you have a great time.  </p><p>HARLOW:  See you there.  Thank you.  </p><p>HARLOW:  Straight ahead for us, it's an issue at the center of President Trump's agenda, what people living along the border between the United States and Mexico are saying about his plans for a wall.  A special three-part series begins next.  </p><p>You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[14:50:05]  HARLOW:  Our CNN national correspondent, Ed Lavandera, has spent the last two months traveling the length of the United States border with Mexico.  And as President Donald Trump rounds out his first week in office, border issues, not surprisingly, are at the center of his agenda.  </p><p>Over the next three hours, you'll see an extraordinary in-depth series, one that captures snapshots of life and the voices of the people who call the borderlands home.  </p><p>Part one takes us to Texas.  That state spans 1,250 miles of border with Mexico, more than any state.  And for Texans the issue of immigration is far from simple.  </p><p>Here's our Ed Lavandera.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This journey across the U.S./Mexico border begins in south Texas where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico.  And on a rugged ride in an all-terrain vehicle with Robert Cameron, who runs an ATV border tour business, in the small town of Progresso.  </p><p>(voice-over):  Do you think people have that impression of the border? A scary, dangerous place.</p><p>ROGERT CAMERON, MANAGER, ATV BORDER TOUR BUSINESS:  Oh.  Scary, dangerous place, absolutely.  Not as bad as people make it seem to be. </p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  Cameron was born in Mexico.  Is now a U.S. citizen.  Was a long-time Democrat until Donald Trump came along, and made him a Republican.  </p><p>Living and working on the border reveals a blurry reality.  Cameron fully supports the idea of Trump's border wall.  But every day, he sees the holes in that plan.  </p><p>(on camera):  This is part of the border wall that already exists, right?  </p><p>CAMERON:  Exactly.  Exactly.  This is put back in 2006 by George Bush. It's been around for a while.  </p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  A few months ago, while riding along the Rio Grande, he recorded this video of what appeared to be smugglers with packs.  It's the kind of story countless people along the border can share.  </p><p>But this is an area where a border fence is already in place.  Yet drugs and human smuggling keep coming.  </p><p>CAMERON:  It hasn't stopped them.  No, absolutely not.  </p><p>You got this wall all the way around that the eye can see all the way over there.  </p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  It keeps going.</p><p>CAMERON:  It keeps going.  And then it's like -- they start here.  I don't know.  I'm sure there's a reason.  Wouldn't you think?  They ran out of money?  </p><p>LAVANDERA:  This is the landscape in the Big Bend area of Texas. That's the challenge, how in the world do you build a wall in this kind of terrain?  </p><p>(voice-over):  Marco Sparedes (ph) lives in Terlingua (ph), a far- flung outpost in the Big Bend region of west Texas.  He's a former Big Bend Park ranger who now takes visitors on aerial tours of some of the most beautiful landscapes you'll ever see.  </p><p>MARCO SPAREDES (ph), FORMER BIG BEND PARK RANGER &amp; AERIAL TOUR GUIDE: I want to know in all of this, where do you put a wall?  </p><p>LAVANDERA (on camera):  Do you think if Donald Trump flew with you, he would still want to build a wall?  </p><p>SPAREDES (ph):  I want to you tell Donald Trump we already have a wall.  Thank you very much.  And I don't think he could build a bigger one.  </p><p>LAVANDERA:  This is some of the most rugged terrain you'll find along the southern border.  Hard to imagine that anyone would try to cross illegally through here.  Simply too treacherous.  </p><p>(voice-over):  The Big Bend region stretches 250 miles along the Rio Grande, a place far past the middle of nowhere.  </p><p>On a canoe trip down the Rio Grande, it's so quiet, you can hear the wind flutter past coasting birds.  </p><p>Every night, 88-year-old Pamela Taylor, out of compassion, leaves bottled water outside her home for migrants moving north and the Border Patrol agents chasing them.  </p><p>She's lived in this house in Brownsville, Texas, a stone's throw from the border, since 1946.  When the border fence was built nearly 10 years ago, north of the river, she found herself on the south side, between the wall and Mexico.  </p><p>(on camera):  You're a little bit of no-man's land here.  </p><p>PAMELA TAYLOR, LIVES AT U.S./MEXICO BORDER:  My son-in-law says we live in a gated community.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You have to laugh about it.  </p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  Taylor voted for Trump and wants to see illegal immigration controlled.  She once found an undocumented migrant hiding from Border Patrol agents in her living room.  </p><p>But she warns the rest of the country that a wall won't work.  </p><p>TAYLOR:  That wall is not going to stop them.  If it's 20 feet high, they're going to get a 21-foot ladder.   LAVANDERA:  Donald Trump wants to build a bigger, more powerful wall.  </p><p>TAYLOR:  I would like for Mr. Trump -- I will feed him if he will come down here and talk to the people.  </p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over):  Until then, life on the border will keep passing by Pamela Taylor's front porch.  And it might even stop for a quick drink.  </p><p>(on camera):  What you hear repeatedly from people along the Texas/Mexico border is that the idea of a wall plays better in Ohio and Michigan than it does in the borderland communities.  They say they've seen it up close and personal for the last 10 years and they're not that impressed.  It hasn't stopped the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs.  So, all of that continues.  </p><p>Border Patrol agents will tell you they've seen the wall be rather effective in the last 10 year.  But human rights activists say it's pushed migrants out into more dangerous and deadly areas out in the deserts in the most remote areas of the southern border -- Poppy?  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:55:26]  HARLOW:  Ed Lavandera, thank you so much.</p><p>Next hour, Ed's journey takes us to Arizona where renegade groups are taking matters into their own hands.  </p><p>Stay with us.

The new Homeland Security Department policy under Donald Trump's new executive order on a travel ban is, if you have a valid green card but if you're from one of the seven countries that the administration has deemed prone to terrorism, you will not be allowed back into the United States. The government of Iran will now ban U.S. citizens from entering its borders as a, quote, \"principle of reciprocity,\" and Iran is one of seven countries whose nationals Trump has banned from the U.S. for at least 90 days. Donald Trump's four-month ban on refugees does not include any of the countries where the 9/11 terrorists were from, most from Saudi Arabia non-included but Egypt and Lebanon are not included. There are now at least three legal challenges filed against the White House's executive order banning travel from 7 Muslim countries into the U.S. Two Democratic representatives, Congressman Jerrod Nadler, of, and Democratic Congressman Nydia Velazquez, speak about Donald Trump's Muslim ban and about Hameed Darweesh, an Iraqi national who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. Army, and was detained at JFK Airport. Vice President Mike Pence, while governor of Indiana, tweeted, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are offensive and unconstitutional,\" so is the Trump administration divided?

Listen</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HAMEED DERWEESH, IRAQI NATIONAL DETAINED: The greatest nation, the greatest people in the world. A special immigration visa on my passport with my family because I work with the U.S. government. I support the U.S. government on the other side of the world. But when I came here, they said, nope. They kick me out as if I break the rules or do something wrong. I'm surprised really.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(CROSSTALK)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: That was Hameed Derweesh, who worked as an interpreter for the U.S. government during the Iraq war.</p><p>The New York Congressman Jarrod Nadler said 11 others are detained at this hour at JFK.</p><p>This travel ban affects seven Muslim majority nations. It stops admission of all refugees to the United States temporarily for four months. Confusion and chaos rippling through law enforcement agencies, airports and international cities as people try to wrap their head around what this all means.</p><p>this comes amid a world of diplomacy for <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>He just wrapped up phone calls with five world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p><p>We have all of this covered this hour.</p><p>I want to begin with Rachel Crane, at New York's JFK Airport.</p><p>Rachel, first, let's begin with the Iraqi man who worked for the U.S. military as an interpreter, just being released after being detained for a number of hours. Do we know why he was released, on what grounds?</p><p>RACHEL CRANE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Poppy, to begin with, Darweesh was released, as you just heard. He was praising America, saying Americans were the best people in the world.</p><p>Now, it's unclear why Darweesh was held and detained here. He was traveling with three children and his wife and they were not detained. That just highlighted how random the executive order was and the application of it. His family was not detained, but only him.</p><p>Now a source close to the case indicated to CNN that there is a provision for the State and Department of Homeland Security to make exemptions for certain people.</p><p>But listen to what Darweesh had to say about the ordeal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DARWEESH: I just went through the terminal and give my passport that I gave from the U.S. embassy all the documents and say, don't open it. They give it to the officer, and then ask me to move in a different room and say -- actually, they don't say anything, but they keep me there until those people come to support me.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: You stay in the same room the whole time?</p><p>DARWEESH: Yeah, for about two days. They move me to other room but I sit on chair. I didn't sleep.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CRANE: Now, Poppy, when asked what his message to <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was, Darweesh said he liked the man but is confused about this policy.</p><p>Any minute, a press conference will be held where hopefully we'll have an update about the remaining detainees at JFK -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: I know a lawsuit has been filed by attorneys representing them, arguing basically this ban is unconstitutional, citing the establishment cause and the Fifth Amendment. What do we know about the lawsuit and where it stands?</p><p>CRANE: The lawsuit was filed today. And one of the plaintiffs is still being detained here at JFK. We know that he was granted a visa refugee status and his wife and child had been in the U.S. for about two years, also granted refugee status. That Iraqi man had gone under on the exhaustive process of applying for refugee status.</p><p>And earlier today, we got a chance to speak with Congressman Nadler and he indicated that the 11 -- I'm sorry -- 10 of the other detainees did not have legal representation -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: Rachel, thank you very much.</p><p>Other questions about what this means for people holding green cards. Some sources telling CNN that the president's executive action on immigration and refugees could affect those who already hold green cards. Also, possibly, and specifically those from the seven countries highlighted there, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen. Ryan Nobles joining us from the White House for more clarity on this.</p><p>So, what we're hearing, Ryan, is that this is a case by case basis. Right? This isn't all green card holders from the seven countries. They're going to take this one by one, is that correct?</p><p>[15:05:00] RYAN NOBLES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's the way the administration is describing it, but there's a bit of confusion.</p><p>So, let's try to hash this out the best we can. If you hold a green card, an active green card that makes you a permanent legal resident of the United States but come from one of the seven countries that the administration designated as possible hot beds of terrorism, then you must go through a process, you must submit a waiver before you can return to the United States. Essentially, if you go to the airport and try to buy a plane ticket, you'll be denied at that point, and have to go through a process, and no telling how long or short that process will be. It's not officially been revealed exactly how the Department of Homeland Security will handle these waivers.</p><p>And it's also important to point out, Poppy, if you are a green card holder, you've already gone through a lengthy vetting process by the United States government that allowed you to obtain that important document. It's unclear right now exactly what the next steps will be for these green card holders. At the very least, this could impact tens of thousands of people who, for the most part, are American residents, even though not necessarily citizens from the United States. And there are administration sources telling CNN, who happen to be a co-holder from one of the countries that are impacted, their advice to you in terms of travel is to stay here in the United States -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: We know that tech companies, a number of big tech companies, including Google, have told their employees in the last 24 hours, do not travel out of the United States if there is any chance that this could affect you. So, there's a lot of questions, certainly, through corporate America right now as well.</p><p>Ryan Nobles, at the White House, thank you for that.</p><p>When you look at the specific travel bans, in Iran, the response is, they are slapping their own ban on the United States, saying, no U.S. citizens allowed to enter Iran, they say, for as long as <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>order is in effect.</p><p>Our Ben Wedeman joining me now from Istanbul, Turkey.</p><p>Ben, a lot to get to here. I thought it was interesting that Iran and its response said that this will only embolden extremists and their supporters.</p><p>BED WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that came in a foreign ministry statement out of Tehran. They said, among other things, that this is an obvious insult to the Islamic world and in particular, the great nation of Iran. That according to the statement from the foreign ministry. And it's not just Iran that is considering these measures. We've heard members of the Iraqi parliament suggesting that Iraq take the same sort of measures. And that's particularly problematic when you consider that there are more than 5,000 U.S. military personnel in Iraq supporting that country's effort to destroy ISIS.</p><p>So, when you speak to a variety of people, I've been in touch, for instance, with a former member of U.S. Special Forces who served in Afghanistan and Iraq. He says when this sort of message goes out, it puts the lives of U.S. military personnel in danger -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: I think it's very important to note for viewers, of the seven countries -- and let's hold them back on the screen -- and what this ban extends to, this four-month ban on any refugees, this does not include any of the countries where the 9/11 terrorists were from, most from Saudi Arabia non-included. Egypt is non-included. And Lebanon is not included.</p><p>WEDEMAN: It's important to keep in mind, particularly when you consider the man who participated in the San Bernardino attack, who left 14 U.S. citizens dead, he originally came from Pakistan. His wife was Pakistani, entered the country not as a refugee but on the fiance visa program.</p><p>But yes, look at Saudi Arabia. 16 of the 19 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia. Ad most who know the Middle East will tell you that the ideology that inspires al Qaeda and ISIS originates in Saudi Arabia. But reasons that have not become clear, Saudi Arabia, nor Pakistan is on this list of seven predominantly Muslim nations listed in the executive order -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: You're in Istanbul, Turkey. And for the better part of two years, Istanbul, Turkey, in general, has become increasingly unstable. President Erdogan is fighting back against the coup attempt. What are people saying today in Istanbul about concerns that perhaps Turkey may be at it?</p><p>[15:10:11] WEDEMAN: Nobody is particularly concerned that Turkey will be added. Let's not forget that Turkey is a member of the NATO alliance, that there is a U.S. military basis.</p><p>But people, on a gut level, look at this ban and, even though it's seven countries, more than one million pop and most Muslim affected by the ban so we are offended. And the Turkish prime minister and the British prime minister asked pointed questions from reporters about this ban, and both Theresa May and the Turkish prime minister avoided the questions because, obviously, relations with the United States at the minute are sensitive so they try to stay away from it. But at street level, widespread revulsion at this decision by the United States -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: And I should know, Ben, but as someone who has covered all of the years, your take on what <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>said when asked by a reporter about whether Christians would be given priority in terms of refugees trying to come into this country? WEDEMAN: Certainly, Christians have been victims of ISIS, victims of oppression, victims of a rising sentiment of Islamic fundamentalism that they pay a price for. But if you look at the actual numbers, the number of Christians admitted to the United States as refugees is more or less reflective of their proportion of the population. It is not true that it is impossible for Christians to enter the country, the United States, as refugees. It's just as difficult for them as it is for Muslims as well to get in. And when the president differentiates between Muslims and Christians, this causes a certain amount of resentment among the Muslim majorities. It's another problematic issue where a very simplistic solution is being applied to a very complicated problem -- Poppy?</p><p>HARLOW: Ben Wedeman live for us in Istanbul. Ben, thank you so much for the report.</p><p>We have a lot ahead this hour. Much more on our breaking news. You'll hear from a refugee family who just arrived in the United States. Now they fear they'll have to return to war-torn Syria.</p><p>And later, Ed Lavandera brings us an extraordinary in-depth series about the wall.</p><p>Hi, Ed.</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Poppy, we're taking a nearly two- dozen-mile journey along the southern border with Mexico, from Brownsville, Texas to San Diego, California. Join us as we capture the snapshots and the voices of the people who called the borderland home.</p><p>HARLOW: It is an incredible series. You'll see all right here over the next three hours.</p><p>Stay with us. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>[15:16:49] HARLOW: Right now, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>travel ban for 7 Muslim majority nations is sending shock waves across airports and international cities. A few hours ago, an Iraqi man who worked for the U.S. government, the military, specifically, for a decade was detained at New York's JFK Airport. He was recently released. New York Congressman Jerrod Nadler said 11 others are still being held there.</p><p>And a lawsuit has been filed challenging the president's ban which holds immigration from the seven Muslim-majority nations -- you see them on the screen -- and completely halts the refugee program.</p><p>Let's talk it out with our panel, Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court reporter; Josh Rogin, of \"The Washington Post,\" the columnist there; Betsy Woodruff, politics reporter for \"The Daily Beast\"; and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist, Alice Stewart, formerly Ted Cruz's communications director.</p><p>Great to be with you.</p><p>(CROSSTAKL)</p><p>Ariane, if you could begin, and go through this lawsuit. This is the first real legal challenge that the president on his executive order. Explain what's the argument is here. Are they saying it's unconstitutional because of the establishment clause, the Fifth Amendment? What's the argument?</p><p>ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN SUPREME COURT REOPRTER: There are several due process claims. But one of the big claims is discrimination based on religion. And what the president could come back and say here is, look, when it comes to immigration, I have broad authority. But other people might come back and say, look, in this case, you've gone too far.</p><p>But what is most interesting about this lawsuit is it provides this road map for one man's journey, his legal journey. Hameed Darweesh, several years ago, worked as a contractor the U.S. government. He began to feel retaliation and wanted to apply for one of these visas. He went through a three-year process to do it, and that included meeting with somebody at the mission. He gets the visa. He gets on an airplane and lands last night, and when he gets there, he's told, look, you can't come in. His lawyers were waiting. They went to customs and said, why aren't you letting him in? And the response was talk to Mr. Trump. So, this is the start of many lawsuits we might see coming down the road. He's now been released but there are others in the pipeline.</p><p>HARLOW: Alice, to you, and something our Ben Wedeman was just talking about, the fact that, you know, none of the 9/11 hijackers, from the UAE, Egypt, Lebanon, and most from Saudi Arabia, are not included on this travel ban. None of the countries are included. And when you look at the most recent attacks in France, for example, \"Charlie Hebdo,\" you had three French nationals of Algeria descent, and Paris attacks over a year ago, mainly French and Belgian nationals of Moroccan descent. None of those countries are part of this travel ban. Why is that?</p><p>ALICE STEWART, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I certainly trust our national security officials that did picked the seven nations that are affected here, specifically, Syria and Iraq, which are ISIS strongholds, and that is the reason they picked these nations. And the vetting process clearly didn't meet the standards necessary to execute this.</p><p>I think it's important to go back to the origin of the executive order. It is to protect all Americans from foreign nationals who intend to come to this country to carry out terrorist acts. And, look, our country, our national security agencies must be right 100 percent of the time. Terrorists only need to be correct one time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[15:20:31] STEWART: I think this is an important step, but it's necessary to be done. And, look, there's going to be hiccups with any kind of major rollout like this. I remind you, healthcare.gov, Obama administration had months and millions of dollars to execute that and they failed.</p><p>I think what we're seeing now is unfortunate, and clearly frustrating for those who are detained at the airport. But I do understand the proper procedures are in place to smooth things out in order to execute this executive order in a more smooth way.</p><p>HARLOW: But, Alice, I want to pull up these two pictures. You can look. These are two little boys, two victims of the civil war in Syria, as you know. This boy washed up dead on the beach after his family tried to flee. This boy's family's home bombed in Aleppo. He survived. Some of his family members died. These are also people who will not be allowed refuge in the United States.</p><p>And this executive order does not create a safe zone within Syria for them to go, something that <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>said when he was campaigning and then it's not there. It affects these people as well.</p><p>STEWART: And those images are chilling and heartbreaking, and no one can look at those pictures and not be devastated by them. But, look, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>made it clear while he was campaigning, and since he's been president, that his number-one priority is the safety and security for Americans. And this executive order is to do just that, to protect Americans here in our country from those who intend to come here and do harm.</p><p>HARLOW: However, Alice, he could have written in there a clause allowing, say, mothers and their children to come, and their infants to come. Would you have liked to see that?</p><p>STEWART: Look, look at what we have in San Bernardino. This is one of the key people involved in that that was a female --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JOSH ROGIN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: From Pakistan.</p><p>HARLOW: Yeah.</p><p>STEWART: -- every single rule. And it's important to put down a firm line. This was certainly a bold move and there's going to be changes to it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: Except, Alice --</p><p>STEWART: So it's important to take a bold step.</p><p>HARLOW: Except, Alice, that's just not factual. The male attacker in San Bernardino was born in Illinois to Pakistani parents, and Tashfeen Malik was born in Pakistan, moved to Saudi Arabia, and came to the U.S. So, that's not a comparison. That's not factual to say, look at what happened in San Bernardino. STEWART: My point is that, certainly our hearts go out to everyone that's a Syrian refugee and needs to come here, but we can't just look at women and children as across-the-board innocent in this. because some have played a role, specifically women, in some of these acts. So, I think it's important to have a firm line in the sand and that's exactly what's happening here.</p><p>HARLOW: We're going to take a quick break. We'll be back with my panel in just a moment.</p><p>[15:27:10] HARLOW: All right. My panel is back with me as we continue to discuss the breaking news.</p><p>We're also waiting for a statement from some lawmakers at JFK Airport.</p><p>Josh Rogin, let's go to the point about the fact that not contained in this executive order are safe zones in Syria. Do we know why? The president talked about this campaigning.</p><p>ROGIN: It was one of his campaign promises. We're told there were objections from national security officials within the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>because of the requirements and sources it would take from the U.S. military in order to implement the safe zones. I think they're still working on it. Let's see what happens down the road.</p><p>But I also want to address the point about which countries were and were not included in the list. Let's remember that the total number of terrorist attacks carried out in America from these countries is zero. Zero. In addition to the ones you mentioned, there was the Christmas Day bomber from Nigeria, the Orlando bomber from Afghani descent, and the San Bernardino bomber who was Pakistan, and the Times Square from Pakistan. The arbitrary nature of choosing these countries is a huge problem.</p><p>And I recall Theresa May speaking to the Republican conference in Philadelphia, and what she said was not only combat terrorism militarily but the ideology of terrorism, and the way to do that is by not giving in to the narrative that U.S. isn't at war with a religion, and that was a viewed shared by George W. Bush. That's been eroded today.</p><p>HARLOW: Guys, stand by, if you would.</p><p>I want to go to JFK Airport in New York. Democratic Congressman Jerrod Nadler, speaking, and Democratic Congressman <person><nameText>Nydia Velazquez. </nameText></person>Let's listen.</p><p>REP. JERROD NADLER (D), NEW YORK: I want to make two major point. First, the executive order signed by <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is discriminatory, on religion, and, frankly, quite disgusting. It is also counterproductive. The expressed intent to protect the United States against terrorists.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is not a single terrorist incident since before 9/11 has been caused by anyone from the seven countries that the president named. By contrast, a country like Saudi Arabia, which produced most of the attackers on September 11th, is not covered by this order.</p><p>Secondly, the refugees who have valid visas, the president said he wants extreme vetting. We've been doing extreme vetting for years. For years, we've been doing vetting. All of these refugees have been and the records looked into for an average of two years, two years, by American authorities.</p><p>[15:30:00] The person who was held and released this morning, finally, released this morning, Hameed Darweesh, who was detained overnight was a marked man in Iraq because he served as interpreter and worked with American troops. He helped the U.S. Army for years. He's not a potential terrorist.</p><p>So, it's counterproductive, ridiculous, and discriminates on the basis of religion. Christians from these countries are allowed in. Only Muslims are not. And that goes against our tradition, from George Washington onward, and it doesn't help protect the United States.</p><p>The second point is that the application of this, in dealing with the people we have here today, is particularly ridiculous. Even if you said that you wanted to keep people from certain countries out of the United States, once you have vetted certain people, once the American staff people, the State Department people, the military people have looked at a given individual and said, this person is no threat, they've looked at him for two years and given him a valid visa and then, while in the air, this executive order comes out. He should be permitted to enter the country. People would not be permitted to get on a plane, but people in the air should not be taken to custody in this country. That makes no sense at all. Because, after all, the timing of the order with the one day earlier, one day later, is entirely based on happenstance. And people have been coming into this country from these countries, and one more day for people who got valid visas would make no difference at all.</p><p>So, a wooden application makes no sense and an unconstitutional and disgusting application on the basis of religious discrimination violates every tradition of this country and we're here to say they should stop and should be revoked.</p><p>Nydia.</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>NYDIA VELAZQUEZ </nameText></person>(D), NEW YORK: Thank you.</p><p>I'm Congresswoman <person><nameText>Nydia Velazquez, </nameText></person>and I represent the 7th congressional district, that has a lot of working families, a lot of immigrant families.</p><p>Mr. President, look at us. This is America. What you have done is shameful. It's un-American. And it's created so much confusion, not only among working families and families in America, but also, it's creating confusion with the people that are working in homeland security. This executive order is arbitrary. It doesn't provide real guidelines. And it's unjust. Here we have refugees who were granted legal visas to enter this country and yet, they have been detained illegally. That is the argument that Jerrod and I and the refugees project is making. I am begging you to go and reverse it. It is ill advised. It's mean spirited. It's tearing families apart. And that is not who we are. It will undermine the cooperation and collaboration that we need from Muslim countries to fight terrorism. It is wrong. And we will fight it today and every single day.</p><p>HARLOW: You heard from two Democratic representatives at JFK Airport.</p><p>Let me go back to my panel.</p><p>Betsy, I'd like your reaction to this. Back in 2015, now Vice President Pence, then the governor of Indiana, tweeted this, \"Calls to ban Muslims from entering the United States are offensive and unconstitutional.\" He also tweeted, \"Our Constitution guarantees the free exercise of religion, the U.S. cannot discriminate on the basis of religion.\"</p><p>Does this put the administration on a complicated and not united front on this?</p><p>BETSY WOODRUFF, POLITICS REPORTER, THE DAILY BEAST: Without a doubt. Pence and his allies, including congressional Republicans, argue this executive order isn't technically a Muslim ban. They point out that many other majority countries, like Indonesia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia --</p><p>ROGIN: Turkey.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>WOODRUFF: -- are not included. They argue that that means everything works together. Of course, we can expect critics to bring up this tweet and this sentiment that Pence shares to make the case that, look, if you're banning people from the majority Muslim countries but carve out refugees who aren't Muslim, that in practice is what a Muslim ban looks like. And Pence made such a strong statement that sounded very principled so recently, without a doubt, it undermines the administration's rhetoric on this. A lot of tweets will come back to haunt Vice President Pence.</p><p>[15:35:27] HARLOW: Alice, final word to you. For those who call this basically a ban on Muslims or a religious test that's cloaked as something else, you say?</p><p>STEWART: That's absolutely not factually correct. This is not about religion. There's no religious test to get into this country as a result of this executive order. And that's completely missing the point. It gives the lawyers an argument to -- a legal leg to stand on, but that does not, any aspect of this executive order.</p><p>And I go back once again to the primary focus of this executive action is to protect all American from terrorists that try to come in this country and do us harm. That's the goal, the focus, and that is the underlying message of what this is about. And the countries picked - yes, Joshua is correct -- none of the terrorist acts -- people who came in to carried out terrorist acts have come from these countries, but I trust our national security experts as to why they picked these seven countries, based on where ISIS currently is. And we also have to remember ISIS has grown significantly due to the fact that the Obama administration failed to stand firm on the red line in Syria, and that's caused the growth of ISIS. So, I think the Democrats have to take some of the blame for the growth of this problem in the first place.</p><p>HARLOW: Thank you all. We appreciate it, Ariane, Alice, Betsy and Josh.</p><p>Still to come, the major of New Orleans will join me live. He says the police in New Orleans will not be part of the president's, quote, \"deportation force.\" We're talking about sanctuary cities. Mayor Mitch Landrieu joins me next.</p><p>You're Live in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>[15:40:15] HARLOW: Welcome back. You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Poppy Harlow.</p><p>As we continue to follow the breaking news, let's get to another executive order signed on Wednesday. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>signed an order to withhold federal funding from so-called sanctuary cities.</p><p>New Orleans is such a city, but it's mayor, Mitch Landrieu, said that the city complies with all federal lay and is not in danger of losing any money.</p><p>And just to give you a sense of what this means, this is a city where the local law enforcement doesn't necessarily report or turn over undocumented people in this city to ICE or immigration officials.</p><p>In a strongly worded statement, the mayor said, \"The NOPD will not meet the deportation force and live from New Orleans.\"</p><p>Mayor Landrieu joins us now.</p><p>Good to have you on.</p><p>MITCH LANDREIU, (D), NEW ORLEANS LAW: Poppy, thanks for having me.</p><p>HARLOW: As you know, this could cost the city of New Orleans heavily when it comes to federal funding. Being told, you said we're not going to comply with this. You believe you're in line with the law. Why do you think this isn't going to cost the city any federal funds?</p><p>LANDRIEU: Let me make a couple of general comments about the executive orders the president signed in the last couple of days.</p><p>First of all, mayors across America understand the first priority is to keep America safe. From looking at the occurrences recently in Boston, New York, San Bernardino, it's actually local law enforcement that are the tip of the spear in the fight against terrorism to protect national security and public safety. We understand our jobs. And the mayors and police chiefs of America along with the U.S. Conference of Bishops looked at both of these executive orders and concluded that they are un-American and, in some instances, arguably, unchristian. And are not going to keep us safe.</p><p>We need communion with the people who we're responsible to take care of, and if you turn local police departments to the de facto ICE agents for the United States of America, we'll push people back in the shadows and not have the cooperation we need and not able to keep the streets of America safe. The mayors presented a plan to the president of the United States about how to keep the streets of America safe and we look forward to talking with them how to do it.</p><p>The city of New Orleans right now is in compliance with all federal laws and regulations. If we take somebody off the street with respect to committing a violent crime and going to jail and get deported, that's really not the issue on the table. The issue on the table is whether or not our police departments are asked to be part of the ICE deportation force to separate families. And I think most of us understand and the police chiefs in America know that's not going to make America safer but hurt us.</p><p>HARLOW: Have you gotten any response from the president or anyone at the White House to basically your defiance of this executive order?</p><p>LANDRIEU: Well, first of all, the executive order is unconstitutional for a number of different reasons. Number one, there is no definition in federal law what a sanctuary city is. That's going to surprise Americans, but there's no definition in the law of what it is.</p><p>And secondly, the federal law is fairly clear, based on the interpretations of the Supreme Court, that you cannot compel cities do things under threats of losing funds.</p><p>Thirdly, this doesn't seem to make sure. We want to help you make the city safer, Mayors, but the one way to punish you is to take funds away from Homeland Security and the police department that are charged with making the city safe.</p><p>(CROSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: As you know, Mayor, it's a way to compel you.</p><p>LANDRIEU: I understand that -- I understand that, but you don't throw the baby out with the bath water. I suggest to the president and the vice president, look at our secure America plan, which calls for the hiring of 50,000 police officers trained in community policing, supporting funding for the DEA, ATF, FBI and U.S. Marshals and U.S. attorneys, to give the attorney general direct action to take cases against individuals with gun crimes, and then invest in domestic violence and substance abuse programs as well as early childhood education. We did this some time ago in this country and we reduced crime rate by half. We can do that again with smart policies that are also tough. But we ought to maintain our values, our Judeo-Christian values and also our American values as American continues to shine the light of freedom across America and the world. HARLOW: Mayor, I understand that you believe -- and I'm sure your attorneys in the city there have checked this out -- and they maintain that the cities in compliance with federal law, as you see it. However, if the administration does follow through and does pull federal funding from the city of New Orleans, which, as you noted, helps support your police department, helps support you in the case of a natural disaster, will you stand your ground? Will you maintain the city's status as a sanctuary city?</p><p>LANDRIEU: First of all, again, as I said, there is no definition of a sanctuary city. And second of all --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARLOW: Will you maintain your practice?</p><p>[15:45:12] LANDRIEU: Let me -- let me finish, if I might.</p><p>We are practicing the law that has been directed to us by a federal judge. We cannot be out of compliance with federal legal law because we're following a federal court order. The president's executive order doesn't trump a federal judge's order, not in anybody's imagination. We're feel like we're in compliance and we're going to continue to be.</p><p>And I want to stress this to the people of America. The mayors of America are interested in making sure that violent criminals, irrespective of the immigration status, are taken off the streets of the city. And we do cooperate with them on those matters and will continue to do so.</p><p>It's when you get into trying to separate families and destroy neighborhoods and hurt the economy and, basically, make the cities more insecure than they already are, that we'll say, listen, we've got to find a better way to do this. Work with us. We want to work with you.</p><p># Mayor Mitch Landrieu, I appreciate it. I'll be in your beautiful city in just about two weeks. Thank you very much.</p><p>LANDRIEU: Oh, that's great. Hope you have a great time.</p><p>HARLOW: See you there. Thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: Straight ahead for us, it's an issue at the center of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>agenda, what people living along the border between the United States and Mexico are saying about his plans for a wall. A special three-part series begins next.</p><p>You're live in the CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>[14:50:05] HARLOW: Our CNN national correspondent, Ed Lavandera, has spent the last two months traveling the length of the United States border with Mexico. And as President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>rounds out his first week in office, border issues, not surprisingly, are at the center of his agenda.</p><p>Over the next three hours, you'll see an extraordinary in-depth series, one that captures snapshots of life and the voices of the people who call the borderlands home.</p><p>Part one takes us to Texas. That state spans 1,250 miles of border with Mexico, more than any state. And for Texans the issue of immigration is far from simple.</p><p>Here's our Ed Lavandera.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This journey across the U.S./Mexico border begins in south Texas where the Rio Grande empties into the Gulf of Mexico. And on a rugged ride in an all-terrain vehicle with Robert Cameron, who runs an ATV border tour business, in the small town of Progresso.</p><p>(voice-over): Do you think people have that impression of the border? A scary, dangerous place.</p><p>ROGERT CAMERON, MANAGER, ATV BORDER TOUR BUSINESS: Oh. Scary, dangerous place, absolutely. Not as bad as people make it seem to be.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): Cameron was born in Mexico. Is now a U.S. citizen. Was a long-time Democrat until <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>came along, and made him a Republican.</p><p>Living and working on the border reveals a blurry reality. Cameron fully supports the idea of Trump's border wall. But every day, he sees the holes in that plan.</p><p>(on camera): This is part of the border wall that already exists, right?</p><p>CAMERON: Exactly. Exactly. This is put back in 2006 by George Bush. It's been around for a while.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): A few months ago, while riding along the Rio Grande, he recorded this video of what appeared to be smugglers with packs. It's the kind of story countless people along the border can share.</p><p>But this is an area where a border fence is already in place. Yet drugs and human smuggling keep coming.</p><p>CAMERON: It hasn't stopped them. No, absolutely not.</p><p>You got this wall all the way around that the eye can see all the way over there.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): It keeps going.</p><p>CAMERON: It keeps going. And then it's like -- they start here. I don't know. I'm sure there's a reason. Wouldn't you think? They ran out of money?</p><p>LAVANDERA: This is the landscape in the Big Bend area of Texas. That's the challenge, how in the world do you build a wall in this kind of terrain?</p><p>(voice-over): Marco Sparedes (ph) lives in Terlingua (ph), a far- flung outpost in the Big Bend region of west Texas. He's a former Big Bend Park ranger who now takes visitors on aerial tours of some of the most beautiful landscapes you'll ever see.</p><p>MARCO SPAREDES (ph), FORMER BIG BEND PARK RANGER &amp; AERIAL TOUR GUIDE: I want to know in all of this, where do you put a wall?</p><p>LAVANDERA (on camera): Do you think if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>flew with you, he would still want to build a wall?</p><p>SPAREDES (ph): I want to you tell <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>we already have a wall. Thank you very much. And I don't think he could build a bigger one.</p><p>LAVANDERA: This is some of the most rugged terrain you'll find along the southern border. Hard to imagine that anyone would try to cross illegally through here. Simply too treacherous.</p><p>(voice-over): The Big Bend region stretches 250 miles along the Rio Grande, a place far past the middle of nowhere.</p><p>On a canoe trip down the Rio Grande, it's so quiet, you can hear the wind flutter past coasting birds.</p><p>Every night, 88-year-old Pamela Taylor, out of compassion, leaves bottled water outside her home for migrants moving north and the Border Patrol agents chasing them.</p><p>She's lived in this house in Brownsville, Texas, a stone's throw from the border, since 1946. When the border fence was built nearly 10 years ago, north of the river, she found herself on the south side, between the wall and Mexico.</p><p>(on camera): You're a little bit of no-man's land here.</p><p>PAMELA TAYLOR, LIVES AT U.S./MEXICO BORDER: My son-in-law says we live in a gated community.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>You have to laugh about it.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): Taylor voted for Trump and wants to see illegal immigration controlled. She once found an undocumented migrant hiding from Border Patrol agents in her living room.</p><p>But she warns the rest of the country that a wall won't work.</p><p>TAYLOR: That wall is not going to stop them. If it's 20 feet high, they're going to get a 21-foot ladder. LAVANDERA: <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>wants to build a bigger, more powerful wall.</p><p>TAYLOR: I would like for Mr. Trump -- I will feed him if he will come down here and talk to the people.</p><p>LAVANDERA (voice-over): Until then, life on the border will keep passing by Pamela Taylor's front porch. And it might even stop for a quick drink.</p><p>(on camera): What you hear repeatedly from people along the Texas/Mexico border is that the idea of a wall plays better in Ohio and Michigan than it does in the borderland communities. They say they've seen it up close and personal for the last 10 years and they're not that impressed. It hasn't stopped the flow of illegal immigration and illegal drugs. So, all of that continues.</p><p>Border Patrol agents will tell you they've seen the wall be rather effective in the last 10 year. But human rights activists say it's pushed migrants out into more dangerous and deadly areas out in the deserts in the most remote areas of the southern border -- Poppy?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:55:26] HARLOW: Ed Lavandera, thank you so much.</p><p>Next hour, Ed's journey takes us to Arizona where renegade groups are taking matters into their own hands.</p><p>Stay with us.

It bars entry into the United States for people from seven Muslim-majority countries. Those are Iran, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Sudan, Yemen and Somalia. At this hour, some are being detained. Lawsuits have been filed.</p><p>And a short time ago, we heard from an Iraqi man who had been just released after being held at New York's JFK Airport.

[PARK SANG-MOON]...</p><p>Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo speaks on government efforts to control the economic crisis stemming from the coronavirus pandemic during the Korea Economic Forum at the Millennium Seoul Hilton Hotel in Seoul Wednesday. [PARK SANG-MOON]      Financial Services Commission Chairman Eun Sung-soo said the finance industry will play a significant role in the Green New Deal, details of which will be announced by President Moon Jae-in on Monday.      \u201cOne of the plan is for banks to issue green bonds,\u201d Eun said on Wednesday at the Korea Economic Forum hosted by the Korea JoongAng Daily at the Millennium Seoul Hilton in Seoul.       The Korea Economic Forum is an annual event that provides insights into government policies and the direction of Korea's financial markets and the overall economy.       This year's forum, the 14th since its start in 2007, was on the future of Korea\u2019s financial industry in the post-Covid-19 era.       This year's forum included CEOs of the four leading Korean banks \u2014 Jin Ok-dong of Shinhan; Hur Yin of KB Kookmin; Ji Sung-kyu of Hana and Kwon Kwang-seok of Woori \u2014 as well as Toss CEO Lee Seung-gun, K bank CEO Lee Mun-whan, Amcham chairman James Kim as well as delegates from 30 foreign embassies including India's ambassador Sripriya Ranganathan and Thailand's envoy Rommanee Kananurak.     Eun's comment on the Green New Deal was in response to a question by the European Union ambassador to Korea, Michael Reiterer, on green investment.       The FSC chairman said there will be several projects in the Green New Deal led by other government departments, including the Land Ministry and the Environment Ministry.       \u201cSome of these projects will be funded by the government,\u201d Eun said. \u201cBut others will be financed by [private] financial institutions.\u201d       Noting that the Korean New Deal announced by the Moon administration is composed of three parts \u2014 digital infrastructure development projects, green industry growth and supporting employment \u2014 Eun said the emphasis so far has been on digital.       \u201c[But] the government also understands the importance of the Green New Deal,\u201d Eun said.        On Wednesday, the Blue House announced that Moon will be personally announcing details of the Korean New Deal July 13.       During the forum, the FSC chairman also noted the inevitability of changes that will be forced on the financial industry by the coronavirus pandemic.       \u201c[Contactless, or 'untact,' innovation] is an unavoidable trend,\u201d Eun said. \u201cPeople no longer go to [offline] branches. They use mobile platforms at home [to conduct their financial affairs].     \u201c[And] the pandemic will accelerate cooperation [between existing financial institutions and ICT companies] in creating new and innovative untact businesses.\u201d       Eun noted that big tech companies like Naver and Apple are growing fast, and showing strong interest in expanding into financial services.       He said the biggest challenge is how to create cooperation between two different types of business \u2014 the existing finance industry and ICT \u2014 while minimizing any negative impacts.       He also mentioned the challenge of regulation of new businesses that will result from the convergences.       Another challenge is the protection of customer information at a time of rapid innovation.       \u201cOn one hand we\u2019re trying to raise innovations in financial services, which I mentioned in terms of the regulatory sandbox, which contributes to creating new and creative businesses,\u201d Eun said. \u201cBut on the other hand, [the question is] how to protect private information?\"        The FSC chairman also said there was a need to divert liquidity from the government's aggressive fiscal and monetary policies to combat the coronavirus crisis into innovative sectors rather than allowing it to merely raise asset values in real estate speculation.       \u201cWe will try to turn the flow of funds into more productive sectors through venture capital investment,\u201d Eun said.    \u201cThe financial authority will work closely with other ministries in nurturing and supporting innovative companies through government support programs,\u201d Eun said. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal and plan.\u201d             Vice Minister of Health Kim Gang-lip outlines details of the government's effort in containing the spread of the coronavirus. Korea is considered one of the countries that relatively succeeded in curving the spike of the virus infection. [PARK SANG-MOON]      This year, the Korea Economic Forum held a second session in which Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip outlined Korea\u2019s strategy for containing the spread of the coronavirus, including its successful mass-testing and contact tracing.       The Vice Health Minister said one of the important factors in the government effort was transparency.       Kim said with information traveling fast in Korea, it was important to give information that was accurate and transparent.

The Wall Street giant didn't really say anything new, but its conclusions reinforced the notion that the oil era is winding down and that renewable energy would soak up the bulk of the entire energy industry's investment dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, the report, \"Carbonomics: The green engine of economic recovery,\" said that renewable power will emerge as the No. 1 area of energy spending in 2021, usurping oil and gas spending for the first time.</p><h>Texte/Text</h><p>It also said that the green transition will drive US$1-trillion to US$2-trillion per year - per year! - in infrastructure investments, while generating as many as 20 million new jobs worldwide.</p><p>All encouraging news, if true, and even better news for the planet.</p><p>The United Nations has predicted all sorts of life-threatening calamities if carbon emissions push average global temperatures beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>When I read the Goldman Sachs report, and similar ones in recent weeks, my first thought was that we are on the verge of an investment bonanza that might make the spectacular returns seen by Big Tech (Facebook, Amazon, Tesla and others) in recent years look like a minor upward deviation in the wealthcreation norm.</p><p>My second thought: Here we go - Wall Street and its glorified bucket shops, as they always do, have found another class of investments to ram down our throats.</p><p>For sure we will get the good, but we will also get the bad and the ugly.</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell PLC, one of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, is a case in point. On Thursday the company's London-listed shares hit a 25-year low. They fell again Friday, for a one-year plunge of 60 per cent.</p><p>Yes, oil companies are dying beasts, according to believers in the green revolution, but Shell recently made it clear that it had no intention of tripping headfirst into a grubby grave. It would downgrade its oil ambitions, cut costs big time, launch an ambitious decarbonization effort and dive deep into renewable and low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen. BP PLC, the former British Petroleum, did the same - it too would evolve into a groovy and politically correct \"energy\" company - yet its shares also kept sinking, hitting a 52-week low Friday.</p><p>The share plunge was investors' way of saying that the transformation of Big Oil into Big Energy is either unwarranted or will not succeed. Oil companies have made fortunes for a century by pumping hydrocarbons from the ground and may not be able to repeat that success by producing clean, or cleaner, forms of energy - wind, solar, hydro, biomass, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal and technologies yet to be invented.</p><p>The highly successful overhaul of Orsted, the Danish oil, gas and coal company that traded hydrocarbons for wind power, becoming the world's largest offshore wind developer remarkably fast, may not be easily cloned.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons to believe the green revolution is finally coming - and to believe that it may be less glorious and bankable for investors than advertised.</p><p>In green energy's favour is its relatively low cost of capital - the blended cost of the equity and debt required to build a new project. For a company to avoid a slow-motion suicide, project returns must exceed those costs.</p><p>The Goldman Sachs report noted that green infrastructure is far more capital- and job-intensive than traditional energy projects, but its cost of capital has plummeted as investors shy away from hydrocarbon plays and throw their money at projects that are morally safe and come with less-volatile longterm returns - the kind pension funds love. Goldman Sachs said the cost of capital for oil and gas projects is 10 per cent to 20 per cent; for green projects, it's only 3 per cent to 5 per cent. There is no contest - green wins. The point being, waning demand for oil might not kill the hydrocarbon industry, but rising costs of capital could.</p><p>That's the good news for green investments. The bad news is that renewable energy projects have thrived not so much because they make business and environmental sense but because governments have been sucking fortunes out of the pockets of taxpayers to subsidize them. This is generally done through generous \"feed-in\" tariffs, in which utilities pay producers of renewable energy artificially high prices - for years.</p><p>While some of these subsidies are coming down, they are still largely in place. What happens when they disappear? Governments around the world are paying horrendous costs to fight the pandemic. At some point they will be looking for savings, and the feed-in tariffs might get the chop. Were that to happen, investors' returns might take a dive.</p><p>Even Tesla, the ultimate poster company for the green economy, is in effect subsidized through government regulations. Tesla's core electric-car manufacturing doesn't make a profit; what does is the sale of environmental credits to companies, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, that can't meet the new carbon-emission rules because their fleets lack hybrid and battery-only vehicles.</p><p>Another issue is carbon pricing. If the price of carbon spewed into the atmosphere were US$50 to US$100 a ton, hydrocarbons would be effectively taxed out of existence. Goldman Sachs says the average global carbon price is only US$3 a ton, barely enough to move the needle.</p><p>Goldman Sachs and the other investment firms that are touting the green revolution are directionally right. Renewable energy momentum is building. But don't forget that Wall Street, the City of London and Bay Street exist to flog investment products to the smart and the gullible alike. In the vast, emerging green portfolio of investments, some of these products will be winners, but most won't.</p><p>RENEWABLE ENERGY WILL REACH ABOUT 25% OF GLOBAL ENERGY SUPPLY INVESTMENTS BY 2021</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GMGAM2202010032rbcoregulyenergy</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6104-GR71-F06S-30WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"978\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Emily Reichert, chief executive of the clean-tech incubator in Somerville, said the Houston space, expected to open in 2021, will be big enough to accommodate about 50 startups, compared to about 100 in Somerville. In the meantime, Greentown will host virtual events to convene the clean-energy community there. Greentown has hired two people to staff its Houston operation, bringing its full- and part-time workforce to 30, Reichert said. \"Houston doesn't really have another organization like ours,\" Reichert said. \"But it does have a hell of a lot of talent that could be working on the climate problem. It kind of makes sense for us to go to the energy capital of the world. The more we looked at it, the more logical it became.\" \u2014 JON CHESTO</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DEVELOPMENT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Infrastructure work at Innovation Center begins</p><p>Southbridge Associates has kicked off work on the public infrastructure part of the Southbridge Innovation Center, a sprawling 150-acre mixed-use project in Southbridge at the former American Optical complex. Developer Chip Norton said he expects to spend $15 million on public infrastructure over the next three years. That work includes walking trails, lights, road upgrades, and a boat launch. Town officials have said they hope to secure state and federal funds to subsidize some of the improvements. \u2014 JON CHESTO</p><p>FAST FOOD</p><p>Drive-throughs help McDonald's sales recover</p><p>McDonald's US sales recovered much of their lost ground in May after a 19 percent slump in April, evidence that consumers tired of home cooking were eager to get back into the drive-through lane. Same-store sales \u2014 a key gauge of success \u2014 fell only 5.1 percent last month from a year earlier. The decline was deeper in international markets, but also showed improvement in May. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>FINANCE</p><p>Morgan Stanley sued by former diversity head</p><p>Morgan Stanley was sued by its former head of diversity for allegedly discriminating against Black women who work at the bank. Marilyn Booker, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1994 and became its first global head of diversity, claims in her lawsuit that the \"white male-centric leadership\" refused to adopt her plan to address racial bias at the firm and instead terminated her in December. Booker, most recently a managing director at the bank, said she repeatedly voiced her concerns about \"irrefutable and appalling patterns\" in the firm's hiring, retention, and lack of advancement of Black employees. But she claims Morgan Stanley only paid \"lip service\" to the issues. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>RETAIL</p><p>Mall of America misses another payment</p><p>Minnesota's Mall of America missed another payment on a $1.4 billion mortgage, putting the borrower more than 60 days delinquent, according to people with knowledge of the financing. The mall, one of the largest shopping centers in the United States, didn't make its roughly $7 million debt payment for June, according to the people, who asked not to be named speaking about a private matter. It was the third straight month of missed payments for the property. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>CELLPHONE</p><p>FCC head says T-Mobile's long outage 'unacceptable'</p><p>The head of the US communications regulator said T-Mobile's nationwide, hourslong outage Monday was \"unacceptable\" and that the Federal Communications Commission will investigate. T-Mobile, one of the country's three largest cellphone service providers, said it had a \"voice and text wireless issue\" that began around noon EDT Monday. The company said at 1 a.m. Tuesday that all problems should be resolved. The company blamed an Internet-traffic issue that caused problems with its network for the outage. AT&amp;T and Verizon both said their networks were operating normally. But calls between their customers and T-Mobile customers could have run into trouble because of T-Mobile's issues, creating the impression of a widespread communications failure. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>TECHNOLOGY</p><p>EU launches two investigations into Apple</p><p>European Union regulators opened two investigations on Tuesday into Apple's mobile app store and payment platform over concerns its practices distort competition, opening a new front in the EU's battle against the dominance of big-tech companies. The EU's Executive Commission said it formally launched the investigations over concerns that Apple's way of doing business hurts consumers by limiting choice and innovation and keeping prices high. Apple said the complaints are \"baseless.\" \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><p>WORKPLACE</p><p>Half of biggest public pension's staff to work remotely</p><p>The head of the biggest public pension in the United States expects to keep half its employees working remotely even after the coronavirus pandemic subsides, citing a high level of productivity and an opportunity to cut costs. Marcie Frost, chief executive of the Sacramento-based California Public Employees' Retirement System, said in a podcast posted Tuesday that the agency may also change how it interacts with its 2 million members. Some customer-service functions at its regional offices could be replaced by teleconferences or Web-based applications for face-to-face meetings, she said. \u2014 BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><p>GAMBLING</p><p>Casino industry pushes cashless payments</p><p>The American casino industry wants gambling regulators to make it easier to adopt cashless payment transactions on the casino floor, citing a desire to help customers avoid handling money during the coronavirus outbreak. In a report released Tuesday, the American Gaming Association, the gambling industry's national trade group, called on regulators in states where gambling is allowed to update their rules or laws to integrate cashless options for gamblers. The push follows an 18-month study of the issue by both commercial and tribal casinos and equipment suppliers to try to pave the way for cashless transactions on a wider basis Presently, a small number of casinos use such payments, which include debit or credit cards, as well as apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal.

Emily Reichert, chief executive of the clean-tech incubator in Somerville, said the Houston space, expected to open in 2021, will be big enough to accommodate about 50 startups, compared to about 100 in Somerville.  In the meantime, Greentown will host virtual events to convene the clean-energy community there. Greentown has hired two people to staff its Houston operation, bringing its full- and part-time workforce to 30, Reichert said. \"Houston doesn't really have another organization like ours,\" Reichert said. \"But it does have a hell of a lot of talent that could be working on the climate problem. It kind of makes sense for us to go to the energy capital of the world. The more we looked at it, the more logical it became.\" - JON CHESTO</p><h>DEVELOPMENT</h><h>Infrastructure work at Innovation Center begins</h><p>Southbridge Associates has kicked off work on the public infrastructure part of the Southbridge Innovation Center, a sprawling 150-acre mixed-use project in Southbridge at the former American Optical complex. Developer Chip Norton said he expects to spend $15 million on public infrastructure over the next three years. That work includes walking trails, lights, road upgrades, and a boat launch. Town officials have said they hope to secure state and federal funds to subsidize some of the improvements. - JON CHESTO</p><h>FAST FOOD</h><h>Drive-throughs help McDonald's sales recover</h><p>McDonald's US sales recovered much of their lost ground in May after a 19 percent slump in April, evidence that consumers tired of home cooking were eager to get back into the drive-through lane. Same-store sales - a key gauge of success - fell only 5.1 percent last month from a year earlier. The decline was deeper in international markets, but also showed improvement in May. - BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><h>FINANCE</h><h>Morgan Stanley sued by former diversity head</h><p>Morgan Stanley was sued by its former head of diversity for allegedly discriminating against Black women who work at the bank. Marilyn Booker, who joined Morgan Stanley in 1994 and became its first global head of diversity, claims in her lawsuit that the \"white male-centric leadership\" refused to adopt her plan to address racial bias at the firm and instead terminated her in December. Booker, most recently a managing director at the bank, said she repeatedly voiced her concerns about \"irrefutable and appalling patterns\" in the firm's hiring, retention, and lack of advancement of Black employees. But she claims Morgan Stanley only paid \"lip service\" to the issues. - BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><h>RETAIL</h><h>Mall of America misses another payment</h><p>Minnesota's Mall of America missed another payment on a $1.4 billion mortgage, putting the borrower more than 60 days delinquent, according to people with knowledge of the financing. The mall, one of the largest shopping centers in the United States, didn't make its roughly $7 million debt payment for June, according to the people, who asked not to be named speaking about a private matter. It was the third straight month of missed payments for the property. - BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><h>CELLPHONE</h><h>FCC head says T-Mobile's long outage 'unacceptable'</h><p>The head of the US communications regulator said T-Mobile's nationwide, hourslong outage Monday was \"unacceptable\" and that the Federal Communications Commission will investigate. T-Mobile, one of the country's three largest cellphone service providers, said it had a \"voice and text wireless issue'' that began around noon EDT Monday. The company said at 1 a.m. Tuesday that all problems should be resolved. The company blamed an Internet-traffic issue that caused problems with its network for the outage. AT&amp;T and Verizon both said their networks were operating normally. But calls between their customers and T-Mobile customers could have run into trouble because of T-Mobile's issues, creating the impression of a widespread communications failure. - ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><h>TECHNOLOGY</h><h>EU launches two investigations into Apple</h><p>European Union regulators opened two investigations on Tuesday into Apple's mobile app store and payment platform over concerns its practices distort competition, opening a new front in the EU's battle against the dominance of big-tech companies. The EU's Executive Commission said it formally launched the investigations over concerns that Apple's way of doing business hurts consumers by limiting choice and innovation and keeping prices high. Apple said the complaints are \"baseless.\" - ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><h>WORKPLACE</h><h>Half of biggest public pension's staff to work remotely</h><p>The head of the biggest public pension in the United States expects to keep half its employees working remotely even after the coronavirus pandemic subsides, citing a high level of productivity and an opportunity to cut costs. Marcie Frost, chief executive of the Sacramento-based California Public Employees' Retirement System, said in a podcast posted Tuesday that the agency may also change how it interacts with its 2 million members. Some customer-service functions at its regional offices could be replaced by teleconferences or Web-based applications for face-to-face meetings, she said. - BLOOMBERG NEWS</p><h>GAMBLING</h><h>Casino industry pushes cashless payments</h><p>The American casino industry wants gambling regulators to make it easier to adopt cashless payment transactions on the casino floor, citing a desire to help customers avoid handling money during the coronavirus outbreak. In a report released Tuesday, the American Gaming Association, the gambling industry's national trade group, called on regulators in states where gambling is allowed to update their rules or laws to integrate cashless options for gamblers. The push follows an 18-month study of the issue by both commercial and tribal casinos and equipment suppliers to try to pave the way for cashless transactions on a wider basis Presently, a small number of casinos use such payments, which include debit or credit cards, as well as apps like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and PayPal. Wider acceptance of these options has long been a goal of the gambling industry. - ASSOCIATED PRESS</p><h>INDUSTRY</h><h>Manufacturing picked up slightly in May</h><p>US industrial production rose by less than forecast in May after a record slump a month earlier, indicating a gradual recovery for manufacturing as coronavirus-related shutdowns restrained demand.

After losing the top spot to Singapore in 2018, the United States dropped further down the list to 10th place from third, according to an annual ranking from the Institute for Management Development, a business school based in Lausanne, Switzerland.

His diplomatic feats have included comparing former French president <person><nameText>Fran\u00e7ois Hollande </nameText></person>to a Second World War German general administering \"punishment beatings\"; penning a limerick accusing Turkey's leader <person><nameText>Recep Tayyip Erdogan </nameText></person>of sowing his wild oats \"with the help of a goat\"; and flattening a ten-year-old Japanese schoolboy in a game of rugby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such capers made Mr Johnson the obvious choice for foreign secretary. But, even with the world to offend, he cannot resist straying beyond his brief. His latest target? Britain's business community, aghast at the government's shambolic Brexit negotiations. \"F*** business\" was his pithy aside about warnings from Airbus and BMW of the threat to jobs and investment. A theme reprised by health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who declared it \"completely inappropriate for business to be making these kinds of threats\".</p><p>All that's a bit of context, then, for The Times' CEO Summit: a head-on collision in the making between our business and political leaders. Did it turn out that way? Well, not publicly - partly because both <person><nameText>Theresa May </nameText></person>and business secretary Greg Clark did their bit to repair relations. But privately? The pair's platitudes did not go down well. And not only over Brexit, but issues spanning business rates and the apprenticeship levy. Asked if he might ask the PM a tricky question, one FTSE-100 boss merely said: \"What's the point?\"</p><p>True, she struck the right sort of tone, ingeniously finding new ways to trot out the same banalities. Business \"provides the backbone of the economy\"; it was the \"heart of how we are going to develop this country\"; \"it's right that we listen to the voice of business\". Yes, better than Boris. But anything for Airbus? No more than: \"We are preparing for all [Brexit] eventualities\".</p><p>At one point, she seemed to be reading out random bits of November's 256-page industrial strategy doorstopper: a curtain raiser for its author. Mr Clark is pro-business enough - he'd be in the wrong job if he wasn't. He was applauded, too, by Paul Drechsler, vice president of the CBI, for saying Airbus was \"entitled to be listened to with respect\" - and also urged to impress upon his cabinet colleagues \"the immense damage they are doing talking down business\".</p><p>But Mr Clark also comes over like an economics student who, unsure what to put in his dissertation, just chucks in everything he knows and hopes it makes sense. What exactly is his strategy? And where's the clarity? Ducking a key question on post-Brexit caps for foreign workers was understandable: that's an issue for the cabinet. But the best he could offer after Pets At Home boss Peter Pritchard called for a \"level playing field\" with online rivals was a meander down the complexities of international tax rules.</p><p>As one underwhelmed company boss put it: \"That's the first time I've heard Greg Clark. That's the sort of speech you give to a foreign audience.\" Duller than Boris's, too.</p><p>                     Fangs and claws                     Fangs for nothing. That was the general sentiment towards regulators and politicians over their handling of the big four tech platforms: Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google, the so-called \"Fangs\". How come they pay so little tax and escape the regulatory burdens of established rivals?</p><p>Dame Carolyn McCall, the ITV boss, is hardly alone in finding it \"quite odd\" that Facebook can pay only \u00a35.1 million UK corporation tax despite having \u00a3842 million in sales over here. Why, too, should the \"publishers\" Facebook and Google be allowed to self-regulate? \"My biggest issue is how they are going to regulate online. No one knows how they are going to do that\".</p><p>She called them \"exponential\" businesses. As Matthew Taylor, boss of the Royal Society for encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, put it: \"The data effect is reinforcing the network effect\". He said Big Tech (the fifth \"Faang\" is Apple) had \"unparalleled power in the history of capitalism\" and suggested regulators break up Amazon.</p><p>How likely is that any time soon? Not remotely, according to the mood at the summit. One fear is that regulators and politicians don't understand Big Tech, not even culture secretary Matt Hancock, who says he does. Reining them in may take a consumer backlash, with users clawing back their data. The Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal shows why.</p><p>                     Outside chance                     So, what are the odds on that third Heathrow runway? 6-4 against. Or so says that famous bookie Willie Walsh, the boss of the airport's biggest customer, British Airways-owner IAG. Despite Monday's vote, he reckons there's more chance of it not being built: costs, air quality, noise, the pain of re-routing the M25. All could kill it.</p><p>Mr Walsh is particularly exercised about the \"exorbitant\" costs, starting at \u00a314 billion before all the \"excuses for massive cost escalation\". And he has \"zero confidence in Heathrow management's ability to deliver this project while keeping airport charges flat\". That's what it claims it can do. Implausibly, too. For the passengers' sake, the Civil Aviation Authority must keep it to its word.</p><p>                     Cyber man                     Good advice to all chief execs from Ciaran Martin, boss of the National Cyber Security Centre. Who's of most interest to hackers? The systems administrator. \"Ask them one question: are you using the same account to administer the network as you are using for your normal internet-facing work? If the answer to that question is 'yes' you have the reddest of red flags and you should go into emergency mode\".

Yeah, you're right, it's quite a list.  Welcome, Gregg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  So, 2016 was a good year, not quite up to the standards of say 2015.  We had obviously big global deals, buyer in Monsanto, A.T., Time Warner, et cetera.  What do you looking at 2017? What is your crystal ball say?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Well, I think the outlook for M&amp;A in 2017 is quite strong.  A lot of the factors that existed in 2015 and '16 that drive activity continue to persist.  So you have low interest rates.  You got abundantly available capital.  You've got limited growth opportunities for corporate organically.  And you have positive equity markets.  </p><p>      So that's all still in place.  I think more importantly, some of the headwinds we saw in 2016, it's slowdown activity, are started this upside.  And I think specifically, the regulatory environment.  I think the expectation is we'll have a little bit of an easier regulatory ..  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Thanks again, Vonnie.  I appreciate it.  Sorry about that, Gregg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  And I want to talk, so we wanted to give him an opportunity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Good idea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  As you were saying, you expect easier regulatory environment in 2017.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think the expectation 2017 will be a bit of a loose for regulatory environment.  And when you combine that with what we expect to be corporate tax reform, and in particular cash repatriation.  It's actually a general sense of optimism in the business community, in particular, in corporate America that seems to be driving the desire to go out and be much more proactive on the strategic front.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  So how does repatriation?  Is that something that's talk a lot about by, a lot by the M&amp;A bankers in the M&amp;A words?  How do you think that might impact M&amp;A?  Because so many deals we've seen, you know, J&amp;J right now talking to Kellyanne, a lot of these companies with offshore cast have used that to do deals in Europe, what happens if they bring that cash back to United States?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  So there something between $1 trillion to $2 trillion of cash trapped offshore by U.S. companies, and now the expectation will be able to bring that back in a relatively low tax rate and deployed in the U.S., so under deployed in a form of capital expenditures or in the form of M&amp;A. </p><p>      You've seen companies do lots of acquisitions outside the U.S. using that cash, but there a lot more targets in the U.S. and I think companies with the ability to deploy that capital in the U.S. whether it's a trillion or $2 trillion, and the cash that continue to generate back in the U.S., you'll see a big pick up in activity domestically.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  And what are the industries that have the most offshore cash, is it tech for the most product?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  It's really the biggest the company.  So it's mostly tech in big pharma but it's Google, Apple, Microsoft, Pfizer, J&amp;J. You saw a lot of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, trying to do things to be able to access that cash offshore via M&amp;A.  If they can just bring that back and use it and deploy it via M&amp;A in the U.S. they'll be able to do that much more easily.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  So they can bring it back, they'll use it for dividens.  They'll use it for probably share the purchases, and then use for M&amp;A is the anticipation if you will.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  OK.  Will biotech and technology companies have a lot of cash as you were --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yes.  It's really the big pharma companies with the big pharma companies as they look to grow, they probably going to deploy against biotech where the real fuel and the ability to drag the top line.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Do you expect other certain trends that emerge in a given year?  You know, when -- in 2016, you look back in a couple of years, you say that was the year of X or in 2008-2009, that was a certain, you know, era.  What would you expect the trends might be in 2017?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yes.  I think the big wave in 2017 partly fueled some of these cash repatriations, is going to be a significant amount of transaction across technology, media and telecom.  You've seen the conversion happen in that sector, it was pretty remarkable.  You've seen big transaction where Comcast bought NBC, Time Warner and AT&amp;T trying to come together, even Verizon and Yahoo to an extent.  </p><p>      But the big distribution companies, looking to buy content, and the desire for this big media companies and big technology companies to get access to content and to get closer, to get some risk critical. And if you look -- you look at the Golden Globe last night, you had 17 nominations for shows or movies that was produced by Netflix or Amazon.  I mean, imagine uttering that sentence five years ago.  </p><p>      And so, these companies acknowledging media and telecom, all of these are in content, all of these are in to get closer to consumer. I think needing to do that a lot via M&amp;A.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  What's interesting is Amazon and Google, and even Apple have lots of cash.  You know, everyday they're building our money, but they haven't done a lot of big deals.  Do you expect that changes at some point?  That they acquire, you know, acquire the arrivals or acquire entertainment companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  You see, that's the great question.  I think these companies, you know, the five biggest market cap companies in the world are all with these big tech companies.  They all happen to have big cash balances, sitting offshore, able to be brought back.  And they've been really under penetrated in M&amp;A.  </p><p>      So the real question is, when they will go pursue that as their top line growth starts to slow, which started.  It's a natural time to do it.  As the industry starts to converge is a natural time to do it. And the real question that really comes down to this regulatory piece, will the regulators allows them to do that, not just from the anti- trust standpoint but over our regulation where there's the FCC or the E.C. or the DOJ, of the FTC, will allow these big companies to get bigger via M&amp;A.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Is it the Goldman expectation, your expectation that the Trump administration be more like the Bush administration when it comes to anti-trust?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  I think it will be.  You know, it's interesting a lot will remain to be seen.  I think the hope is that we'll be a little bit looser.  I'd say the Obama administration in the past year in particular, that a lot more stringent around M&amp;A.  There were $500 billion of transactions last year that fell way, largely due to anti- trust or interpretation of tax law.  But if you look at Pfizer now or Baker Hughes and Halliburton, stay up for people (ph).  </p><p>      A lot of big deals fell away and the Obama administration kind of heading into their last year, got a lot more aggressive.  I think the views that eases up to a degree and whether it returns all the way to that -- was under the Bush administration, that will get to be seen.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Did you see situations where companies considered doing a deal.  But, you know what, that will probably get a block here in this administration, let's read for that in a year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  I think people that a lot of more anxious really as we head into 2016, and you saw some of these deals fall away.  The last thing a board or a CEO wants to do is announce a big strategic transaction and how they can held up by the regulators for a long period of time.  And then, ultimately, not happen.  </p><p>      It paralyzes a company.  It's not great for the board.  It's not great for the target or the buyer.  And if somebody's transaction, we're getting stop, people really back to it in the table.  I think if they see a looser regulatory environment, that much, more likely get back to the table.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  So Trump is going to have, he is in that real situation where he's going to have the House and the Senate, you know, but his party if you will.  So as there, we're going to see big tax moves not just on repatriation but overall a big tax cut that might impact corporate taxes.  How do you think that impacts M&amp;A overall? What's that going to do to a company that's looking to do a deal?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yeah.  I'd say, corporate tax cuts should also be a fuel to M&amp;A.  I think you'll see companies that have none core assets.  It will be a lot easier to sell them if there's a reduce tax rate, and then having to have tax so we could just selling an asset.  You'll see probably more divestitures than spin offs.  I think people have been trying to do thing via tax, been off recently.  </p><p>      The one caveat to all of that is you may see a bit of a pause for awhile until it becomes clear what the tax rate is going to be.  So you're going to sell an asset and you don't know if it's going to earn after tax at 35 percent or 25 percent or 15 percent.  You probably want to wait to see what that new tax laws going to be but there's meaningful value, apparition around the actual earnings power of what you're selling.  </p><p>      So you could actually see a bit of a log until there's clarity around the tax report, and then a significant pick up and activity.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  All right.  We're going to ask more questions for you.  We throw that first back to Vonnie.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Thanks again, Vonnie.  </p><p>      So as Vonnie said, oil and gas could be busy this year.  It was pretty slow in 2015-2016, maybe because a barrel of oil went from 100 something a barrel to as low as like $25 a barrel, I'm sure that had a big impact.  What's your view or what oil and gas is going to do in 2017?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, look at where the big energy companies, the oil and gas companies in particular, spent their time in focus in the past two years.  It was really fixing their balance sheets and fixing their cost structures for dramatically reduce oil price.  I had to figure out how to survive.  </p><p>      Lots of that self help is behind him, and you've got recovering oil price and you've got this general sense of optimism in the market that is likely to have all of them a lot more proactive around strategic activities.  So I think you'll see a meaningful pick up in activity in the oil and gas piece, especially relative to what we saw in 2015 and 2016.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  What kind of impact does it have for a company when, you know, your core commodity, if the price of that is dropping so dramatically, you know, as I said, went from 100 I think in 2014 to below 30 in 2016.  I mean, that just can't help a company who is thinking of putting himself on a block or considering expending billions to buy somebody.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Well, it's fascinating.  I think the companies that are in survival mode, need to really fix that capital structure.  And most of them were built with CapEx budgets that didn't support $50 or that was more like $100 oil, so had a dramatically reshape that.  I think the biggest companies who were positioned for the sustained downturn, weren't like they go and fix something off in the bottom because they want to make sure it was going to survive.  They might rather see it go through bankruptcy and pick up the pieces.  </p><p>      I think a lot of the companies have now gotten through that, but the bottom has been hit and we start to recover and I think the biggest companies will feel a lot better about consolidating.  And I think the smaller companies will fell like they not getting to a point where they can realize the value of doing an M&amp;A transaction.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  It makes sense.  It makes sense.  </p><p>      I want to circle back on something we're talking about earlier, which is M&amp;A trust environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  And how -- there's a lot of things that would make a banker or a lawyer feel optimistic.  What are some of the things that could be a concern in the M&amp;A trust world?  Because obviously, Donald Trump has been really fixated on jobs and maybe that starts to play into and could dampen some M&amp;A this year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yeah, I think that's right.  I think a lot in the world is going to wait and see because you have a sense for how the new administration might behave in a pro business way but not exactly how they going to behave on any specific transaction or on transactions probably define.  Lots of this consolidating transactions over the past year, who have been focus within the cost, which largely means taking that jobs.  I think that's not going to be a sound bite or not going to be a narrative, this going to be particularly appealing in this administration.  </p><p>      I think the company is going to focus on doing big M&amp;A transactions in particular, and the U.S. should be focus on, you know, creating a U.S. champion, or creating a winner in the U.S., of a global industry.  And then, they go about doing an M&amp;A transaction to create and focusing on growth and not focusing on cost cutting.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Are there particular industries where jobs are more likely to be part of the equation in a big deal like industrial companies or oil and gas even?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Yeah.  I think the big consolidating transactions that have largely work have been industrial consolidation.  We've actually seen it in consumer consolidation, the ability for these companies to come together and take out cost.  Whether it's in a form of jobs, of sales people or R&amp;D, have actually quite effective in driving the bottom line.  </p><p>      Again, but not necessarily feeding into the sentiment of where the countries going right now, which is going to be by creating jobs, is how I think they need reposition themselves around trying to put companies together in accelerated top line as opposed to just take out cost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  I got it.  Thanks, Gregg, good to have you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LEMKAU</emphasis>:  Thanks, Jeff.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCCRACKEN</emphasis>:  Back to you, Vonnie.    </p><p>      END ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  </p><p>      THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

'We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.' - Epictetus 'Learn to be indifferent to what makes no difference.' - Marcus Aurelius       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Grey-Owl-Capital-Management.jpg\">https://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Grey-Owl-Capital-Management.jpg</url> Dear Client, October brought a significant increase in market volatility and a broad equity sell-off[2] to match the late-January through early-February move lower. </p><p>From the September 21 high of 2941 to the (so far) October 26 intra-day low of 2628, the S...00 fell a bit more than 10%. At this point, it is still hard to know what to make of the move. Equity valuations remain very high. This is true even when one accounts for a sustainable shift in profit margins, the asset-light mix of US companies, and market structure1 that all argue for higher-than-historical average market multiples. Valuation presents a bad setup (but, that is not new). On the other hand, like the move lower in January, signs of increasing risk aversion (e.g. significant widening of credit spreads and narrowing of market participation) that typically begin developing months before a full bear market takes root, did not precede the current move lower. A near-term rebound would not be a surprise and we have added some equity exposure near the recent lows. Yet, given valuations and recent opportunistic transactions, we still have large positions in cash and Treasuries that should mute a continuation in the sell-off.

Corporate transactions allowed us to realize meaningful gains in two equity holdings: Express Scripts and Zoe's Kitchen. We also closed an index position at a loss, added to an existing holding, and purchased two new securities. In fixed income accounts, we have made zero changes this year. The core of the fixed income portfolio remains a barbell between long-duration US Treasury bonds (stability) and floating-rate bank loans (growth). A meaningful move in the price of gold (signaling a change in inflation) and/or credit spreads (signaling a change in growth and investor risk-aversion) would provoke a shift in fixed income portfolio structure. Despite the equity market volatility, both of these series have remained relatively stable this year. Below we detail each of the transactions from the quarter.Sale - Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES)Last quarter we wrote in detail about our June 8 initial purchase of Zoe's Kitchen. On August 14, just prior to the company's second quarter earnings announcement, we added to our position. Given our conviction in the idea, we wanted to have a larger position if the 'strategic initiatives' they were pursuing developed sooner rather than later. We increased the size of the position to 5% of account value. On August 17, Zoe's announced an acquisition by privately held Cava Group, Inc. for $12.75 per share. Despite the $12.75 deal price, we were able to realize an average sale price of $13.25; our best guess as to why the stock traded at such a premium to the deal price is short covering. With an average cost basis of $9.18, our total return was approximately 44% over an average holding period of a bit more than one and a half months.Sale - Express Scripts (ESRX)As fast as the Zoe's investment developed, Express Scripts was the exact opposite. We first purchased shares in ESRX in November of 2012. We added to the position several times over the years, most recently increasing the position by about 70% following the March 8, 2018 announcement that Cigna would acquire ESRX for $92 per share in cash and stock. (The $92 per share price reflected Cigna's stock price at the time.) Our final purchase was at just over $69 per share, only slightly higher than the $66 per share basis we had established over the previous six years. We discussed the history of our ESRX position and the merits of the Cigna deal in our first quarter 2018 letter. In the end, we sold the entire position on September 5 after the stock rallied following the news that the Justice Department was close to announcing approval for the merger. Our sale price was slightly above $90 per share and within 3% of the 'deal price' based on the then per share value for Cigna. Our ultimate return was just over 34%, a terrific return on our April investment and an 'ok' result for our overall position.Sale - iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG)sold the remainder of our position in the emerging markets[4] ETF in July. Since January, emerging market equities have been in a downtrend. The downtrend began following a modest increase in credit spreads in early 2018 and a stable-to-down gold price - conditions that are hostile to emerging markets and commodities. When those signals combined with a decisive move below the 10 month moving average, we used the modest bounce in July to exit the position. Including the lot we sold in May with this lot, we lost 7% on the position.Buy - iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT)We used the sell-off in long US Treasury bonds to opportunistically add a position in our equity accounts. The ETF positions (including this one, the gold ETF, GLD, as well as IEMG and EFA2, which we owned earlier this year) complement our individual security selection and provide exposure to 'primary' asset classes3 with two goals in mind. First, they enable a more balanced portfolio of securities that historically work best in different economic and market environments. Second, when signals from credit spreads and gold place us in a specific 'quadrant' we tilt the portfolio to the prevailing conditions. The hope is that the tilting enhances returns and minimizes portfolio volatility. We have discussed this 'all weather' or 'permanent portfolio' approach in more detail in past letters, most recently in our fourth quarter 2017 letter.Buy - Jefferies Financial Group (JEF)The financial services sector has fared poorly this year. While the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates 75 basis point this year to between 2.00%-2.25%, the longer end of the yield curve has increased only modestly. This puts pressure on a commercial bank's net interest margin. Year-to-date through October 26, the financial service sector (Spider) ETF (XLF) was down over 8%. JEF is worse - down over 22% year-to-date through October 26. Yet, JEF is a holding company and the Jefferies investment bank makes up only half of the entity. Further, an investment bank with a heavy weight toward advisory services is not impacted by the yield curve in the same way as a commercial bank. While the current yield curve[5] puts commercial banks under some pressure, from an operating standpoint, Jefferies has thrived recently. Through a series of transactions that monetized several of their larger investments, JEF increased tangible book value from $20.48 at the end of 2017 to $24.41 at the end of June 2018. In August, we added to our long-term position in JEF at just under $24 per share. The management team believes very strongly their stock price is undervalued. They demonstrated this by buying back 26 million plus shares (over 7%) at an average price of $24.41 during the first nine months of the year. We have discussed this idea several times in the past in greater length, most recently in ourfirst quarter 2018 letter. JEF is now our largest individual equity position with a weight just over 10% of our typical account.Buy - Tencent Holdings Limited (TCEHY)Most readers are familiar with Facebook, Spotify, Netflix, Nintendo, and PayPal. Those are all separate, multi-billion dollar enterprises. In China, Tencent is a market leader providing all of those functions. Tencent's core network is WeChat and it has over 1 billion users. The network effect from connecting all of those users creates a significant moat. Today, Tencent earns the equivalent of about $35 dollars per user. For comparison, in the US, Netflix users pay $10.99 per month for a standard package. As China's wealth grows, we believe Tencent can increase its market penetration in communications, gaming, media, and financial transactions, which will boost the $35 dollars per user sales figure. The stock has been under pressure for a variety of reasons including the Chinese government's increased focus on regulating online gaming. Regulation in this area is a concern, but apprehension regarding regulation should be balanced with the understanding that the government benefits from the ability to collect data from a single network - there is a symbiotic (though not necessarily appropriate) relationship between the Chinese government and Chinese 'big-tech.' We purchased a small initial position in September at just under $42 per share. At that point, the stock was already down over 30% from its January high of $61 per share. We knew we were catching a falling knife so we kept the initial position small. Subsequent to the quarter end, we added to the position, lowering our basis to $38.50. ***** For sure, the Stoics (quoted at the beginning of this letter) model a useful way to live, but they are equally (perhaps even more) instructive regarding day-to-day decision-making. We have used recent individual security and overall market volatility to make opportunistic transactions in individual names. Zoe's developed about as fast as possible and Express Scripts took what seemed forever - our response, being patient when warranted, adjusting when facts changed, was all we could control. Despite the recent market volatility, nothing that has proven useful historically is signaling we should make any major portfolio modifications. This could change quickly - even in the next few weeks. Yet, despite the headlines and noise, we work hard to be 'indifferent to that which makes no difference.' Thus, our overall posture remains similar to our last few quarterly updates. We are wary of equity valuations yet do not see the historical signs of an immediate market breakdown. We continue to hold a neutral posture - neither aggressively bullish nor bearish. ***** As always, if you have any thoughts regarding the above ideas or your specific portfolio that you would like to discuss, please feel free to call us at 1-888-GREY-OWL. ***** Sincerely, Grey Owl Capital Management, LLC This article first appeared on ValueWalk Premium[6] The post Grey Owl Capital Management 3Q18 Commentary: Long Tencent[7] appeared first on ValueWalk[8].

After Wednesday's marathon appearance by Mr. Zuckerberg and three other tech titans at a House hearing on competition in the tech industry, a more fitting quote might be ''Congresswoman, I'm not sure what you would mean by 'threaten.''' </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  That was Mr. Zuckerberg's evasive answer to a question asked by Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, about whether Facebook had ever threatened to squash smaller competitors by copying their products if they wouldn't let Facebook acquire them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It was a good question with a clear-cut answer. Facebook's copy-and-crush approach has been well documented for years, and Ms. Jayapal brought even more receipts -- previously undisclosed messages in which Mr. Zuckerberg issued thinly veiled threats to Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, about what would happen to his company if he refused to sell.</p><p>  An honest Mr. Zuckerberg might have replied, ''Yes, Congresswoman, like most successful tech companies, we acquire potential competitors all the time, and copy the ones we can't buy. That's how we've avoided going extinct like MySpace or Friendster, and we're about to do it again with Instagram Reels, our new TikTok clone.'' That would have been an illuminating answer, and one that could have let lawmakers in on the kill-or-be-killed ethos of Silicon Valley. Instead, he dodged and weaved, trying to explain away the emails without admitting the obvious.</p><p>  He did the same thing when Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia, pressed him for answers about Facebook Research -- an app that was used to snoop on users' smartphone usage and give Facebook detailed data about its competitors. Mr. Zuckerberg initially said he wasn't familiar with the app, even though Apple's decision to bar it from its App Store nearly caused a meltdown at his company last year. (He later said he misspoke, and that he remembered it.)</p><p>  I don't mean to pick on Mr. Zuckerberg. Every other witness at Wednesday's hearing -- Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple -- also dodged lawmakers' most pointed questions, or professed their ignorance.</p><p>  The result was a hearing that, at times, felt less like a reckoning than an attempted gaslighting -- a group of savvy executives trying to convince lawmakers that the evidence that their yearslong antitrust investigation had dug up wasn't really evidence of anything.</p><p>  The performance wasn't particularly convincing. You don't become a tech mogul by being sloppy or forgetful, and it strains credulity to imagine that these four hypercompetitive, detail-obsessed men -- all of whom had many weeks to prepare for Wednesday's hearing -- simply didn't remember major decisions they'd made.</p><p>  At one point, Mr. Bezos was asked about a recent Wall Street Journal report that Amazon had set up a venture capital fund to invest in start-ups, only to then introduce its own versions of those start-ups' products.</p><p>  ''I don't know the specifics of that situation,'' Mr. Bezos replied.</p><p>  At another point, Mr. Pichai, asked to explain whether it was anticompetitive for Google to threaten to delist Yelp if it didn't allow the company's search engine to use its listings in its featured snippets, said he was ''happy to engage and understand the specifics'' at a later date. Yelp has complained publicly about Google's search engine for years.</p><p>  And confronted with emails acquired by House investigators in which Apple employees promised to fast-track a company through its App Store approval process -- a seeming contradiction of Mr. Cook's assertion that it treated all developers equally -- Mr. Cook responded, ''I don't know about that, sir.''</p><p>  Give the executives this: It's hard to have nuanced conversations about complex and often technical topics in front of an audience of hostile politicians, some of whom seemed more interested in generating fiery clips for their Facebook pages than investigating antitrust concerns. And the panel's format -- rapid-fire rounds of questioning conducted over video conference, with each member given only five minutes at a time to question the witnesses -- nearly guaranteed that the conversation would remain surface-level.</p><p>  In addition, many Republican members of the subcommittee seemed to have no interest in antitrust issues at all, preferring instead to ride partisan hobby horses like claims of anti-conservative bias on social media.</p><p>  But many Democratic members came armed with real, substantive questions that deserved a fuller airing. The executives' choice to sidestep these questions -- or their inability to answer before being cut off -- may signal that they still believe they can run circles around Congress without engaging in hard, detailed conversations about how they exercise their power.</p><p>  That may have been a reasonable conclusion to draw after the past several years, a period in which Silicon Valley giants added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value while Washington barely gave it a passing glance. Despite plenty of clamoring, lawmakers have failed to pass any meaningful privacy or data protection laws during President Trump's time in office, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in any tech regulation that does not involve his own Twitter account.</p><p>  But it is less clear that a say-nothing strategy will continue to work, now that lawmakers have begun doing their homework. Sure, some members of Congress may still need their iPhones explained to them, but there is real expertise on Capitol Hill that wasn't there even a year ago, and new allies who are willing to give Congress the ammunition it needs.</p><p>  When Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in 2018, tech expertise in Washington was a rare commodity. Now, antitrust experts schooled in the intricacies of tech platforms are helping Congress investigate.</p><p>  One such specialist, Lina Khan, whose analysis of Amazon's anti-competitive business practices made her a star of the ''hipster antitrust'' movement, appeared at Wednesday's hearing sitting behind Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, whom she now advises. Tech industry leaders, who once refrained from criticizing their fellow titans out of courtesy or cowardice, are now speaking up about issues like the 30 percent cut Apple takes from purchases made through its App Store. And if Mr. Trump loses his re-election bid in November, the calls from Democrats to break up or regulate big tech companies will only grow louder.</p><p>  None of this necessarily means that Congress is on the verge of reining in Silicon Valley's excesses. There are still plenty of lawmakers who would rather focus on promoting dubious claims of partisan censorship on Facebook, or complaining about fund-raising emails getting stuck in constituents' spam filters. And tech companies' generally good reputations with Americans -- not to mention their deep lobbying pockets -- may protect them in the end.</p><p>  But at certain moments on Wednesday, each of the four tech executives appeared to be taken off guard by the rigor and depth of the questions they faced. If they were expecting to teach Tech 101 to a group of clueless lawmakers, they instead found themselves in the principal's office, being confronted with evidence of the spitballs they'd thrown. And they must have realized, in those moments, that they were seeing the beginnings of accountability.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, Google's parent company, was one of four Big Tech leaders who dodged pointed questions by lawmakers.

Facebook\u2019s copy-and-crush approach has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html\">well documented</url> for years, and Ms. Jayapal brought even more receipts \u2014 previously undisclosed messages in which Mr. Zuckerberg issued thinly veiled threats to Kevin Systrom, the co-founder of Instagram, about what would happen to his company if he refused to sell.</p><p>An honest Mr. Zuckerberg might have replied, \u201cYes, Congresswoman, like most successful tech companies, we acquire potential competitors all the time, and copy the ones we can\u2019t buy.

Mr. Zuckerberg initially said he wasn\u2019t familiar with the app, even though Apple\u2019s decision to bar it from its App Store <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html\">nearly caused</url> a meltdown at his company last year. (He later said he misspoke, and that he remembered it.)</p><p>I don\u2019t mean to pick on Mr. Zuckerberg. Every other witness at Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Sundar Pichai of Google and Tim Cook of Apple \u2014 also dodged lawmakers\u2019 most pointed questions, or professed their ignorance.</p><p>The result was a hearing that, at times, felt less like a reckoning than an attempted gaslighting \u2014 a group of savvy executives trying to convince lawmakers that the evidence that their yearslong antitrust investigation had dug up wasn\u2019t really evidence of anything.</p><p>The performance wasn\u2019t particularly convincing. You don\u2019t become a tech mogul by being sloppy or forgetful, and it strains credulity to imagine that these four hypercompetitive, detail-obsessed men \u2014 all of whom had many weeks to prepare for Wednesday\u2019s hearing \u2014 simply didn\u2019t remember major decisions they\u2019d made.</p><p>At one point, Mr. Bezos was asked about a recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html\">Wall Street Journal report</url> that Amazon had set up a venture capital fund to invest in start-ups, only to then introduce its own versions of those start-ups\u2019 products.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know the specifics of that situation,\u201d Mr. Bezos replied.</p><p>At another point, Mr. Pichai, asked to explain whether it was anticompetitive for Google to threaten to delist Yelp if it didn\u2019t allow the company\u2019s search engine to use its listings in its featured snippets, said he was \u201chappy to engage and understand the specifics\u201d at a later date. Yelp has complained publicly about Google\u2019s search engine for years.</p><p>And confronted with emails acquired by House investigators in which Apple employees promised to fast-track a company through its App Store approval process \u2014 a seeming contradiction of Mr. Cook\u2019s assertion that it treated all developers equally \u2014 Mr. Cook responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, sir.\u201d</p><p>Give the executives this: It\u2019s hard to have nuanced conversations about complex and often technical topics in front of an audience of hostile politicians, some of whom seemed more interested in generating fiery clips for their Facebook pages than investigating antitrust concerns. And the panel\u2019s format \u2014 rapid-fire rounds of questioning conducted over video conference, with each member given only five minutes at a time to question the witnesses \u2014 nearly guaranteed that the conversation would remain surface-level.</p><p>In addition, many Republican members of the subcommittee seemed to have no interest in antitrust issues at all, preferring instead to ride partisan hobby horses like claims of anti-conservative bias on social media.</p><p>But many Democratic members came armed with real, substantive questions that deserved a fuller airing. The executives\u2019 choice to sidestep these questions \u2014 or their inability to answer before being cut off \u2014 may signal that they still believe they can run circles around Congress without engaging in hard, detailed conversations about how they exercise their power.</p><p>That may have been a reasonable conclusion to draw after the past several years, a period in which Silicon Valley giants added hundreds of billions of dollars in market value while Washington barely gave it a passing glance. Despite plenty of clamoring, lawmakers have failed to pass any meaningful privacy or data protection laws during President Trump\u2019s time in office, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in any tech regulation that does not involve his own Twitter account.</p><p>But it is less clear that a say-nothing strategy will continue to work, now that lawmakers have begun doing their homework. Sure, some members of Congress may still need their iPhones explained to them, but there is real expertise on Capitol Hill that wasn\u2019t there even a year ago, and new allies who are willing to give Congress the ammunition it needs.</p><p>When Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in 2018, tech expertise in Washington was a rare commodity. Now, antitrust experts schooled in the intricacies of tech platforms are helping Congress investigate.</p><p>One such specialist, Lina Khan, whose <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html\">analysis of Amazon\u2019s anti-competitive business practices</url> made her a star of the \u201chipster antitrust\u201d movement, appeared at Wednesday\u2019s hearing sitting behind Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, whom she now advises. Tech industry leaders, who once refrained from criticizing their fellow titans out of courtesy or cowardice, are now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/technology/big-tech-hearing-apple-amazon-facebook-google.html\">speaking up</url> about issues like the 30 percent cut Apple takes from purchases made through its App Store. And if Mr. Trump loses his re-election bid in November, the calls from Democrats to break up or regulate big tech companies will only grow louder.</p><p>None of this necessarily means that Congress is on the verge of reining in Silicon Valley\u2019s excesses. There are still plenty of lawmakers who would rather focus on promoting dubious claims of partisan censorship on Facebook, or complaining about fund-raising emails getting stuck in constituents\u2019 spam filters. And tech companies\u2019 generally good reputations with Americans \u2014 not to mention their deep lobbying pockets \u2014 may protect them in the end.</p><p>But at certain moments on Wednesday, each of the four tech executives appeared to be taken off guard by the rigor and depth of the questions they faced. If they were expecting to teach Tech 101 to a group of clueless lawmakers, they instead found themselves in the principal\u2019s office, being confronted with evidence of the spitballs they\u2019d thrown. And they must have realized, in those moments, that they were seeing the beginnings of accountability.</p><p>PHOTO: Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, was one of four Big Tech leaders who dodged pointed questions by lawmakers.

Sure, some members of Congress may still need their iPhones explained to them, but there is real expertise on Capitol Hill that wasn't there even a year ago, and new allies who are willing to give Congress the ammunition it needs.</p><p>When Mr. Zuckerberg appeared before Congress in 2018, tech expertise in Washington was a rare commodity. Now, antitrust experts schooled in the intricacies of tech platforms are helping Congress investigate.</p><p>One such specialist, Lina Khan, whose analysis of Amazon's anti-competitive business practices made her a star of the \"hipster antitrust\" movement, appeared at Wednesday's hearing sitting behind Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, whom she now advises. Tech industry leaders, who once refrained from criticizing their fellow titans out of courtesy or cowardice, are now speaking up about issues like the 30 percent cut Apple takes from purchases made through its App Store. And if Mr. Trump loses his re-election bid in November, the calls from Democrats to break up or regulate big tech companies will only grow louder.</p><p>None of this necessarily means that Congress is on the verge of reining in Silicon Valley's excesses. There are still plenty of lawmakers who would rather focus on promoting dubious claims of partisan censorship on Facebook, or complaining about fund-raising emails getting stuck in constituents' spam filters. And tech companies' generally good reputations with Americans - not to mention their deep lobbying pockets - may protect them in the end.</p><p>But at certain moments on Wednesday, each of the four tech executives appeared to be taken off guard by the rigor and depth of the questions they faced. If they were expecting to teach Tech 101 to a group of clueless lawmakers, they instead found themselves in the principal's office, being confronted with evidence of the spitballs they'd thrown. And they must have realized, in those moments, that they were seeing the beginnings of accountability.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007263791</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-5831-JC85-N002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
