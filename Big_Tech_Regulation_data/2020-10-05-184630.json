But is it a monopoly?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea of breaking up Facebook is gaining attention like never before - from the campaigns of presidential candidates like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to the stunning proposal from Chris Hughes, one of the social network's cofounders, to split the company apart to curb its \"monopoly\" power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But busting up the nation's tech giants would be much harder than making a campaign pledge. Corporate breakups are a huge, and rare, undertaking for the government, and a social media company like Facebook presents unique challenges that didn't exist with past antitrust successes like the dismembering of AT&amp;T in the 1980s. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are some of the obstacles standing in the way of turning this rallying cry into reality:</p><p>The social network is certainly big and powerful - with more than 2 billion users worldwide, a huge share of online advertising revenue and tentacles that include onetime rivals like WhatsApp and Instagram. </p><p>But it's debatable whether Facebook meets the legal definition of a monopoly, a company with lasting, unchecked power to raise prices or exclude competitors. The answer could depend on how antitrust enforcers define Facebook's market - a question that has become less clear as the company has expanded. </p><p>Facebook argues it has fierce competition on all sides of its business. It's a giant of digital advertising, but is second to Google in global market share and faces competition from companies like Amazon, according to research firm eMarketer. It also competes with Apple and Snapchat as a messaging platform. </p><p>\"Facebook is in an amorphous, fast-changing market,\" said Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University. That makes the monopoly question \"convoluted and hard for the government to prove\" compared with previous antitrust cases that centered on industries like oil or railroads, he said.</p><p>Facebook critics argue there's a monopoly case to be made against Facebook, because it dominates users' online attention and grabs control of their data. But Facebook is not the sole power in the social media market. And that makes it different from AT&amp;T and its Bell System, which had a nationwide stranglehold on local telephone operators, long-distance service and telephone equipment before its breakup in the 1980s. </p><p>A decade later, the Justice Department struggled to prove that another big tech company - Microsoft - held a monopoly on personal computing through its control of Windows and Internet Explorer.</p><p>\"AT&amp;T was able to so thoroughly control the sector that nothing happened that it didn't want to see happen in terms of the introduction of new services,\" said Phil Verveer, who worked on the AT&amp;T case while at the Justice Department. \"That was not the case with Microsoft, and it might not be the case with Facebook either.\"</p><p>In past marquee antitrust cases, the road map for a breakup was relatively straightforward. The Standard Oil case, decided by the Supreme Court in 1911, saw that company split up largely along geographic lines. AT&amp;T was a heavily regulated company with separate businesses for long-distance and local telephone lines, making the lines of division clear.</p><p>Facebook doesn't have such easily identifiable boundaries. Social networking works only through reaching as many people as possible and connecting them with others, making the idea of separating parts of the business much more complex.</p><p>\"In the internet age, those kinds of options just don't exist,\" said Andrew Schwartzman, an attorney with Georgetown's Institute for Public Representation.</p><p>Critics like Warren and Hughes have talked up the idea of cleaving off Instagram and WhatsApp, which Facebook acquired in 2012 and 2014, respectively. Even though they appear to consumers as distinct apps, however, they are already deeply integrated with Facebook. Instagram, for example, uses the same advertising technology as Facebook.  </p><p>What's more, CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently announced the two platforms will be enmeshed even more tightly with the core social network, an effort he said will make the services easier to use and more secure. It could also make them even harder for regulators to unwind.</p><p>\"There may well be sound business reasons to do it,\" Schwartzman said of the changes Zuckerberg announced, \"but certainly one benefit of that would be it would make it harder to break them up.\"</p><p>The Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against AT&amp;T, and its unsuccessful battle to break up Microsoft, were yearslong affairs that started under one presidential administration and ended in another. That means whoever wins the White House in 2020 could well be out of office before a potential case against Facebook is decided or settled.</p><p>The AT&amp;T case began in 1974 and ended in 1982, after which the government spent another two years implementing an agreement that split up the company into eight smaller entities. </p><p>The government spent another decade in the 1990s and early 2000s waging an antitrust war against Microsoft for anti-competitive behavior, arguing that its operating system and internet browser should be separated. But by the time the court approved a settlement in 2002, requiring changes to the company's business practices but leaving Microsoft intact, the penalties did not have much impact, Verveer said. </p><p>\"Technology will change, business models will change, consumer preferences will change,\" he said. \"You could end up at the end of a long process with something that frankly doesn't make very much difference because the world has moved on.\" </p><p>That's one reason some Facebook critics, including former DOJ antitrust official Gene Kimmelman, argue that imposing restrictions on how social media companies use data could be a more effective strategy than breaking them up.</p><p>A lengthy lawsuit against Facebook would also consume a lot of resources at the DOJ, which might have to hire outside attorneys and other experts as it did in the Microsoft case. The expense could even require additional appropriations from Congress, Schwartzman said. </p><p>\"It is a really daunting enterprise,\" Schwartzman said. \"The likelihood the Justice Department or Federal Trade Commission would be able to undertake such an activity is remote.\" </p><p>Courts have become more conservative when it comes to antitrust doctrine since the 1970s, experts say, requiring the government to prove that anti-competitive behavior has a real economic impact on businesses or consumers. That's widely considered a tougher standard.</p><p>Because of judicial skepticism about the \"breakup solution,\" antitrust enforcers in the Obama administration tended to pursue so-called behavioral remedies for companies getting bigger through mergers, said Kimmelman, who now heads consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge. Those allow a merger to proceed with certain restrictions, without attempting to spin off parts of a company. </p><p>He pointed to the Microsoft antitrust case. In that proceeding, an appeals court overturned a judge's original decision to separate the operating system and browser, saying the Justice Department had not shown enough evidence to justify the move.</p><p>If the government tries to force Facebook to give up WhatsApp and Instagram, it would have to argue the market would be more competitive if those acquisitions had never taken place. But it's tricky to convince a court based on speculative outcomes about the two services, the Mercatus Center's Thierer said. </p><p>WhatsApp and Instagram \"might have failed entirely. They might have succeeded on their own. We don't have any idea how these markets would have shaken out,\" he said. \"The evidentiary burden on these things is very difficult because we don't know how history would have played out differently.\"</p><p>No president can simply decree that a company be dismantled. The antitrust review process is meant to be a regulatory and legal one.</p><p>That issue has already haunted President Donald Trump's administration, which had to rebut accusations that his distaste for CNN motivated the Justice Department's unsuccessful attempt to prevent Time Warner from merging with AT&amp;T. Trump had promised to block the deal on the campaign trail, calling it \"too much concentration of power in the hands of too few,\" and he frequently lambasted Time Warner-owned CNN as a font of \"fake news.\"</p><p>The government ended up losing its court fight, allowing the deal to go through. But the accusations of White House interference in the antitrust arena offered a preview of questions the next president may face in tackling big tech companies.</p><p>Warren has made clear that in her administration, regulators would handle such issues. But she pledged to appoint people in those roles \"who are committed to using existing tools to unwind anti-competitive mergers,\" including Facebook's purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp.</p><p>\"Today's big tech companies have too much power - too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy,\" Warren wrote in a Medium post, which also called for breaking apart Google and Amazon.</p><p>One of her 2020 Democratic rivals, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, warned she is treading on questionable - even Trumpian - territory.</p><p>\"I don't think that a president should be running around pointing at companies and saying breaking them up without any kind of process here,\" Booker said.</p><p>Article originally published on POLITICO Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-1475782</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W70-6DS1-F118-920K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1552\"/><timeReceived>4:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 28, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC0009PXP</classCode><className>AT&amp;T INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This would be a terrible abuse of the law for problems where bigness contributes little and breaking them up won\u2019t solve much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get one gripe off the table \u2014 the increasing size of American businesses has not caused stagnant wages. Most polemics on the subject show that big firms own a larger share of the U.S. market these days but most compete on the global stage where heft is needed to survive against the huge marketing and R&amp;D budgets of Huawei, Tencent and others.</p><p>Amazon employs the most low-skilled workers, and pays $15 an hour without prodding from Mayor de Balsio. New York bodegas required the jackboot of state law to belly up to his idea of fairness.</p><p>The more fundamental complaints against FAGA are privacy \u2014 tracking user web travels, purchases and physical movements to hawk products, fake news from malefactors like the Russians, price gouging and bullying smaller competitors.</p><p>Websites of all sizes harvest data and it\u2019s wrong. Square, the folks that make handy devices for swiping credit cards, recently sent emails with news of a woman\u2019s impending divorce after she paid an attorney a retainer. It also likes to send information about obstetrician visits to wholly uninvolved parties \u2014 all, unapologetically, in the name of making a buck!</p><p>Busting up Google or Facebook, or splitting off Instagram or WhatsApp, won\u2019t fix that. Congress passing a law similar to the EU General Data Privacy Regulation, which requires that users know, understand, and consent to the data collected about them, is closer to the answer. </p><p>Facebook is a natural monopoly and Google\u2019s search engine comes close. Folks are going to gravitate to the platform with the most participants and then eventually all users. This \u201cnetwork effect\u201d requires regulation like the above mentioned EU rules or outlawing platforms where folks congregate to post news \u2014 the latter has serious First Amendment consequences.</p><p>Fake news would be just as easily propagated \u2014 and much tougher to screen and regulate \u2014 on a more fragmented web through web crawling bots, whose messages smaller firms would have fewer resources to screen. The real problem is what to censor without, again, tripping over the First Amendment. </p><p>Apple has taken hellacious price increases, and its share of the global cell phone market, 12 percent, is hardly dominant. Consequently, new iPhone sales are sluggish.</p><p>It is the target of a class action suit for taking 30 percent of the revenue from sales on its App store and limiting apps used on its phones to those sold through its stores. Many retailers markup wholesale prices by more, and Apple earns much of its profits, not by selling users\u2019 personal data, but through those fees. It further protects privacy by screening who can do business on its phones. </p><p>As for Amazon\u2019s monopoly pricing \u2014 it has only about 5 percent of the total retail market\u2014and you try consistently beating its prices, especially including the cost of driving to stores which may or may not have the item you want on the shelves.</p><p>As for abusing its suppliers through the information it gleans about their sales on its platform and then establishing competing brands, Amazon offerings often sport lower prices\u2014just like supermarkets\u2019 house brands. And it has greatly expanded the market for authors of books, who in the past, have been subject to political and cultural screening from politically correct, Ivy League educated editors. </p><p>Now for Google \u2014 most everyone has been aghast by the growth of its ad businesses \u2014 at the expense of local radio, TV, magazines and newspaper. Take a hard look \u2014 web streaming content is killing TV\u2019s grip on prime-time viewers, and the Wall Street Journal, major city dallies and instantaneous web access to news are bludgeoning the six o\u2019clock news, weekly printed matter delivered by mail and smaller newspapers whose only grab on readers are little leaguer scores and bake sales.</p><p>And now Google\u2019s ad business is threatened by Amazon and individually targeted TV ads on streaming platforms.</p><p>Democrats like to behave like God \u2014 dictate behavior right down to your private thoughts \u2014 and as any social philosopher knows, you can\u2019t have God without the devil. For Elizabeth Warren and her fellow travelers, this week\u2019s Satan is FAGA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland and a national columnist.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google\u2019s ad business is threatened by Amazon and individually targeted TV ads on streaming platforms.

This would be a terrible abuse of the law for problems where bigness contributes little and breaking them up won't solve much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get one gripe off the table  the increasing size of American businesses has not caused stagnant wages. Most polemics on the subject show that big firms own a larger share of the U.S. market these days but most compete on the global stage, where heft is needed to survive against the huge marketing and R&amp;D budgets of Huawei, Tencent and others.</p><p>Amazon employs the most low-skilled workers, and pays $15 an hour without prodding from Mayor Bill de Blasio. New York bodegas required the jackboot of state law to belly up to his idea of fairness.</p><p> The more fundamental complaints against Facebook, Apple, Google and Amazon are privacy  tracking user web travels, purchases and physical movements to hawk products, fake news from malefactors like the Russians, price gouging and bullying smaller competitors.</p><p> Websites of all sizes harvest data and it's wrong. Square, the folks that make handy devices for swiping credit cards, recently sent emails with news of a woman's impending divorce after she paid an attorney a retainer. It also likes to send information about obstetrician visits to wholly uninvolved parties  all, unapologetically, in the name of making a buck.</p><p> Busting up Google or Facebook, or splitting off Instagram or WhatsApp, won't fix that. Congress passing a law similar to the EU General Data Privacy Regulation, which requires that users know, understand and consent to the data collected about them, is closer to the answer.</p><p>Facebook is a natural monopoly, and Google's search engine comes close. Folks are going to gravitate to the platform with the most participants and then eventually all users. This \"network effect\" requires regulation like the above mentioned EU rules or outlawing platforms where folks congregate to post news  the latter has serious First Amendment consequences.</p><p> Fake news would be just as easily propagated  and much tougher to screen and regulate  on a more fragmented web through web crawling bots, whose messages smaller firms would have fewer resources to screen. The real problem is what to censor without, again, tripping over the First Amendment.</p><p>Apple has taken hellacious price increases, and its share of the global cellphone market, 12 percent, is hardly dominant. Consequently, new iPhone sales are sluggish.</p><p> It is the target of a class-action suit for taking 30 percent of the revenue from sales on its app store and limiting apps used on its phones to those sold through its stores. Many retailers markup wholesale prices by more, and Apple earns much of its profits, not by selling users' personal data, but through those fees. It further protects privacy by screening who can do business on its phones.</p><p> As for Amazon's monopoly pricing  it has only about 5 percent of the total retail market  and you try consistently beating its prices, especially including the cost of driving to stores which may or may not have the item you want on the shelves.</p><p> As for abusing its suppliers through the information it gleans about their sales on its platform and then establishing competing brands, Amazon offerings often sport lower prices  just like supermarkets' house brands. And it has greatly expanded the market for authors of books, who in the past have been subject to political and cultural screening from politically correct, Ivy League educated editors.</p><p> Now for Google  most everyone has been aghast by the growth of its ad businesses  at the expense of local radio, TV, magazines and newspaper. Take a hard look: Web streaming content is killing TV's grip on prime-time viewers; The Wall Street Journal, major city dallies and instantaneous web access to news are bludgeoning the 6 o'clock news, weekly printed matter delivered by mail and smaller newspapers, whose only grab on readers are little leaguer scores and bake sales.</p><p> And now Google's ad business is threatened by Amazon and individually targeted TV ads on streaming platforms.</p><p> Democrats like to behave like God  dictate behavior right down to your private thoughts  and as any social philosopher knows, you can't have God without the devil. For Elizabeth Warren and her fellow travelers, this week's Satan is FAGA.</p><p> \u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-174473F59199A938</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDS-7FG1-DXVP-V197-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>25 June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

With the economy still reeling from the financial crisis, the idea of smaller, less complicated banks resonated on the left. As late as 2015, the cry was still being heard in Democratic presidential primaries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The slogan appealed not because breaking up the banks would actually prevent another financial crisis, but because it made intuitive sense to people who didn't know very much about the banking industry. It was what I call a Washington Issue - a policy proposal with negligible impact on any real problem that nonetheless gains currency because it can be explained to voters in less than a minute. Good luck doing that with the Basel III accord.</p><p>Now Warren is running for another office, the highest in the land, and she has once again brought out the rhetorical sledgehammer. This time her target is big tech companies. On Friday, in an op-ed posted on Medium and at a rally on the site where Amazon (whose founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, owns The Post) had planned to build a headquarters in New York, Warren announced that she wants to break up Amazon - and Google, and Facebook, and maybe some other firms, too - into their constituent pieces.</p><p>Warren's position is of a piece with her earlier focus on banks: Big is bad. It's also consistent in that it's a Washington Issue that doesn't address any particularly pressing problem, except maybe an inchoate unhappiness with the alienating scale of the modern economy.</p><p>As a longtime skeptic of antitrust, I note that Warren's proposal would probably make the lives of most Americans somewhat worse. Amazon would be forced to divest both Amazon Marketplace and its Amazon Basics line of cheap utility products, meaning those USB cables wouldn't be quite so affordable. Google would be forced to divest its advertising business, a move of little benefit to the average person. It would, however, somewhat impair the cash flows Google uses to fund a bunch of free stuff, such as Gmail and Google Maps.</p><p>Warren argues that breaking up big tech isn't about consumers, at least not directly. It's about enhancing competition, giving smaller tech companies space to grow into the next Amazon or Facebook. Sure, if you're one of a couple hundred people wandering around Silicon Valley with a business plan in your pocket, that might actually help you. Then again, it well might not.</p><p>For Warren's theory to work, you have to believe that both tech firms and antitrust regulators can correctly identify which businesses are likely to pose a threat to big incumbents and force them to stay out of those businesses. But the history of antitrust does not offer much reason to think this is true. Consider the decade-long antitrust case against Microsoft, in which both the firm and regulators obsessed about who was going to control the Web browser, while Google quietly sneaked into the pole position in the race for the Next Big Thing.</p><p>Too, the venture capitalists who fund all these start-ups want to recoup their investment, if not more, and one of the main ways of doing that is by selling out to one of the FAANGs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix or Google. So, ironically, an antitrust move to enhance competition could end up making it harder to finance start-ups in the first place.</p><p>Meanwhile, Warren's plan would do approximately nothing to address a subject that voters do actually care about, at least a little: the fear that occupying such dominant market position gives the FAANGs too much power over our day-to-day lives. The problem is, the companies have that power only because we want the services they provide.</p><p>And since these businesses tend to be characterized by network effects - meaning that sites such as Facebook become more valuable to users as more users join them - you can't break up their core services without taking away something we really want. Splitting Facebook or Amazon or Google Search in two would create substantially less useful services. But slicing off big tech's peripheral offerings won't substantially diminish the power that really bothers people.</p><p>Warren undoubtedly understands that consumers - and voters - would revolt if she actually tried to cut these companies up into less functional parts. So instead she has offered voters a \"solution\" that really solves only one problem: her need for a campaign slogan.</p><p>             Read more:          </p><p>             Helaine Olen: Elizabeth Warren wrote a book of personal finance advice.

Specifically, when using the Census Bureau's most recent\" Supplemental Poverty Measure\" (SPM), California clocks in with a poverty rate of 20 percent, which places it as worst in the nation.  To be sure, California is running quite closely with Florida and Louisiana, but we can certainly say that California is a top contender when it comes to poverty:   This continues to be something of a black eye for California politicians who imagine themselves to be the enlightened elite of North America.\u00a0The fact that one in five Californians is below this poverty line doesn't exactly lend itself to crowing about the state's success in its various wars on poverty.  Many conservative sites have seized on the information to say \"I told you so\" and claim this shows that \"blue-state\" policies fail. </p><p>One should be careful with this, of course, since\u00a0there are plenty of red states\u00a0in the top ten as well.\u00a0Moreover, some blue states, like Massachusetts, are doing moderately well by this measure:   In the realm of political punditry, though, it matters a great deal whether one is using the regular poverty measure, or the SPM.\u00a0For one, in the regular poverty measure, California ranks better than Texas, and leftists love to\u00a0use the standard poverty rate[5]\u00a0to talk about how truly awful Texas and other red states\u00a0are. The Supplemental Poverty Measure\u00a0allows Texans to talk about how awful California is.  If we're going to use census data to guess the prevalence of low-income households, though, the SPM is greatly superior to the old poverty rate. There's a reason, after all, that the Census Bureau developed it, and the Bureau has long warned that poverty rates using the old measure don't make for good comparisons across state lines.  The old poverty measure was a far more crude measure that did not take local costs into account, did not include poverty-assistance income, and basically ignored what can be immense differences in the cost of living in different locations.\u00a0Many commentators often love to note how the median household income in many red states are below the national average \u2014 but then conveniently ignore how low the cost of living is in those places.  The SPM, on the other hand, takes into account the costs of \"food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and a small additional amount to allow for other needs\" It includes government benefits, but also subtracts taxes. (A full explanation\u00a0is here[6].)  The end result shouldn't really be all that surprising:\u00a0once we take into account the actual cost of living, including taxes, we find that poverty is actually quite high in California.  How to Alleviate Poverty  There are only two ways to reduce poverty and increase the standard of living:  Increase household income  Lower the cost of living  Poverty can be alleviated by simply increasing income. Or it can be done by simply reducing the cost of living. Ideally, both things\u00a0happen\u00a0at once, and fortunately, that's usually how it works.  The greatest reductions in global poverty have come about due to the spread of capital and industrial production methods.\u00a0This is because better and more widespread use of capital leads to two things:  1. It increases household income by increasing worker productivity. That is, each worker can produce more stuff of higher value. This means each worker can take home a higher income.  2. When we produce more stuff more quickly, that stuff becomes more affordable. Thanks to labor-saving and more efficient machinery, for example, fewer people can make more cars more quickly. In turn, more people can afford more cars because cars are more plentiful, and less expensive.  Over time, more people can buy more stuff at lower prices, thus increasing their standard of living.\u00a0Even better, thanks to modern capital, those people can also produce more during the hours they work, making it possible to buy even more stuff. Both pieces work together to increase living standards.  One of the biggest problems California is facing right now, though, is that government interventions in the marketplace are making it harder and harder to produce more stuff, thus driving up prices.  The end result is a higher cost of living, and thus more poverty. Kerry Jackson at The\u00a0LA Times\u00a0notes:\u00a0[7]  Further contributing to the poverty problem is California's housing crisis. More than four in 10 households spent more than 30% of their income on housing in 2015. A shortage of available units has driven prices ever higher, far above income increases. And that shortage is a direct outgrowth of misguided policies.  'Counties and local governments have imposed restrictive land-use regulations that drove up the price of land and dwellings,' explains analyst Wendell Cox. 'Middle-income households have been forced to accept lower standards of living while the less fortunate have been driven into poverty by the high cost of housing.' The California Environmental Quality Act, passed in 1971, is one example; it can add $1 million to the cost of completing a housing development, says Todd Williams, an Oakland attorney who chairs the Wendel Rosen Black ...an land-use group. CEQA costs have been known to shut down entire homebuilding projects. CEQA reform would help increase housing supply, but there's no real movement to change the law.  Extensive environmental regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions make energy more expensive, also hurting the poor. By some estimates, California energy costs are as much as 50% higher than the national average. Jonathan A. Lesser of Continental Economics, author of a 2015 Manhattan Institute study, 'Less Carbon, Higher Prices,' found that 'in 2012, nearly 1 million California households faced energy expenditures exceeding 10% of household income. In certain California counties, the rate of energy poverty was as high as 15% of all households.' A Pacific Research Institute study by Wayne Winegarden found that the rate could exceed 17% of median income in some areas.  It is increasingly becoming common knowledge that California is notoriously bad in terms of the cost of housing.  Every time a new \"top ten\" list of least-affordable housing markets is published, California cities often dominate the top of the list.\u00a0In this list[8], for example, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and San Diego are all in the top ten.  Housing is perhaps the poster child for the impossibility of getting ahead in California. Much of this is due to locally-based NIMBYism in which local governments actively intervene to reduce new housing construction for the sake of \"preserving the character\" of the neighborhoods. This is just another way of sawing: \"rich people like things the way they are, so you poor people can just get lost. We're not building any more housing.\"  These same rich people then later pat themselves on the back for voting Democratic and \"doing something\" about poverty.  But it's not all just local regulations. As Jackson notes, environmental regulations are especially burdensome on businesses, thus driving up the cost of everything. This is especially true of housing\u00a0which requires land, water resources, and visibly impacts the local environment.  These regulations, mind you, are all imposed on top of already existing federal regulations, and in addition to the environmental regulations that already function with a lower burden to business in other states. Coloradans, for example, aren't exactly living in rivers of toxic sludge, in spite of having fewer environmental regulations \u2014 and cheaper housing.  Nor is housing the only industry impacted by these regulations. Mountains of anti-business regulations in the state also make it harder to start new businesses, hire people, and cover the basic costs of expanding worker productivity. Fewer workers get hired. Less capital is deployed to workers. The end result is that worker productivity growth can't keep up with increases in the cost of living. Poverty results.  Recognizing this vise in which the poor are caught in California, the response is always the same:\u00a0more rent control, more regulations, more more costly hoops for employers to jump through.  \"We're taming capitalism!\" the politicians tell themselves.\u00a0Unfortunately, they've driven a fifth of the population into poverty in the process.  But don't expect things to improve for the poor in California any time soon. California is perhaps the single biggest\u00a0example in the US of how stylish locales become playgrounds for the rich, and a treadmill to nowhere for everyone else.  In recent years, news outlets have carried a number of articles on how workers in silicon valley are\u00a0living in their cars[9].Sometimes, the homeless even\u00a0have jobs[10]\u00a0at the big tech firms like Facebook. Nearly all of these homeless people have jobs of some sort, though. Thanks to the ruling classes of California, though, a basic apartment is $3,000 per month, while food and gasoline aren't exactly cheap.  The well-to-do tell themselves that the high cost of living is simply \"the cost of doing business\" for living in such a wonderful place with so many enlightened, intelligent, and beautiful people.\u00a0People can go to the beach whenever they want, and life is wonderful.  Of course, anyone who has actually lived in California as a non-wealthy person knows that one most certainly can't go to the beach \"whenever you want.\"\u00a0If one is working two jobs to pay the rent, a day at the beach \u2014 after sitting in traffic and paying for parking \u2014 isn't exactly a regular event.\u00a0Moreover, the communities with non-sky-high rents are generally found well inland, and aren't exactly next to Malibu.  This may help explain why, as the Sacramento Bee reported last year,\u00a0California is exporting its poor to Texas[11].\u00a0The beaches aren't as nice in Texas, but many of these migrants\u00a0are trading in the beaches \u2014 which they never see anyway \u2014 for an affordable apartment.

For one, in the regular poverty measure, California ranks better than Texas, and leftists love to\u00a0use the standard poverty rate\u00a0to talk about how truly awful Texas and other red states\u00a0are. The Supplemental Poverty Measure\u00a0allows Texans to talk about how awful California is.</p><p>If we're going to use census data to guess the prevalence of low-income households, though, the SPM is greatly superior to the old poverty rate. There's a reason, after all, that the Census Bureau developed it, and the Bureau has long warned that poverty rates using the old measure don't make for good comparisons across state lines.</p><p>The old poverty measure was a far more crude measure that did not take local costs into account, did not include poverty-assistance income, and basically ignored what can be immense differences in the cost of living in different locations. Many commentators often love to note how the median household income in many red states are below the national average \u2014 but then conveniently ignore how low the cost of living is in those places.</p><p>The SPM, on the other hand, takes into account the costs of \"food, clothing, shelter, and utilities, and a small additional amount to allow for other needs\" It includes government benefits, but also subtracts taxes. (A full explanation\u00a0is here.)</p><p>The end result shouldn't really be all that surprising: once we take into account the actual cost of living, including taxes, we find that poverty is actually quite high in California.</p><p>How to Alleviate Poverty</p><p>There are only two ways to reduce poverty and increase the standard of living:</p><p>Increase household income<br/>Lower the cost of living</p><p>Poverty can be alleviated by simply increasing income. Or it can be done by simply reducing the cost of living. Ideally, both things\u00a0happen\u00a0at once, and fortunately, that's usually how it works.</p><p>The greatest reductions in global poverty have come about due to the spread of capital and industrial production methods. This is because better and more widespread use of capital leads to two things:</p><p>1. It increases household income by increasing worker productivity. That is, each worker can produce more stuff of higher value. This means each worker can take home a higher income.</p><p>2. When we produce more stuff more quickly, that stuff becomes more affordable. Thanks to labor-saving and more efficient machinery, for example, fewer people can make more cars more quickly. In turn, more people can afford more cars because cars are more plentiful, and less expensive.</p><p>Over time, more people can buy more stuff at lower prices, thus increasing their standard of living. Even better, thanks to modern capital, those people can also produce more during the hours they work, making it possible to buy even more stuff. Both pieces work together to increase living standards.</p><p>One of the biggest problems California is facing right now, though, is that government interventions in the marketplace are making it harder and harder to produce more stuff, thus driving up prices.</p><p>The end result is a higher cost of living, and thus more poverty. Kerry Jackson at The\u00a0LA Times\u00a0notes:\u00a0</p><p>Further contributing to the poverty problem is California's housing crisis. More than four in 10 households spent more than 30% of their income on housing in 2015. A shortage of available units has driven prices ever higher, far above income increases. And that shortage is a direct outgrowth of misguided policies.</p><p>\"Counties and local governments have imposed restrictive land-use regulations that drove up the price of land and dwellings,\" explains analyst Wendell Cox. \"Middle-income households have been forced to accept lower standards of living while the less fortunate have been driven into poverty by the high cost of housing.\" The California Environmental Quality Act, passed in 1971, is one example; it can add $1 million to the cost of completing a housing development, says Todd Williams, an Oakland attorney who chairs the Wendel Rosen Black &amp; Dean land-use group. CEQA costs have been known to shut down entire homebuilding projects. CEQA reform would help increase housing supply, but there's no real movement to change the law.</p><p>Extensive environmental regulations aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions make energy more expensive, also hurting the poor. By some estimates, California energy costs are as much as 50% higher than the national average. Jonathan A. Lesser of Continental Economics, author of a 2015 Manhattan Institute study, \"Less Carbon, Higher Prices,\" found that \"in 2012, nearly 1 million California households faced \u2026 energy expenditures exceeding 10% of household income. In certain California counties, the rate of energy poverty was as high as 15% of all households.\" A Pacific Research Institute study by Wayne Winegarden found that the rate could exceed 17% of median income in some areas.</p><p>It is increasingly becoming common knowledge that California is notoriously bad in terms of the cost of housing.</p><p>Every time a new \"top ten\" list of least-affordable housing markets is published, California cities often dominate the top of the list.\u00a0In this list, for example, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and San Diego are all in the top ten.</p><p>Housing is perhaps the poster child for the impossibility of getting ahead in California. Much of this is due to locally-based NIMBYism in which local governments actively intervene to reduce new housing construction for the sake of \"preserving the character\" of the neighborhoods. This is just another way of sawing: \"rich people like things the way they are, so you poor people can just get lost. We're not building any more housing.\"</p><p>These same rich people then later pat themselves on the back for voting Democratic and \"doing something\" about poverty.</p><p>But it's not all just local regulations. As Jackson notes, environmental regulations are especially burdensome on businesses, thus driving up the cost of everything. This is especially true of housing\u00a0which requires land, water resources, and visibly impacts the local environment.</p><p>These regulations, mind you, are all imposed on top of already existing federal regulations, and in addition to the environmental regulations that already function with a lower burden to business in other states. Coloradans, for example, aren't exactly living in rivers of toxic sludge, in spite of having fewer environmental regulations \u2014 and cheaper housing.</p><p>Nor is housing the only industry impacted by these regulations. Mountains of anti-business regulations in the state also make it harder to start new businesses, hire people, and cover the basic costs of expanding worker productivity. Fewer workers get hired. Less capital is deployed to workers. The end result is that worker productivity growth can't keep\u00a0 up with increases in the cost of living. Poverty results.</p><p>Recognizing this vise in which the poor are caught in California, the response is always the same: more rent control, more regulations, more more costly hoops for employers to jump through.</p><p>\"We're taming capitalism!\" the politicians tell themselves. Unfortunately, they've driven a fifth of the population into poverty in the process.</p><p>But don't expect things to improve for the poor in California any time soon. California is perhaps the single biggest\u00a0example in the US of how stylish locales become playgrounds for the rich, and a treadmill to nowhere for everyone else.</p><p>In recent years, news outlets have carried a number of articles on how workers in silicon valley are\u00a0living in their cars. Sometimes, the homeless even\u00a0have jobs\u00a0at the big tech firms like Facebook. Nearly all of these homeless people have jobs of some sort, though. Thanks to the ruling classes of California, though, a basic apartment is $3,000 per month, while food and gasoline aren't exactly cheap.</p><p>The well-to-do tell themselves that the high cost of living is simply \"the cost of doing business\" for living in such a wonderful place with so many enlightened, intelligent, and beautiful people. People can go to the beach whenever they want, and life is wonderful.</p><p>Of course, anyone who has actually lived in California as a non-wealthy person knows that one most certainly can't go to the beach \"whenever you want.\" If one is working two jobs to pay the rent, a day at the beach \u2014 after sitting in traffic and paying for parking \u2014 isn't exactly a regular event. Moreover, the communities with non-sky-high rents are generally found well inland, and aren't exactly next to Malibu.</p><p>This may help explain why, as the Sacramento Bee reported last year, California is exporting its poor to Texas. The beaches aren't as nice in Texas, but many of these migrants\u00a0are trading in the beaches \u2014 which they never see anyway \u2014 for an affordable apartment.</p><p>About the author:<br/><br/>*Ryan McMaken\u00a0(@ryanmcmaken) is the editor of Mises Wire and The Austrian.

That's the grand experiment that we are living with. The thing is, we don't know what the right balance of regulation versus economic enablement is.\"</p><p>Hopkins, whose clients have included the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve, says the scale and speed of the big tech companies, which constitute FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) plus Microsoft, are going beyond what regulators can keep up with.</p><p>\"Regulators move too slowly, and the tech giants are one or two steps ahead,\" says Hopkins. \"The answer is you have to learn how to be flexible. That's difficult to do and some of these decisions will be hard to make.\"</p><p>Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau was in Chantilly, France last week meeting with his G7 counterparts to talk about how to tax and regulate big technology companies.</p><p>A Canadian federal legislative review panel struck under the Heritage and Innovation departments is also working on that very question. And what they determine will have an impact on whether future generations of Canadians sink or swim in the digital economy.</p><p>There have been particular concerns with Facebook from government regulators. MPs earlier this year voted unanimously to issue a standing summons for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg after they refused to testify before an Ottawa committee on digital regulation. The privacy commissioner is also suing the company over data-related breaches. And in the U.S., the company was fined a record $5 billion this month over privacy violations.</p><p>There is also concern over foreign influence in the upcoming federal election using social media. Facebook has said it will regulate itself and take down any accounts that try to interfere.</p><p>\"So much of public opinion is now shaped, not by curated trusted news sources, but the stuff that gets posted on Facebook, and that's powerful when you have 2.7 billion users of their apps,\" says Hopkins. \"Facebook has more of a reach on what we think and the implications are huge.\"</p><p>Another issue is that much of the \"news,\" or what comes onto newsfeeds on social media platforms, is developed by artificial intelligence.</p><p>\"Do you want what you know about the world to be based on what an algorithm thinks you should see?\" Algorithms are developed by humans who have inherent biases, says Hopkins.</p><p>Still, he insists the tech giants are \"not evil. They are simply forcing us to rethink what the digital ethics of the 21st century should be.\"</p><p>One big discussion currently is whether Toronto should give the go-ahead to an ambitious plan by Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google's parent company, to build a new smart city on the Toronto waterfront. The company has committed $1.3 billion to the project, but critics say the collection of data and how it will be used is concerning.</p><p>\"I think it's easy for us to villainize these companies, but ultimately I believe they are good for us,\" says Hopkins. \"Money is certainly at stake, but most of these companies have a socially progressive west coast ethic, and at some level aren't purely corporate profiteers. But they are certainly pushing the bounds of digital ethics and the notions of what is public and what is private. And that's what we have to figure out: How do we let them innovate but without surrendering the rights we hold dear?\"</p><p>Canada and other western democracies are being leapfrogged by former developing countries as the new technologies are being implemented, says Hopkins.</p><p>Part of the issue, he argues, is political and cultural. That's where the debate over regulation gets murkier. And that has implications for projects such as Sidewalk Labs in Toronto.</p><p>\"China is doing surveillance in a way that is not acceptable to western democracies. Are we disadvantaged because of that, and will it hold back economic development? There are sets of values that we hold dear while other countries are accelerating and growing economically because they violate our norms. We have to decide how to maintain that balance.\"</p><p>Hopkins says, in reality, Canada has no choice but to let tech giants self-regulate since government doesn't have the tools to \"work at their scale and speed.\"</p><p>\"You have to essentially put in checks and balances that ensure that Facebook is regulating itself properly. The stick is that as a country you can cut Facebook off if they don't abide by those rules,\" says Hopkins. \"But to actually do the policing and regulation for them would be very tough.\"</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, announced recently that it is looking at launching its own cryptocurrency called Libra, which Hopkins says is both \"brilliant\" and dangerous at the same time.</p><p>\"It's a brilliant move because they already have such a big reach but now they would be in charge of a system that will turn them into a bank with responsibility for potentially billions of dollars worth of payments. Look at the requirements and scrutiny that banks have to go through. We would have to rethink the rules once again.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

That's the grand experiment that we are living with. The thing is, we don't know what the right balance of regulation versus economic enablement is.\"</p><p>Hopkins, whose clients have included the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. Federal Reserve, says the scale and speed of the big tech companies, which constitute FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google) plus Microsoft, are going beyond what regulators can keep up with.</p><p>\"Regulators move too slowly, and the tech giants are one or two steps ahead,\" says Hopkins. \"The answer is you have to learn how to be flexible. That's difficult to do and some of these decisions will be hard to make.\"</p><p>Canada's Finance Minister Bill Morneau was in Chantilly, France last week meeting with his G7 counterparts to talk about how to tax and regulate big technology companies.</p><p>A Canadian federal legislative review panel struck under the Heritage and Innovation departments is also working on that very question. And what they determine will have an impact on whether future generations of Canadians sink or swim in the digital economy.</p><p>There have been particular concerns with Facebook from government regulators. MPs earlier this year voted unanimously to issue a standing summons for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg after they refused to testify before an Ottawa committee on digital regulation. The privacy commissioner is also suing the company over data-related breaches. And in the U.S., the company was fined a record $5 billion this month over privacy violations.</p><p>There is also concern over foreign influence in the upcoming federal election using social media. Facebook has said it will regulate itself and take down any accounts that try to interfere.</p><p>\"So much of public opinion is now shaped, not by curated trusted news sources, but the stuff that gets posted on Facebook, and that's powerful when you have 2.7 billion users of their apps,\" says Hopkins. \"Facebook has more of a reach on what we think and the implications are huge.\"</p><p>Another issue is that much of the \"news,\" or what comes onto newsfeeds on social media platforms, is developed by artificial intelligence.</p><p>\"Do you want what you know about the world to be based on what an algorithm thinks you should see?\" Algorithms are developed by humans who have inherent biases, says Hopkins.</p><p>Still, he insists the tech giants are \"not evil. They are simply forcing us to rethink what the digital ethics of the 21st century should be.\"</p><p>One big discussion currently is whether Toronto should give the go-ahead to an ambitious plan by Sidewalk Labs, a subsidiary of Alphabet, Google's parent company, to build a new smart city on the Toronto waterfront. The company has committed $1.3 billion to the project, but critics say the collection of data and how it will be used is concerning.</p><p>\"I think it's easy for us to villainize these companies, but ultimately I believe they are good for us,\" says Hopkins. \"Money is certainly at stake, but most of these companies have a socially progressive west coast ethic, and at some level aren't purely corporate profiteers. But they are certainly pushing the bounds of digital ethics and the notions of what is public and what is private. And that's what we have to figure out: How do we let them innovate but without surrendering the rights we hold dear?\"</p><p>Canada and other western democracies are being leapfrogged by former developing countries as the new technologies are being implemented, says Hopkins.</p><p>Part of the issue, he argues, is political and cultural. That's where the debate over regulation gets murkier. And that has implications for projects such as Sidewalk Labs in Toronto.</p><p>\"China is doing surveillance in a way that is not acceptable to western democracies. Are we disadvantaged because of that, and will it hold back economic development? There are sets of values that we hold dear while other countries are accelerating and growing economically because they violate our norms. We have to decide how to maintain that balance.\"</p><p>Hopkins says, in reality, Canada has no choice but to let tech giants self-regulate since government doesn't have the tools to \"work at their scale and speed.\"</p><p>\"You have to essentially put in checks and balances that ensure that Facebook is regulating itself properly. The stick is that as a country you can cut Facebook off if they don't abide by those rules,\" says Hopkins. \"But to actually do the policing and regulation for them would be very tough.\"</p><p>Facebook meanwhile, announced recently that it is looking at launching its own cryptocurrency called Libra, which Hopkins says is both \"brilliant\" and dangerous at the same time.</p><p>\"It's a brilliant move because they already have such a big reach but now they would be in charge of a system that will turn them into a bank with responsibility for potentially billions of dollars worth of payments. Look at the requirements and scrutiny that banks have to go through. We would have to rethink the rules once again.\"</p><p>Tony Wong is the Star's technology reporter covering big tech, disinformation and regulation.

Predictably, this lofty proclamation has met with both elation and skepticism. But the statement is notable not so much for its content as for what it reveals about how U.S. CEOs think. Apparently, America's corporate leaders believe they can decide freely whom they serve. But as agents, rather than principals, that decision really isn't theirs to make.The fact that American CEOs think they can choose their own masters attests not just to their own sense of entitlement, but also to the state of corporate America, where power over globe-spanning business empires is concentrated in the hands of just a few men (and far fewer women). As a matter of corporate law, CEOs are appointed by a company's directors, who in turn are elected by that company's shareholders every year. In practical terms, though, most directors remain on the board for years on end, as do the officers they appoint.</p><p>For example, Jamie Dimon, the chairman of the Business Roundtable's own board of directors, has been at the helm of JPMorgan Chase for over 15 years. During most of that time, he has served as both CEO and chairman of the board of directors, in contravention of corporate-governance principles that recommend separating these two positions.</p><p>By capturing the process to which they owe their own positions, American CEOs have made a mockery of shareholder control. The Business Roundtable itself has long favored plurality over majority voting, which means that incumbent board members need only receive more votes than anybody else, rather than a majority. At the same time, the organization has fought the Securities and Exchange Commission tooth and nail to block a rule that would allow shareholders to write in their own candidates when votes are solicited. And it continues to try to weaken shareholders' ability to propose agenda items for shareholder meetings.</p><p>In short, for the Business Roundtable and the CEOs it represents, shareholder primacy has never meant shareholder democracy. Instead, the shareholder-value model has given CEOs cover to avoid discussing corporate strategy, especially when it comes to considering alternatives to the share price as a metric for corporate performance. For CEOs, the share price is everything, because it protects the company from takeovers (the greatest threat to incumbent managers), and it increases their own remuneration.</p><p>Why, then, would CEOs come out against a status quo that has allowed them to reign almost unchallenged, in favor of a stakeholder-governance model that puts employees and the environment on an equal footing with shareholders? The answer is that revolutions often devour their children. Share-price primacy has not only ceased to protect CEOs in the way it once did; it has become a threat.</p><p>After all, it is one thing to champion shareholders when they are too dispersed to organize themselves. It is quite a different matter when shareholders have assembled into blocs with effective veto power and the ability to coordinate in pursuit of common goals. Some 74 percent of JPMorgan Chase's shares are held by institutional investors, five of which - including Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street - control one-third of total shares. And JPMorgan isn't alone. Recent research in the U.S. shows that the same few global asset managers are top shareholders at almost all of the largest financial intermediaries, Big Tech firms, and airline companies.</p><p>For CEOs, the emergence of powerful shareholder blocs has changed the corporate-governance game. With trillions of dollars of savings that need to be invested, institutional investors simply cannot be ignored. Even if asset managers do not actively involve themselves in corporate governance, they can still send a powerful signal to the market simply by dumping shares. For years, the shareholder-primacy model led CEOs to eke out profits through outsourcing or labor-force downsizing, regulatory and tax arbitrage, and stock buybacks that shower cash on shareholders at the expense of investing in their companies' future. But now, they have finally realized that these strategies are better for institutional investors than they are for the sustainability of firms.</p><p>Confronted with the headwinds they themselves generated, American CEOs seem to have concluded that best defense is a good offense. But if they are serious about abandoning the shareholder-primacy model, public statements will not suffice. They must also support legal reforms, particularly the measures needed to hold corporate directors and officers accountable to the principals they serve. That could mean extending board representation to employees and other stakeholders, or it could take the form of special audits, along the lines of those to which public benefit corporations submit.</p><p>Either way, if the new stakeholder model is going to amount to more than the old charade of \"shareholder democracy,\" the principals themselves must be involved in setting up the new regime. If we leave it for the agents to decide for themselves, we will end up right back where we started.</p><p>Katharina Pistor is professor of comparative law at Columbia Law School and the author of \"The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality.\" THE DAILY STAR publishes this commentary in collaboration with Project Syndicate  (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</url> ).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TDASTA-152595760</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TDASTA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WXJ-W1R1-F11P-X11D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335154</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"915\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Star - The Daily Star FZ LLC.

But Chinese regulators are mostly concerned about WeChat being used to spread \"fake news\" and anti-government comments, along with the use of false online identities to cloak dissident activity, say people with knowledge of the company.</p><p>By law, Tencent is responsible for keeping illegal content off its news feeds and other platforms - including anything that endangers \"national honour and interests\" or undermines \"national unity.\" China's new cybersecurity law also requires companies to police their web platforms for illegal content, and Tencent has been penalized at least twice for violations since the law went into force last year.</p><p>Incursions from government regulators go beyond WeChat. Tencent also has a big presence in gaming and mobile payments, and last year, state-run media attacked the company's top mobile game as addictive \"poison.\"</p><p>Tencent declined to comment. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which oversees internet content, didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>WeChat has measures in place to prevent people from using the platform to organize large groups, which is believed to be why China blocked Facebook, Twitter and other Western social-media platforms in 2009.</p><p>No official reason was given, but it followed state-media reports blaming social media for fomenting unrest among China's Muslim minority.</p><p>On WeChat, chat groups are limited to 500 members, and once a group tops 100 members the account of each new member must be linked to a verified mobile-phone account with a state-owned telecommunications company.</p><p>There is a perception among many in China that WeChat is monitored by the government, and Chinese activists and others say they have been questioned by authorities over what they thought were private comments on the app.</p><p>Tencent says it doesn't store WeChat messages on its servers and authorities don't have access to them. Yet messages aren't encrypted in the same way they are on Facebook's WhatsApp; people familiar with the matter say Tencent can save and hand them over at the request of police.</p><p>What is more, the mere perception that the government has access to WeChat data is a hindrance to its growth overseas, people close to the company say.</p><p>These concerns come as U.S. technology companies like Facebook Inc. too are fending off government inquiries on use of customer data and other issues.</p><p>All big tech companies in China, including Tencent rival Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., face government scrutiny. But the scrutiny on Tencent is more intense given WeChat's role as a social network.</p><p>\"Alibaba is just a consumer service where you buy and sell things,\" said X.L. Ding, a social science professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. \"Tencent is different because it has a function of propaganda and spreading information.\"</p><p>As government scrutiny has intensified, Tencent Chief Executive Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, has stepped up to serve as its point man with regulators. While not a Communist Party member, the 46-year-old billionaire has been an active participant in China's National People's Congress, the party's tightly controlled annual political meeting.</p><p>Mr. Ma and other executives are spending more time meeting government demands, according to people close to the company. Regulatory changes and other actions that could impact Tencent's products and services come up frequently at board meetings, these people say.</p><p>\"He's an introvert, but he's accepted what he needs to do,\" one Tencent executive said of Mr. Ma's lead role in dealing with high-ranking government officials. The executive added that Mr. Ma would much rather be immersed in developing new products and services. Mr. Ma declined to comment.</p><p>His myriad NPC duties this March forced Tencent to delay release of its annual results; it would be hard to imagine an American company doing the same because its chief executive was away at a political convention.</p><p>Mr. Ma moves quickly to get his company out of the crosshairs. Last year, the Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper published scathing editorials about Tencent's game Honor of Kings, saying schoolchildren were dozing in class because they stayed up late playing the game. Tencent's shares fell more than 3% on the Hong Kong stock exchange.</p><p>Tencent slapped limits on play time for anyone under 18, and Mr. Ma travelled to Beijing to make peace, posing for photographs with People's Daily executives at the newspaper's offices. Its shares reversed their decline.</p><p>\"The company is showing they implicitly understand the agenda of the people who ... regulate them,\" said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research, who has followed Tencent for years.</p><p>Tencent, which has more than 45,000 employees, recently began moving into a new $600 million Shenzhen headquarters, a futuristic complex with skywalks linking twin skyscrapers.</p><p>The architects had a bold plan for the executive suite. They wanted to station Mr. Ma and his top lieutenants in a central command post with high visibility, like the bridge on a battleship.</p><p>That wouldn't do, architects were told. One reason: Too many government officials come calling, and their visits need to be discreet.</p><p>The executive offices were placed instead in the upper reaches of the highest tower.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2018071046796595</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SS9-6X51-JDH3-G3SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"999\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

Some questions remain, including the impact on commercial banks as well as Big Tech companies such as Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings Ltd. that already offer payment services. Behind China's rush is a desire to manage technological change on its own terms. As one PBOC official put it, currency isn't only an economic issue, it's also about sovereignty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WHAT'S THE PLAN? Not all the details are out, but according to new patents registered by the PBOC and official speeches, it could work something like this: Consumers and businesses would download a digital wallet on their mobile phone and load the digital cash from their account at a commercial bank - similar to going to an ATM. They then use that like cash to make and receive payments with anyone else who also has a digital wallet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AREN'T MOST TRANSACTIONS ALREADY ELECTRONIC?</p><p>Yes. China is increasingly a cashless society. Even street-food sellers in small towns will prefer to use a mobile payment app than make actual change. In the first quarter of 2019, such apps handled 59 trillion yuan (US$8.3 trillion) of transactions in China, up 15 per cent from a year earlier, according to research firm Analysys. Ant Financial's Alipay handled almost half of that, followed by Tencent's WeChat Pay with a third. The PBOC says all non-cash transactions (which also includes such things as credit, debit and stored-value cards, bank transfers and checks) totalled 3.8 quadrillion yuan in 2018. The trend is hardly unique to China: A central bank survey in Sweden found that only 13 per cent of people in 2018 paid for their most-recent purchase in cash, down from 39 per cent in 2010.</p><p>SO WHY IS THE PBOC DOING THIS?</p><p>There are important regulatory and political considerations. Having the ability to track money electronically as it changes hands would be useful in combating money laundering and other illegal activities. The project was started by former PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan, who retired in March 2018. He wanted to protect China from having to some day adopt a standard, like Bitcoin, designed and controlled by others. Facebook Inc.'s push to introduce its own digital coin, called Libra, in 2020 may be speeding things up, as it could end up strengthening the dollar's dominance - and weakening China's capital controls. As the head of the PBOC's research bureau, Wang Xin, put it in July, that could have \"economic, financial and even international political consequences.\"</p><p>IS IT A CRYPTOCURRENCY?</p><p>Probably not. When we say cryptocurrency, we usually mean an offering such as Bitcoin that uses decentralized, online ledgers known as blockchain to verify and record transactions. It and others such as Ethereum support anonymous transfers without the need for a middleman - or a central bank. The wild volatility in their value, however, makes them ill-suited for use as a means of payment. Libra will also be a cryptocurrency, but a so-called stablecoin, 100 per cent backed by a basket of securities and real-life currencies such as the dollar, euro, pound and yen. Because those don't fluctuate much, Libra's value should be steady as well. Initially at least, Libra will be run by private companies including Facebook, Visa and Uber. The PBOC will, of course, back the digital yuan, making the currency the opposite of decentralized. It's also not certain that it will use blockchain, either.</p><p>WHY NOT USE EXISTING COINS?</p><p>China banned cryptocurrency exchanges and so-called initial coin offerings in 2017 amid a broad effort to cleanse risk from its financial system and clamp down on so-called shadow banking. They can still be traded, but through a slower, more restrictive process. Digital currencies also could provide a way to move money out of China, potentially adding to capital outflows that would undermine the yuan's value. Even though Libra isn't out yet, Chinese officials have called for oversight by monetary authorities. (Facebook's website is banned in China, but many Chinese access it via a workaround called a virtual private network, or VPN.)</p><p>WHY NOT USE BLOCKCHAIN?</p><p>The PBOC has considered it, but researchers have expressed doubts about whether the technology would be able to support a large volume of simultaneous transactions. China's annual Singles'Day shopping gala in 2018 had payment demand peaking at 92,771 transactions per second, far above what Bitcoin's blockchain could support, according to another central bank official, Mu Changchun.</p><p>HOW ABOUT PRIVACY?</p><p>The bank wants to \"strike a balance\" between anonymity and the need to crack down on financial crimes, Mu said, but it's unclear what that means. The PBOC has said that user information won't be completely exposed to banks. But user identities will likely be tied to individual wallets, giving authorities another window into people's lives. PBOC Deputy Governor Fan Yifei suggested in an article in 2018 that banks may need to submit daily information on transactions and that there could be caps on transactions by individuals.</p><p>WHEN'S IT COMING? Soon, it seems. Mu said in August that the digital cash is \"close to being out.\" The PBOC has been looking into a digital currency since at least 2014, and it's been recruiting staff for a dedicated institute. Research and innovation regarding digital currencies was mentioned in the grand plan to make Shenzhen, the technology hub next to Hong Kong, into a world-class city by 2025.</p><p>WILL PEOPLE USE IT? It's hard to say. The PBOC's digital wallet is just a wallet, at least for now, whereas the incumbents Alipay and WeChat Pay are deeply embedded in a whole world of social media, e-commerce, ride-hailing, bill-paying, investments and other functions. Da Hongfei, the Shanghai-based founder of open-sourced blockchain platform Neo, said he can't see why the general public would choose the PBOC's digital currency over something as handy as Alipay.</p><p>HOW WILL BANKS BE AFFECTED?</p><p>Mainly in bookkeeping.</p><p>Digital cash would have to be kept separate from regular savings, because it represents money in actual circulation (known in central banking parlance as M0), not the so-called demand deposits (M1) which banks use to lend out again to companies and households. Commercial lenders would deposit 100 per cent worth of reserves at the central bank in exchange for digital currency, which it then distributes to retail users. The two-tier system also reduces the burden on the PBOC to perform due diligence, revamp IT systems and answer client requests.</p><p>ANY ECONOMIC IMPACT?</p><p>Probably not immediately.</p><p>As the PBOC's digital money is designed to replace cash, it won't have a big impact on the broad money supply, and thereby its affect on monetary policy will likely be neutral. If the digital currency is widely accepted and people are encouraged to hold more cash, bank deposits could decline, but the impact will be manageable, according to a 2018 article from the PBOC's digital currency research institute. In a more distant future, the central bank might use digital currency to help steer the economy. Patent filings made public in October 2018 described a currency that would require banks making loans to input details about borrowers and interest rates before funds could be transferred. That could allow the PBOC to more proactively control bank lending and direct funding where it deems appropriate. Furthermore, should there be a need for China to turn to an unconventional monetary policy tool kit, digitized currency would allow it to apply negative rates even for people holding digital cash.</p><p>WHAT ARE OTHER CENTRAL BANKS DOING?</p><p>Uruguay has done a pilot program, called e-Peso, that was praised by the International Monetary Fund. Venezuela has a controversial offering called the petro, and Sweden's Riksbank is exploring an e-krona. Last month, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney called for Libra-like reserve currency to end the dollar's dominance. An anonymous survey by the Bank for International Settlements in early 2019 showed most of the global central banks are participating in theoretical and conceptual research. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Surrounded by hills...</p><p>All around a small city near China's border with Vietnam, posters and billboards carry the slogan \u201cBuilding Smart City\u201d. Surrounded by hills and lakes, the town \u2014 whose name the Nikkei Asian Review is not publishing to protect its sources \u2014 is still a relative backwater, in one of the least developed regions of the country.</p><p>Most of the residents did not get access to the internet until the late 2000s. In a corner office on the fifth floor of the city hall, though, they now have a dedicated Department of Smart City Development. The official in charge, who gave his name as Cao, is in his 50s and near retirement. His background is in architecture, and he had no experience in technology until he was promoted to head the department in early 2018.</p><p>\u201cI have no idea what \u2018smart city\u2019 or \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 is. But I know the goal is to build an \u2018artificial intelligence-powered smart city\u2019,\u201d Cao said. In practice, that means most of his days are spent listening to pitches from private companies. \u201cIt is the companies\u2019 job to come up with the right projects or products that can help my department to reach that goal,\u201d he said.</p><p>China\u2019s national and local governments have rolled out the red carpet for domestic companies developing artificial intelligence, as Beijing tries to gain a strategic lead over other nations in a new technological arms race. The approach, which has seen the public sector provide money, contracts and, crucially, access to enormous quantities of data, has allowed local companies to take huge strides.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2018, Chinese companies filed more AI-related patents than their US counterparts. In 2018 alone, the country was responsible for 30,000 new patent filings in artificial intelligence: a tenfold increase in just five years, according to research by Nikkei released in March.</p><p>But, impressive as China\u2019s technological surge has been, it is far from clear that the country will, as its government expects, become an AI superpower in the near term. For all the hype, China\u2019s AI industry is constrained at home by a shortage of talent, hardware and genuine innovation. And overseas, it is limited by its companies\u2019 close links with the state, which has fed suspicions about their motives and ethical positions.</p><p>\u201cPrivate AI companies in China leverage strategic support from the government to form a collaborative national organism of AI,\u201d said Vilas Dhar, a US-based venture investor and AI expert. \u201cThis integrated ecosystem makes them highly competitive, but also spurs scrutiny by the rest of the world.\u201d</p><p>State support</p><p>China\u2019s State Council laid out its ambitions in artificial intelligence in 2017, with a road map envisioning an industry worth Rmb1tn ($140bn-plus) by 2030. The Ministry of Science and Technology identified a \u201cnational team\u201d with a first group made up of internet giants <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Baidu-Inc4\"> Baidu</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Alibaba-Group-Holding\">Alibaba Group Holding</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/Tencent-Holdings-Ltd\">Tencent Holdings</url>, together with voice recognition intelligence company iFlytek, to lead the country's development of next-generation artificial intelligence technologies.</p><p>The announcement was sparse in detail about specific support for the companies, and the amount of money that would be made available. However, on a practical level, it seems to have meant that the government is willing to be the anchor client for major AI projects, creating a market for advanced applications of the technology.</p><p>The Ministry of Education drafted its own \u201cAI Innovation Action Plan for Colleges and Universities\u201d, calling for 50 world-class AI textbooks, 50 national-level online AI courses and 50 AI research centres to be established by 2020. By the first half of 2019, China had 35 college-level AI research centres. No data are available on how close the country is to achieving its other goals.</p><p>Across government, public servants were incentivised to bring AI into their work and to promote AI-related projects in their jurisdictions.</p><p>\u201cThe adoption rate of AI technology in the city has become an important measure in evaluating government officials\u2019 work,\u201d said Wang Lei, a professor at the College of Electronics and Information Engineering at Tongji University and expert in Chinese artificial intelligence development. \u201cExperience in leading AI-related works has become a must-have if you want to get promoted to a higher-level position.\u201d</p><p>Motivated by the prospect of promotion, local government officials are racing to put out more business-friendly policies and initiatives to attract related investments, according to Mr Wang.</p><p>But besides policy support and funding, the government also granted Chinese AI companies something else crucially valuable: data.</p><p>Data are the raw material for artificial intelligence. The larger and more comprehensive the data sets, the more effectively companies can train their algorithms. The Chinese government, which has access to enormous amounts of information collected on its citizens, has opened up the resource to its champion companies.</p><p>Few have benefited more than Ping An Technology, a subsidiary of the giant Ping An Insurance whose 2018 revenues totalled more than Rmb1tn. Since its foundation in 1988, the company has built an enormous consumer data set, and it spun out Ping An Tech in 2008 to leverage that using AI. Ping An Tech\u2019s activity now spans financial services, healthcare, automotive, real estate technology and smart cities.</p><p>In 2017, Ping An Tech entered into a collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Chongqing and Shenzhen. The authorities opened up a vast data set \u2014 20m health and medical records \u2014 to the private company, which used the data to train an artificial intelligence platform, dubbed PADIA, to predict outbreaks of disease. PADIA is now able to predict with 90 per cent accuracy the epidemic status of influenza, hand, foot, and mouth disease and the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p><p>The sheer scale of the data available to Ping An Tech gave it an advantage that few international companies could match. By contrast, in 2016, the UK's National Health Service signed a contract with Google-owned artificial intelligence company DeepMind, aiming to use AI-informed scans to detect eye disease with an accuracy on par with, or exceeding, human experts.</p><p>The project is currently stalled. DeepMind so far has access to only 1.6m health records provided by the NHS, which experts say is not enough to train an effective AI model. Moreover, the partnership has attracted controversies and lawsuits, with some patients denying that they gave consent for their data to be shared.</p><p>Ping An says that government agencies provided them with raw data that concealed all personal information, meaning the company only has access to a collective, anonymised data set where data points cannot be traced back to individuals.</p><p>\u201cThe machine learning process that trained the AI model is looking for patterns in the data, so individual personal information was really not needed,\u201d said Xu Liang, deputy chief engineer at Ping An Tech.</p><p>Mr Xu said the AI model is also used in Shenzhen to help local government agencies read and extract key information from documents, and can reduce processing time by 95 per cent. Several provinces in China are using it to detect social welfare fraud, and it has already detected instances of healthcare fraud, saving nearly Rmb1bn.</p><p>Having built a commanding presence at home, China's AI giants want to take their technology to other markets \u2014 and, in fact, they may need to. Government clients aside, the domestic market for AI is relatively limited in China.</p><p>Developing AI platforms is important, but commercialisation of AI is driven by actually devising use cases for the technology, said Varun Arora, partner in the digital transformation practice at consultancy AT Kearney. While the vast scale of the Chinese market means that there are consumer applications, the real money in AI in the near term will be in industrial and commercial settings.</p><p>\u201cOne big reason why use cases have not flourished in China, besides, of course, a few big ones, is because of cheap and quality labour in the country. Ultimately, AI business cases will be based on displacement of human capital, and the US is a more ripe market for that compared to China,\u201d Mr Arora said.</p><p>Facetime</p><p>Close relationships between AI companies and the Chinese government have allowed them to flourish, but the same co-operation has proved a massive detriment to their expansion into other markets. Governments, companies and consumers fear that giving Chinese AI companies access to data and systems is tantamount to handing them over directly to the Communist party.</p><p>\u201cThere is not really a distinct private sector in China,\u201d said Mr Dhar, the US venture investor. \u201cWhat is really happening in China is one very large set of people, data, algorithms that are moving fluidly between government and private companies.\u201d</p><p>This nervousness is particularly keen in the subsector where Chinese technology companies are probably furthest ahead of their international rivals: facial recognition.</p><p>Facial recognition has developed rapidly over the past decade or so, due to advances in so-called deep learning, which allows computers to more accurately read and interpret images. In China, public and private actors saw huge potential in the technology, from face-scan verification, used in place of biometrics or passwords, through to the police's desire to scan public spaces, such as airports and train stations. That market led to the development of at least four \u201cunicorns\u201d \u2014 private companies with valuations of more than $1bn \u2014 Megvii Technology, SenseTime, CloudWalk Technology and Yitu Technology.</p><p>From making payments at stores to going through airport customs, many tasks in China can now be easily done through face scans. On December 1, new rules came into effect in China requiring anyone who registers a new mobile phone number to submit to facial scans by their telecom carriers. Driven by the growing ubiquity of the technology, there have been more than 900 facial recognition patents filed in China \u2014 nearly 10 times more than the number of patents filed in the US according to data analytics company CB Insights. Chinese start-ups have dominated the US National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s rankings of facial-recognition accuracy, according to a report published in 2018.</p><p>Chinese tech companies are seeking to turn that technological dominance into international clout. The Financial Times recently reported that telecoms equipment maker <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/ZTE-Corp\"> ZTE</url>, security camera maker Dahua Technology and state-owned       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Companies/China-Telecom-Corp.-Ltd\">China Telecom</url> are among those proposing new global standards in the UN\u2019s International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for facial recognition, video monitoring and surveillance of cities and vehicles.</p><p>The biggest client for facial recognition technology in China has been the government, which has employed it in its defence and police establishments. That has meant that private companies have become entangled in highly controversial government policies, including police crackdowns on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and the incarceration of more than a million people from the Uighur minority in \u201cre-education\u201d camps in Xinjiang province.</p><p>Founded in 2011, Megvii alone has raised more than $1.3bn, primarily from Chinese investment funds and companies \u2014 including ecommerce giant Alibaba \u2014 and filed for an initial public offering in Hong Kong in August. While pitching to prospective investors in Hong Kong this past summer, the company touted its public security contracts with the Chinese government as a selling point.</p><p>That strategy rapidly backfired. In October, Megvii was put on a US trade blacklist over what Washington said was Beijing's treatment of Uighurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities. The US blacklisted a total of 28 Chinese public security bureaus and companies, including facial recognition start-ups SenseTime and Yitu, video surveillance specialist Hikvision and voice recognition giant iFlytek, all of which are trying to expand overseas to escape an increasingly saturated domestic market.</p><p>However, while Chinese cities have been rolling out facial recognition technologies, and other Asian nations have embraced Chinese technology to enable their security apparatuses, western governments have laboured over how to regulate the emerging sector, which has created a multitude of new civil liberty concerns.</p><p>In May, San Francisco became the first city in the US to ban the use of facial recognition technology by the city's municipal departments, including the police. In the UK, a citizen has taken a local police force to court in what could be a test case for the use of the technology. This speaks to a profound ideological gulf in the way that artificial intelligence will be developed and used.</p><p>\u201cA constitutional right we have [in the US] is innocent until proven guilty. Facial recognition could flip that idea around,\u201d said Mutale Nkonde, a Harvard fellow and AI policy adviser.</p><p>Ren Zhengfei, founder and CEO of Huawei Technologies, articulated the difference in views in a panel interview in September. \u201cI believe the protection of personal information should not come at the expense of public security,\u201d Mr Ren said. \u201cWestern societies have protected privacy at all costs, but the trade-off is its public safety. Just look at how many mass shootings have happened in the US. You can protect someone's privacy, but what about the safety of the others?\u201d</p><p>There are signs, however, that even in China citizens are becoming concerned about overuse of facial recognition. In November, the Southern Metropolis Daily reported that Guo Bing, a lecturer at Zhejiang Sci-tech University, was suing a local wildlife park for breach of contract, after it changed its biometric ticketing system to one using facial recognition. Mr Guo was reportedly alarmed that the system would increase the risk of identity theft, and asked for a refund, which the park refused to give him. It is the latest of a small but growing number of private actions against companies using the technology.</p><p>\u201cPeople in China are also getting increasingly concerned about the power companies have as they are collecting billions of people's biometric data every day,\u201d said Danny O\u2019Brien, strategy director of the non-profit Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p>In September, a new Chinese app, Zao, which lets users \u201cswap faces\u201d with celebrities \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 in video clips, drew millions of downloads immediately after launching. But it also quickly sparked debates over privacy issues, as its user agreement allows the company to store pictures taken and use them for profit. The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology met with company executives within a week of the app\u2019s launch, and asked the company to revise the agreement to require users\u2019 consent before using the images.</p><p>Cases like this show the progress China has made in protecting consumer data and privacy, according to Yi Zeng, head of AI ethics and safety at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He added that a stipulation on \u201cthe proper use of citizens\u2019 data\u201d was also written into China's national AI strategy.</p><p>However, while the Chinese private sector is under increasing pressure to be responsible with user data, citizens have few avenues to challenge the government's use of their personal information. According to articles 7 and 14 of the National Intelligence Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Chinese citizens are required to \u201csupport, assist and co-operate with the state intelligence work\u201d, which leaves enough leeway for the authorities to collect and use citizens\u2019 data without informed consent.</p><p>Fundamental flaws</p><p>The dramatic growth of China's AI sector, measured by the sheer number of patents that the country produces, masks the fact that, in terms of fundamental research, it is still lagging behind the US.</p><p>\u201cOne critical question left to answer for China is whether its AI ecosystem can produce big breakthroughs in fundamental AI research \u2014 the cornerstone of US structural advantages in this space,\u201d said Jeffrey Ding, China lead for the Governance of AI project at the University of Oxford\u2019s Future of Humanity Institute.</p><p>Earlier this year, the AI specialist Lux Research performed an analysis of highly cited researchers in scientific papers focusing on cutting-edge artificial intelligence. They found that out of 2,100 highly cited researchers, only 158 came from Chinese research entities. Of those, just 37 came from the private sector.</p><p>This deficiency is in a large part down to the industry\u2019s structure. American AI development is market-driven and dominated by independent, private sector players. Their need to focus on commercially viable applications has meant that US companies have taken leads in more industrial and business-process AI, including in autonomous vehicles.</p><p>By contrast, China\u2019s approach is centralised and top down. While that has helped the sector to focus on specialist areas and created a market for them, it may also be stifling innovation. \u201cThe openness of the US technology ecosystem \u2014 to new ideas, new people and new debates about AI ethics \u2014 provides the bedrock for its AI advantage,\u201d Mr Ding said.</p><p>The US also has an advantage in hardware: most of the cutting-edge chips being used in fundamental AI research are designed in America, and some are already finding their way on to lists of restricted technology exports.</p><p>\u201cThe US is still way ahead of us in artificial intelligence in terms of research,\u201d said Mr Xu at Ping An Tech. \u201cChina needs time and talents to catch up, and it\u2019s critical to catch up before our development of AI [is] limited by fundamental infrastructures such as computing powers.\u201d</p><p>That said, the lack of a collective goal and a unifying strategy in the US could ultimately hamper the sector, as the technology becomes more mature \u2014 and, while the private sector-led approach may, on a superficial level, appear less open to abuse than one backed by the security apparatus, it is not without risks.

While Big Tech bears the brunt of it all.   To that end,  The Wall Street Journal reported  Monday (Sept. 21) that leadership within China has \u201csped up development\u201d of a list of U.S. firms that could conceivably be targeted for punishment amid the escalating spat that has focused on technology, data privacy and security.   Yet some individuals within China\u2019s leadership ranks are hesitant to finalize the list, or to act upon it, until after the U.S. election in November.   The blacklist itself is nothing new, with a May 2019 announcement having come from China that would have generated such a roster of companies and individuals. But back then, the U.S. and China delved into trade negotiations that ultimately led to a partial trade agreement .   Now, Chinese agencies spanning the Commerce Ministry, the Cybersecurity Administration and other regulators have been asked to submit names for the Chinese blacklist, the Journal reported, citing unnamed people \u201cfamiliar with them matter.\u201d   So much hinges, now, on what happens \u2014 or won\u2019t happen \u2014 with TikTok and WeChat. As has been widely reported, Oracle is gunning to grab a 12.5 percent stake in TikTok, Walmart for a 7.5 percent stake in TikTok Global. For now the bans that loomed for TikTok and WeChat may have been sidestepped.   The cross-border dance that is going on in Washington, D.C. and Beijing is one that looks at supply chain relationships. And one firm that has reportedly made the list for all the Chinese regulators has been Cisco, which has been losing at least some contracts with Chinese telecom players.   The Chinese list, as we noted is not public. But we would contend that there exists some low-hanging fruit that would be at the proverbial top of that list. Apple comes in near the top, of course. China accounted for roughly $9 billion in  sales for the latest quarter  (about 15 percent of the tally). The continued push by payments network giants such as Mastercard may see a chilling effect.   As reported earlier this month, China\u2019s  central bank gave Mastercard permission to set up a bank card clearing business, granting access to a $27 trillion payments market (right when retail spending in the nation is just beginning to rebound from a long slump amid the pandemic ).   The central bank said Mastercard and its partner, NetsUnion Clearing Corp., have to complete all preparation work within 12 months (which would take us into early 2021). And as PYMNTS reported earlier in the year, as part of China\u2019s trade deal with the U.S. (that phase one pact), Chinese regulators said applications from providers of electronic-payments services would be considered within 90 days. Visa\u2019s own efforts in China have also focused on the process of getting a bank card clearing license.   There have been reports that, per the Commerce Ministry, the unreliable entity list will not target a specific country or entity, as CNBC said . But tariffs levied, across several players within a certain vertical, or contracts that are cancelled, can have the same net (negative) effect.   \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014    LIVE PYMNTS TV OCTOBER SERIES: POWERING THE DIGITAL SHIFT \u2013 B2B PAYMENTS 2021      Banks, corporates and even regulators now recognize the imperative to modernize \u2014 not just digitize \u2014the infrastructures and workflows that move money and data between businesses domestically and cross-border.

Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, has a bachelor of arts degree in public policy from Princeton University. He graduated from Harvard Law School. He has worked as a successful litigator. At some point along the way, Cruz learned how to decide which ideas are baseless.</p><p><br/>Like many loud voices in his party, Cruz has suspended that habit of evidentiary discrimination in recent years. Earlier this month, he and a fellow Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-15/cruz-hawley-want-the-ftc-to-probe-social-media-content-curation\">urged the Federal Trade Commission</url>to investigate Twitter, Facebook, and Google for alleged anti-conservative bias in content-moderation practices and the ways algorithms prioritize some types of content over others.<br/>At       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOwKeNRWTWE\">congressional hearing</url> after congressional hearing,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trumps-very-big-very-important-social-media-summit\">Donald Trump</url>speech after Donald Trump interview, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/26/tucker_carlson_google_wants_to_hack_2020_election.html\">Fox News talk show</url> after       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://video.foxbusiness.com/v/6052492769001/#sp=show-clips\">Fox News talk show</url>, we have heard a steady, coordinated chorus of complaints about conservative bias on these platforms. As serious policy makers wrestle with the complex challenges that Big Tech poses-in areas such as disinformation, Russian propaganda, antitrust, and privacy-Cruz, Hawley, and others on the right keep insinuating that platforms are somehow suppressing conservative views.<br/>There is no evidence for these accusations. There are no legitimate studies supporting these contentions. There is no documentation of company officials ordering up anti-conservative bias or policies.<br/>But to say there is no evidence for these accusations is too weak. These complaints are just false. Coming from smart people who know better-smart people like Cruz, the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/11/senator-ted-cruz-president-campaign-facebook-user-data\">first U.S. presidential candidate to hire Cambridge Analytica</url> and try to use its trove of personal Facebook data on millions of Americans-this looks like an intentionally duplicitous move.<br/>Cruz knows that conservatives need Facebook and Google and that they benefit greatly from the algorithmic amplification that occurs in both systems. Trump's 2020 campaign manager is Brad Parscale, who ran digital operations for the president's successful 2016 campaign. Parscale       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/facebook-won-trump-election-not-just-fake-news/\">declared that his mastery of Facebook</url> for advertising, amplifying pro-Trump videos and memes, and fundraising won the 2016 election.<br/>Scholarship supports this conclusion. As the sociologist Jen Schradie demonstrates in great detail in her new book,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674972339\">The Revolution That Wasn't: How Digital Activism Favors Conservatives</url>, Facebook and Google work better for top-down, well-funded, disciplined, directed movements. Those adjectives tend to describe conservative groups more than liberal or leftist groups in the United States. In our current media ecosystem, right-wing sources of news and propaganda spread much further and faster than liberal or neutral sources do,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HuQ9OyQDbiiXPrzCuotH_arbQ3bPXi7W9ibNjOWmkBw/edit?ts=5d379119\">according to a rigorous quantitative study of communication-network patterns</url> by Yochai Benkler, Robert Faris, and Hal Roberts at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet &amp;amp; Society. Internet platforms are demonstrably not silencing conservative ideas. If anything, the opposite is true.<br/>No algorithm is neutral. Facebook and Google are biased, but in a way that has nothing to do with American political ideologies or parties. Instead, both of these global systems favor content that generates strong emotional reactions from users-clicks, shares, likes, and comments. There is a clear commercial reason for this design choice. It keeps users hooked, ready to click on more advertisements and thus generate more revenue for the platform.<br/>The media scholar Zeynep Tufekci has explained how YouTube's recommendation engine       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/youtubes-recommendation-algorithm-has-a-dark-side/\">sends viewers down rabbit holes of extremism</url> because passive people like to be prodded to feel something, whether that's anger, humor, joy, fear, or hatred. And       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520258822/the-googlization-of-everything\">I have described all the ways Google</url> and Facebook move users (and users move Google and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/antisocial-media-9780190841164?cc=us&amp;amp;lang=en&amp;amp;\">Facebook</url>) to anger us, divide us, distract us, and undermine our ability to function as citizens of a democratic republic.<br/>In short, Facebook is a remarkable tool for motivation. It's a terrible platform for deliberation. Democratic citizenship demands both motivation of the like-minded and deliberation among those with different ideas and agendas. And       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520258822/the-googlization-of-everything\">Google is a terrible tool for discerning truth from falsity</url>. Google is worse at discerning relevant information from trivia. It's not a good source to achieve depth of understanding about a diverse and changing world.<br/>We have trained the algorithms to feed us more extreme content every time. The algorithms are designed to work that way. We change YouTube and Facebook, so YouTube and Facebook change us-and not for the better.<br/>Many conservatives are hip to these criticisms. \"Big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter exercise enormous influence on speech,\" Hawley and Cruz wrote in       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-07/2019-07-15_FTC-Letter-Content-Moderation-Practices.pdf\">a letter to the FTC</url>. \"The vast majority of internet traffic flows through just a handful of these companies. They control the ads we see, the news we read, and the information we digest. And they actively censor some content and amplify other content based on algorithms and intentional decisions that are completely nontransparent.\" I could not have described the situation more clearly.<br/>Yet rather than helping to forge a careful policy response, these two senators-and others on the right-leap from a description of a real set of problems to a mythical one. How and why do they mask the clear conclusions that Google and Facebook have helped mold the environment that gave us Donald Trump? The campaign to label these platforms \"anti-conservative\" does two main things.<br/>First, conservatives are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/what-liberal-media/\">working the refs</url>. If conservatives put media executives on their heels, constantly defending themselves or excusing themselves or apologizing for misunderstandings, then these companies are likely to bend toward conservatives out of fear or just exhaustion. This strategy has succeeded before. The liberal-media critic Eric Alterman       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eric-alterman/what-liberal-media/9780786740932/\">has argued that</url> such campaigns in the 1990s and early 2000s resulted in mainstream outlets such as The New York Times pushing unjustified right-wing causes like the Whitewater investigation and the invasion of Iraq.<br/>Working the refs is still effective.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/04/why-mark-zuckerberg-is-cozying-up-to-conservatives\">Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/trump-meets-with-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-white-house/?utm_term=.2c262e53fd3e\">Jack Dorsey of Twitter</url> are not wise enough to understand what's happening. So both Facebook and Twitter have allowed themselves to be worked. Platforms do make some intentional decisions to moderate the content that appears on their websites. But Facebook, Twitter, and Google staff try to do so based on principles and standards that they agonize over. Calls to violence or gender-based harassment should not be considered expressions of political ideology. More often than not, these companies under-filter hate speech because they have such strong concern for free speech. Far from rushing to suspend even conspiracy slingers and hate-mongers such as Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos, executives at Facebook and Twitter       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-bans-alex-jones-extremists/\">hemmed and hawed for years about whether to enforce their own terms of service</url>.<br/>Surely Cruz and Hawley don't mean to make Alex Jones's cause their cause, right? If they did, they'd be equating American conservatism with ethno-nationalist trolling and loony fantasies such as Pizzagate.<br/>The campaign to convince people that the problem with Facebook and Google is that they lean left has a second, more dangerous effect. Fundamentally, it undermines seriousness-that is, it makes any productive discussion impossible.<br/>Deep, measured, scholarly critiques of the most powerful elements of our information ecosystem get drowned out when Cruz, Hawley, or Trump crows about bias. That's an easy talking point for politicians to push, an easy story for distractible news organizations to report, and an easy idea for a gullible public to digest. The concept that billions of aggregated human decisions mold the actions of complex machine-learning systems-which in turn guide human behavior, ultimately rendering us shallow, exhausted, angered, and willing to believe just about anything-is not such a pithy story.<br/>Cruz and Hawley have to know perfectly well they can't legislate or regulate the editorial choices that private companies make in America. And they are not making serious proposals, nor introducing any evidence for their complaints.<br/>That is the real story of Facebook and Google and their effects on our collective minds. We have been rendered unable to take serious things seriously. One reason we can't face that horrible conclusion is that-well, we can't take serious things seriously. Cruz, Hawley, and Trump benefit greatly from that vicious circle in the short term, but democracy and the pursuit of a decent society suffer greatly over time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-conservativespretendbigtechbiasedagainstthem594916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WPD-W5C1-DYY9-J2D6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

In Singapore, the typical consultation papers circulated to stakeholders in the financial sector for their feedback are issued by either Singapore's central bank, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), or Singapore Exchange Regulation (SGX RegCo).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And organisations and individuals do respond to them to further their own interests. Which is understandable. But our first instinct as investment professionals when asked to share our input with policymakers is often to ignore the request.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Admittedly, I've been guilty of this myself. Nevertheless, I responded to a few of these papers and that prompted me to wonder: Why should anybody give their views and feedback on these lengthy not-so-easy-to-comprehend documents? Aren't we sticking our necks out? Wouldn't our time and resources be better deployed elsewhere? Wouldn't we rather go bouldering or trail running, catch up on sleep, or simply do nothing'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, this is why we do it.</p><p>Investor protection over commercial interests</p><p>That investors supply funds is a point we tend to forget. These funds are generated mostly through hard-earned savings. If there are no funds to manage or to be aggregated to fund development projects or loans, then a central component of the financial sector will cease to function and the conduit between the fund suppliers and end users is effectively broken.</p><p>And that means investors may not achieve such goals as retirement accumulation. That's a rather important and crucial point for us in Singapore where one in four or five people will be over 65 in 2030.</p><p>Moreover, at the macro level, without thriving capital markets, economic growth will be slower. This has implications for our standards of living and efforts to lift people out of poverty, especially in developing countries. It also inhibits our efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy and prevent ecological catastrophe.</p><p>Therefore, all investors must be protected, especially the most vulnerable - less experienced retail investors. When these retail investors encounter well-funded companies staffed by professionals, a typical David and Goliath situation develops. The Goliath Adam Smith company is for profit: Commercial interests are paramount. And often, those commercial interests come at the expense of the investors.</p><p>In this respect, investor protection should come before commercial interests because investors play the central role in channelling funds towards productive investments. Over the long term, protecting investors ensures the long-term development of the capital markets and our profession.</p><p>A case in point: Global stock exchanges want to attract and host the next big tech unicorn that may one day join the ranks of BAT - Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent - and FANG stocks. The big carrot they dangle? Dual-class shares. These give their holders an iron grip on the company through disproportionate voting rights even when they aren't majority shareholders. There are good reasons for such structures. But there are also pitfalls.</p><p>SGX requested feedback through a consultation paper in early 2017. Our community carefully weighed the pros and cons of the proposal and decided to stand firm on \"one-share, one-vote\". Why? Because we believe it is the most optimal market practice that best protects investors.</p><p>Another case in point: During one consultation paper process, a regulator contacted us as part of the clarification phase and told us we were probably the only organisation that considered the retail investor's interest in our response. Our immediate reaction was to pat ourselves on the back: \"What a noble job we're doing.\"</p><p>But our afterthought was far less sanguine: Why were we the only party concerned about retail investors? After all, they account for a not-insignificant portion of the funds in SGX-listed companies. Should they look into safeguarding their own interests? Perhaps this is an argument for embracing the Stewardship Principles in Singapore under which investors engage the investee companies in a more meaningful way and help protect and steer their own investments.</p><p>Transparent corporate reporting</p><p>Most investors demand transparent corporate reporting. Fundamental analysis requires accurate, thorough, pertinent, and timely information to assess returns and risks. Which is why we should advocate for research, commentary, and policies that advance reporting transparency.</p><p>That means embracing policies that enhance disclosure requirements. Investors should have a better view into how listed companies arrive at their decisions, whether they apply to mergers, acquisitions, spinoffs, real estate, or whatever else. Data on valuation methodology and the assumptions underpinning the valuation, not to mention on the independence of the valuers and interested party transactions should be available as well.</p><p>Transparency improves corporate governance practices. Of course, environmental issues - the \"E\" in ESG - have come to the fore in Singapore after a rather warm 2019 and the realisation that drastic measures may be required to protect our island nation from rising tides. Nevertheless, many of us in finance believe that the \"G\" (governance), is just as, if not more, important. Indeed, governance issues may outweigh environmental and social issues when it comes to the impact on share prices, corporate bond yields/spreads, and sovereign debt yields.</p><p>Anecdotal evidence backs this up. Very often we hear complaints from hedge funds about the state of corporate governance in Asia. \"It just doesn't exist,\" one analyst told us.</p><p>\"We'd rather invest in European companies, which have stronger governance. At least we know the company has sound practices and believable numbers.\"</p><p>So whenever a consultation paper requests feedback on a transparency issue, our response should be an easy one: The more transparency the better.</p><p>Financial market fairness for ALL investors</p><p>Why do we value fairness? Because we have all been treated unfairly at some point in our lives. And we all know how it feels. Fair and equitable treatment and the perception of it is essential to ensure market broad participation. That holds true whether the investor is high net worth or a young worker with a little surplus income from their first full-time stint in the labour force.</p><p>What are the consequences of an unfair financial market or one that is perceived as such? Well, mistrustful investors won't invest as much if they don't think they're getting a fair shot compared to the more wealthy or connected. For example, private placements to family offices may be advantageous to the issuer, fund manager, and high net worth individuals - a win-win-win situation.</p><p>For other retail investors, it may be a case of win-lose: They will question whether the issuer could have given them the right of first refusal. Perhaps the issuers could have. Or maybe they couldn't because the funds had to be raised in a hurry. Reits, for example, do need to compete with family offices to bid for real estate acquisitions and time is of the essence when drawing the capital together. Private placements expedite the process. Raising funds from existing shareholders slows it down. Reits will prefer the former.</p><p>Regulators and listcos must balance out such competing objectives. An expedient move may be perceived poorly in some quarters, so it has to be managed carefully.</p><p>If it isn't, the perception of an unlevel playing field can take hold, and when it does, it can be a very difficult to change. And as a result, volumes may go south, along with valuations of listed stocks. And lower valuation will prompt listcos to delist, only to relist in another bourse. And then the yet-to-be-listed firms will take their IPO exercise to another exchange with higher liquidity. Which is not a scenario we want.</p><p>Investment industry professionalism</p><p>This applies to those who staff the sector. And the people really do make the sector. Professionalism comes from competency in performing our duties. And competency comes from knowledge acquisition, application, and experience.</p><p>Professionalism requires us to put clients' interest first and thus demonstrate and live the fiduciary mindset. Why is this so important? Because professionalism creates trust in the profession and respect for professionals within the sector. And that is the foundation of the continued growth of the capital markets and the economy.</p><p>In the wake of the global financial crisis (GFC), trust in the financial sector was at an all-time low across the globe. Relationship managers and private bankers got an earful. The chorus grew louder with the Occupy Wall Street movement.</p><p>Naturally, lawmakers, regulators, and industry experts were worried. And with good reason. A broken and trust-deprived financial system means slower economic growth. Trust had to be regained. Laws, best practices, and regulatory standards - viable solutions - had to be put in place to shore up trust.</p><p>That trust-building process is ongoing. And investors, the public, and organisations must participate.</p><p>And responding to consultation papers is one way we can help shape the views and policies of regulators. Not all perspectives will necessarily be integrated into the final regulations, but all segments of society should have their say.</p><p>How can you contribute'</p><p>The short answer? Respond to consultation papers - either as an individual or an organisation. The long answer'</p><p>Advocate for ethical markets in as many channels as possible.</p><p>Yes, respond to consultation papers, but also speak up for ethics, trust, and professional standards. Support fair and transparent financial markets and practices. Protect the interests of investors. Be an advocate. And effective advocacy today comes down to three core principles:</p><p>Financial markets must be both equitable and free. Every investor should have the opportunity to generate a fair return.The most important market participant is the end investor. Their interests must come before those of all others.Individual ethics and self-regulation are as critical to the fair and efficient operation of the markets as standards and regulations.When we're committed to professional ethics, it becomes much easier to understand the issues and the perspectives and communicate to regulators in a coherent and consistent manner.</p><p>Chan Fook Leong, CFA, is the executive director, Advocacy, at CFA Society Singapore.

Continue reading Why countries keep bowing to Apple and Google s contact tracing app requirements</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month, after Apple and Google announced some changes to their forthcoming attempt to track the spread of COVID-19, I noted the surprising degree to which tech giants are setting the terms of the pandemic response. They own the hardware, they own the software, and national governments who would use it to find new cases of COVID-19 have to do it on the companies  terms.</p><p>This week, that process began to accelerate. But first, a bit of background.</p><p>The Apple-Google collaboration will ask you to opt in to a system that causes your phone to emit Bluetooth signals to other phones around you. When you are in close proximity to another person for an extended period of time   more than five minutes, typically   both of your phones record the interaction. When a person tests positive for COVID-19, they will have the option of anonymously notifying other phones that they may have been exposed to the virus and encouraging their contacts to self-quarantine or seek treatment.</p><p>A sticking point between the tech giants and nation states has been who will process the exposure notifications. Apple and Google want to process the notifications on users  phones without storing them on a central server, to preserve the maximum degree of privacy possible. Some European countries, meanwhile, have sought to process notifications on a central server, in the hopes that having more detailed information will help them identify additional exposures and more rapidly contain the spread of the virus. (MIT Tech Review has a great tracker that looks at how countries are building these apps, including whether or not they ve adopted the Apple-Google approach.)</p><p>This put France, whose politicians have regularly upbraided Silicon Valley for perceived data privacy lapses, in the very funny position of begging Apple and Google to lower their privacy standards. Germany, whose scientists had helped devise Europe s (deep breath) proposed Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing project, decided to throw in with Apple and Google after it became clear that was not going to happen.</p><p>Until now, England has held holding firm in its commitment to building its own exposure notification app, even though it will have limited access to the Bluetooth notifications necessary for it to work. James Vincent explained why this is a problem this week at The Verge:</p><p>Both Google and Apple restrict how apps can use Bluetooth in iOS and Android. They don t allow developers to constantly broadcast Bluetooth signals, as that sort of background broadcast has been exploited in the past for targeted advertising. As The Register reports, iOS apps can only send Bluetooth signals when the app is running in the foreground. If your iPhone is locked or you re not looking at the app, then there s no signal. The latest versions of Android have similar restrictions, only allowing Bluetooth signals to be sent out for a few minutes after an app has closed. Such restrictions will block devices from pinging one another in close quarters, drastically reducing the effectiveness of any contact-tracing app.</p><p>Google and Apple can rewrite these rules for their own contact-tracing API because they control the operating systems. But for countries trying to go it alone, like the UK, the restrictions could literally be fatal. iPhone users with the app installed could interact with someone who is later diagnosed with COVID-19 and never know it, if their phone doesn t keep a log of their interaction.</p><p>Now it seems that all of this has dawned on England s National Health Service, which has asked the consulting firm charged with building its app to investigate switching over to the Apple-Google model. Here are Alex Hern and Kate Proctor today in the Guardian:</p><p>With growing questions over that approach, it emerged that the Swiss-based consultancy Z\u00fchlke Engineering has been hired to undertake a two-week  technical spike  to investigate implementing Apple and Google s system  within the existing proximity mobile application and platform . [ ]</p><p>The prime minister s official spokesman left open the possibility that a change could be made, telling reporters:  We ve set out our plans for a centralised model and that s what we are taking forwards but we will keep all options under review to make sure the app is as effective as possible. </p><p>Right now, it s unclear how an app that only works when every citizen in England has the app downloaded, open, and running in the foreground at all times is going to be  as effective as possible.  As of today, I d be surprised if England hadn t adopted the Apple-Google approach by the end of this month.</p><p>It s a fascinating tension: corporations trying to do right by their users versus countries trying to do right by their citizens. As Sam Lessin notes in The Information, this is an uncomfortable place for a tech giant to be.  This isn t an enviable position for tech companies,  he writes.  It puts them in a nearly impossible position in terms of almost always absorbing blame no matter what they do whenever the choices are hard. </p><p>Elsewhere, India is learning that the privacy concerns around exposure notification apps and contact tracing are not merely abstract. Aarogya Setu, the country s own homegrown exposure notification app, has significant privacy flaws, Andy Greenberg reported this week at Wired:</p><p>Independent security researcher Baptiste Robert published a blog post today sounding that warning about India s Health Bridge app, or Aarogya Setu, created by the government s National Informatics Centre. Robert found that one feature of the app, designed to let users check if there are infected people nearby, instead allows users to spoof their GPS location and learn how many people reported themselves as infected within any 500-meter radius. In areas that have relatively sparse reports of infections, Robert says hackers could even use a so-called triangulation attack to confirm the diagnosis of someone they suspect to be positive.</p><p> The developers of this app didn t think that someone malicious would be able to intercept its requests and modify them to get information on a specific area,  says Robert, a French researcher known in part for finding security vulnerabilities in the Indian national ID system known as Aadhaar.  With triangulation, you can very closely see who is sick and who is not sick. They honestly didn t consider this use of the app. </p><p>On one hand, privacy has never been the prime directive for a contact tracing scheme. The whole point is to find out people s real names, phone numbers, and locations so you can tell them that they re sick before they infect anyone else. At the same time, tech giants are understandably wary of building a tool that could be misused by law enforcement, oppressive governments, or the sorts of bad actors that Robert describes in India. For the moment, it s the giants  argument that has carried the day   and done so, at least for now, with remarkably little resistance.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis>announced it s giving $10 million to COPAN Diagnostics, a company that produces COVID-19 testing kits.

And with strategic planning sessions about to begin at CUs nationwide, many experts say institutions on both sides of the transaction - those merging and being acquired - should be discussing the topic as part of their planning sessions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CUNA Mutual Group'sCredit Union Trends Report for May 2019- the most recent data available - shows 5,550 active credit unions in the country today, a decline of 172 from one year prior. Data from the National Credit Union Administration shows a decline in the number of mergers each year since 2014, but the number of active CUs is also slowing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mark Sievewright, founder and CEO of the Sievewright and Associates consultancy, said he \"very much\" expects the consolidation trend to continue and possibly accelerate slightly. He recalled making a prediction a decade ago that there would be fewer than 5,000 credit unions in the U.S. by the end of 2020.</p><p>\"My latest point of view is we are likely to have less than 3,000 credit unions by the end of 2030,\" he said. \"The drive for scale in our movement is palpable right now, and I have a fundamental belief that the definition of what \"~scale' means is changing as credit unions must invest to keep up with advancements in technology.\"</p><p>Sievewright noted it was not that long ago a credit union with $500 million in assets was considered large. As a sign of change, he pointed to the proposed merger of BB&amp;T and SunTrust to create Truist Financial, a dealpartly drivenby the ongoing need for big tech investments at institutions of all sizes.</p><p>\"For credit unions, the new definition of \"~scale' has moved further along the asset spectrum and is heading toward $5 billion in assets, which is where I think it will be 10 years from now,\" he assessed. \"I believe we will see more mergers between larger credit unions, not just smaller credit unions merging into their larger counterparts. Also, I believe more credit unions will ask to expand across state lines to create scale.\"</p><p>Vincent Hui, managing director for Cornerstone Advisors, said there are two separate issues to consider: mergers of two credit unions and CU acquisitions of banks. The latter has proven to be one of the industry's biggest trends for 2019, with the number of deals announced so far this year already exceeding last year.</p><p>\"The number of mergers might stay the same or even decrease, but the average size of the merger will increase,\" he predicted, noting average CU sizes have grown over the last 10 years.</p><p>Hui said that unless regulators or lawmakers find a reason to stop it, the number of CUs buying banks is likely to increase over the next 24 months. \"Generally speaking an acquisition is easier, because credit union mergers have a lot of emotion, while bank acquisitions have less emotion. The bank sellers are simply looking for the best price. In a credit union merger, one credit union is not going to survive. Often the non-surviving credit union, especially its board, views a merger as a failure.\"</p><p>One possible solution is having multiple CU brands under one name, Hui said. He noted some mergers have resulted in credit unions operating as \"a division of\" the acquiring institution.</p><p>\"This helps people overcome emotional humps, and it is less disruptive for members,\" said Hui. \"The members might not care as much as management or the board, but it still helps.\"</p><p>VyStar CEO: Don't rule out organic growth</p><p>Brian Wolfburg, president and CEO of VyStar Credit Union, an $8.6 billion-asset institution headquartered in Jacksonville, Fla., has overseen three moves in the last year to grow the CU: it added 27 Florida counties to its field of membership, then itpurchased Citizens State Bankin Perry, Fla., and early in 2019 it announced plans tocross the state line into four countiesin southeast Georgia.</p><p>According to Wolfburg, CUs should look at merger and acquisition discussions during strategic planning time as part of their overall growth strategy talk. He said there are two ways to grow: organic growth or M&amp;A, and both need to be \"interwoven\" into the strategy for the organization.</p><p>\"Evaluate the organization as it is, focus on process improvements, and have the right products and services,\" he counseled. \"Once you have everything in place, look for ways to grow. We have chosen to pursue both organic and M&amp;A.\"</p><p>The first consideration is whether a merger or acquisition is the \"right approach\" for the organization, Wolfburg said, adding not every merger or an acquisition is the \"right\" move. Second, he said boards and management teams need to decide if their CU will be an acquirer or the acquired.</p><p>\"If you are going to be the acquired, you are trying to fix issues that you cannot solve by going alone,\" he said. \"If you are the acquirer, you are trying to speed up your growth by bringing in assets or new markets. But don't pursue a merger just because everyone else is doing it. Once you decide to do a merger, it has to be for the right reasons. Getting bigger for the sake of getting bigger is not the goal.\"</p><p>Be ready before opportunity knocksHui emphasized the importance of starting conversations on the topic now since mergers can take so long.</p><p>\"I have had several credit union CEOs tell me the return on time concept scares them off from pursuing a merger,\" he reported. \"It can take two years of conversations, and then the merger gets called off. There are a lot of conversations going on all the time, but conversations do not always mean mergers happen.\"</p><p>VyStar's Wolfburg said merger opportunities require a CU to move \"very quickly.\" He said credit unions have to know within a couple of weeks if they are going to move forward.</p><p>\"As a CEO, you don't want to go to the board or the senior management team when you hear about an opportunity. The discussion of \"~Should we merge?' needs to be done before the opportunity presents itself,\" he said. \"Future mergers should be incorporated into the business plan.\"</p><p>Asking the right questions</p><p>Hui said the strategic discussions regarding mergers must recognize that the institution will be markedly different once the process is complete.</p><p>\"Traditionally, mergers were done to achieve three goals: one, financial flexibility through scale, second, building richer capabilities, and third, expanding the field of membership. As credit unions are becoming larger, what is important is not how they structure the deal, but how they structure the credit union after the deal. As it has a larger geographic footprint, or is expanding across state lines, what worked before does not work anymore.\"</p><p>VyStar's Wolfburg suggested every board member should be evaluating the strategic fit of a partnership and the value it brings the organization, along with any risk. He said board and management teams need to know if the CU is the winning bidder on a merger the succeeding steps will require a commitment by the entire organization.</p><p>The road to a merger starts with establishing steering committees and working committees, and includes working with vendors, working with regulators, going through lists of hundreds of items long, making sure employees are comfortable, making announcements to members, and much more.</p><p>More than just getting through one merger, Wolfburg said CUs should be creating a repeatable process.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRUJNL-0000016c0c2bd789a17dcd3f927d00001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRUJNL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WMX-3211-JCRW-552V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">305422</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1257\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SourceMedia LLC d/b/a Arizent All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>creditunionjournal.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 1</volume><issueNumber>No. 1</issueNumber><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/why-credit-unions-must-plan-for-mergers-that-arent-on-the-horizon-yet\">https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/why-credit-unions-must-plan-for-mergers-that-arent-on-the-horizon-yet</url><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 23, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC0001VR7</classCode><className>CMFG LIFE INSURANCE CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS524298 ALL OTHER INSURANCE RELATED ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS523999 MISCELLANEOUS FINANCIAL INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>SIC6411 INSURANCE AGENTS, BROKERS, &amp;

Gillis was one of three new cast members announced this month. That includes the groundbreaking announcement that one of the new hires would be the first Chinese-American cast member, Bowen Yang.</p><p>But in the five days from the first tweet alerting producers of SNL to the time Gillis was let go, I couldn't help wonder: How fast would he have been fired if he said the N-word? And why the double standard?</p><p>Imagine if \"Saturday Night Live\" had just hired their first Black American comic and Gillis was caught saying \"f--king n---ers\" on tape, would there be any doubt he would out the door?</p><p>Admittedly, writing this after the revelation that the Canadian Prime Minister wore blackface seems almost quaint. Not to excuse the cringeworthy cluelessness of Justin Trudeau, but Gillis aired his podcast in 2018 when the world was, hopefully, a little more woke.</p><p>But my issue isn't with the firing of Gillis. It's what happened after. Gillis posted a statement saying, \"I understood it would be too much of a distraction,\" after the firing, which was not exactly an act of contrition. Before that he said in a nonapology apology that he would offer an apology to \"anyone who's actually offended\" by anything he said.</p><p>In the wake of the firing, the defenders came running to the door.</p><p>Former \"SNL\" cast member Rob Schneider posted: \"I am sorry you had the misfortune of being a cast member during this era of cultural unforgiveness.\"</p><p>Canadian comic Norm Macdonald said in a pinned Tweet that the firing was \"unacceptable\" and \"This means war.\"</p><p>And someone who should know better, CNN's Don Lemon, while acknowledging Gillis was being offensive, weighed in with: \"I really hate cancel culture and boycott culture ... everyone says stupid things, everyone does something that's boneheaded. We have to be more forgiving.\"</p><p>Sure, but what if Gillis had said the N-word? Comparing racial slurs - pitting the legacy of injustice to different racial groups against each other, whether it was slavery in the U.S. or a head tax in Canada - is not the answer. But one thing is clear: both words hurt. And they're the worst thing you can say about either race. So what gives?</p><p>Professor Lorne Foster, director at York University's Institute for Social Research, offers some context: \"The United States has a unique dialectic\" between Black and white, he says. \"Because of the legacy of slavery, other marginalized groups are not part of that Black and white narrative and often their issues go unnoticed so they get shut out of the conversation.\"</p><p>Asians, certainly of an earlier generation, are also used to turning the other cheek - valuing, like my parents, harmony not dissonance, even if it meant personal sacrifice.</p><p>\"Asians are still punching bags, largely because we don't speak out and we are perceived as doing well, which becomes part of the model-minority myth,\" says Dora Nip, CEO of the Multicultural History Society of Ontario.</p><p>Maybe it's also because as a community we've been disappointed so often.</p><p>I had so much hope during the 2016 #OscarsSoWhite Academy Award telecast. Chris Rock rightly mocked the audience for the lack of diversity. And then, he proceeded to bring out Asian child actors to make Asian accountant jokes. And who can forget in 2012 an ESPN employee wrote the headline \"Chink in the Armor\" to refer to American basketball player Jeremy Lin.</p><p>You would think Gillis would have learned some lessons from 2001 - the same year Trudeau was pictured at a high school wearing brownface - when comic Sarah Silverman appeared on \"Late Night With Conan O'Brien\" using the C-word, which censors didn't see fit to bleep out. It just wasn't on their radar. Silverman later defended her decision as \"satire\" and declared it was \"inappropriate to demand an apology.\"</p><p>In a head-shaking debate with an irate Silverman on \"Politically Incorrect\" with Bill Maher, civil-rights activist Guy Aoki had to remind the comic that \"calling a Chinese person a ch--k is the same as calling a Black person a n---er.\"</p><p>So what's the answer to all this? A little education can't hurt. I tell my journalist friends: when in doubt, just substitute \"Jew\" or \"Black\" into a sentence they think might be controversial.</p><p>A few years back Maclean's magazine reported that there were problems at the University of Toronto because some students thought there were too many Asian students. They wrapped the story with the headline \"Too Asian?\" This gem somehow passed the editors. But try substituting the words Jewish or Black and watch their eyes widen. Because yes, Asians are people too.</p><p>The upside to all this is that Bowen Yang, who is also part of the LGBTQ community, doesn't have to answer questions for the rest of the season about ch--k jokes and Gillis, whose real crime is that he's not funny.</p><p>Yang will be just another member of \"SNL\" - reflecting part of the diversity that's right out there on the streets of New York.

While there is still technically an opportunity for the bill to advance, it is not expected to be discussed again this session, said Alex Alben, the state's chief privacy officer.</p><p>The bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, took to social media Thursday, saying that he was committed to seeing legislation passed next year.</p><p>\"We built alignment that well-crafted, strong #dataprivacy is imperative to consumers and society. Unfortunately, House failed to pass privacy legislation this year. We're committed to 2020,\" Carlyle tweeted.</p><p>Why the bill failed is a matter of who you ask. Proponents of the bill have said it was purely a matter of the House and Senate not being able to get on the same page, while privacy rights activists have laid blame for the irresolution on the tech industry and its resistance to certain consumer protections that some legislators wanted to include.</p><p>Lack of Consensus</p><p>The WPA went through a large number of revisions since its introduction in January, with a flurry of amendments and adjustments taking place over the last few weeks of negotiations. Ultimately, a number of critical policy issues proved too contentious for consensus to emerge, said 11th District Rep. Zack Hudgins, who chairs the House's Innovation, Technology and Economic Development committee, and was involved with the bill.</p><p>One of the most argued issues was the bill's approach to the regulation of facial recognition software, Hudgins said. Critics, many of which supported a total moratorium on the technology, have argued that face recording victimizes minority demographics, and presents a more generalized threat to civil liberties. Most versions of WPA allowed a looser approach to the technology, with proponents of more lax regulations -- often industry groups -- arguing the bill struck \"the right balance\" of permissiveness and restriction.</p><p>Meanwhile, enforcement proved another stumbling block. The Washington bill differed from the GDPR and the CPPA in that it did not allow for a private right of action -- that is, the ability of individuals to sue companies if they infringed upon their rights. Instead, the WPA ceded the role of enforcement to the state's Attorney General's Office, which would have acted parens patria -- on behalf of a collective of people presumably affected by corporate malfeasance. The lack of private right of action within the bill was something that some legislators and activists consistently criticized.</p><p>Discussions also came to a head over the issue of basic definitions for bill terms, said Hudgins. Overly broad wording for certain key terms led to a fear that companies would be able to \"put almost anything into a user agreement,\" he said. \"That's where I thought the bill could have been better and stronger; there were some of these [rhetorical] loopholes in it.\"</p><p>Industry Voices and the Political Process</p><p>Privacy rights activists have alleged that the state's tech industry had a disproportionate influence in crafting the legislation.</p><p>Industry representatives from companies, including Microsoft, were consistently involved in the negotiations and had a visible presence at most public meetings associated with the bill, according to those knowledgable about the situation.</p><p>Furthermore, many of those same representatives publicly criticized another privacy bill with stronger consumer protections that was drafted by the ACLU and introduced in January, according to Shankar Narayan, the director of the organization's Washington chapter. When that bill floundered, industry figures then rallied around Carlyle's bill, which had looser regulation and fewer protections, he said.</p><p>\"Overall, we really see this [bill] as big tech attempting to preempt meaningful regulation by seizing control of the process themselves, essentially writing a bill and putting a ton of resources and pressure on the legislature to pass it without a real public process,\" said Narayan, in an interview with Government Technology.</p><p>Hudgins said he wasn't sure it was fair to characterize tech companies' influence as \"disproportionate,\" but said they were very involved in the process.</p><p>\"I can tell you that the industry was spending a lot of time on the bill,\" Hudgins said. \"There were a lot of lobbyists. There was a lot of discussion. They were in the room. There were a lot of meetings. I don't know if it was disproportionate or not, but they were very involved with the bill all the way through the process.\"</p><p>Closed-door meetings hosted and facilitated by the governor's office during the final stretch of negotiations saw invitations to a cadre of senators and representatives, as well as to officials from Amazon, Comcast, Microsoft, and the Association of Washington Business, emails provided by the ACLU show.

While there is still technically an opportunity for the bill to advance, it is not expected to be discussed again this session, said Alex Alben, the state's chief privacy officer.</p><p>The bill's primary sponsor, Sen. Reuven Carlyle, D-Seattle, took to social media Thursday, saying that he was committed to seeing legislation passed next year.</p><p>\"We built alignment that well-crafted, strong #dataprivacy is imperative to consumers and society. Unfortunately, House failed to pass privacy legislation this year. We're committed to 2020,\" Carlyle tweeted.</p><p>Why the bill failed is a matter of who you ask. Proponents of the bill have said it was purely a matter of the House and Senate not being able to get on the same page, while privacy rights activists have laid blame for the irresolution on the tech industry and its resistance to certain consumer protections that some legislators wanted to include.</p><p>Lack of Consensus</p><p>The WPA went through a large number of revisions since its introduction in January, with a flurry of amendments and adjustments taking place over the last few weeks of negotiations. Ultimately, a number of critical policy issues proved too contentious for consensus to emerge, said 11th District Rep. Zack Hudgins, who chairs the House's Innovation, Technology and Economic Development committee, and was involved with the bill.</p><p>One of the most argued issues was the bill's approach to the regulation of facial recognition software, Hudgins said. Critics, many of which supported a total moratorium on the technology, have argued that face recording victimizes minority demographics, and presents a more generalized threat to civil liberties. Most versions of WPA allowed a looser approach to the technology, with proponents of more lax regulations -- often industry groups -- arguing the bill struck \"the right balance\" of permissiveness and restriction.</p><p>Meanwhile, enforcement proved another stumbling block. The Washington bill differed from the GDPR and the CPPA in that it did not allow for a private right of action -- that is, the ability of individuals to sue companies if they infringed upon their rights. Instead, the WPA ceded the role of enforcement to the state's Attorney General's Office, which would have acted parens patria -- on behalf of a collective of people presumably affected by corporate malfeasance. The lack of private right of action within the bill was something that some legislators and activists consistently criticized.</p><p>Discussions also came to a head over the issue of basic definitions for bill terms, said Hudgins. Overly broad wording for certain key terms led to a fear that companies would be able to \"put almost anything into a user agreement,\" he said. \"That's where I thought the bill could have been better and stronger; there were some of these [rhetorical] loopholes in it.\"</p><p>Industry Voices and the Political Process</p><p>Privacy rights activists have alleged that the state's tech industry had a disproportionate influence in crafting the legislation.</p><p>Industry representatives from companies, including Microsoft, were consistently involved in the negotiations and had a visible presence at most public meetings associated with the bill, according to those knowledgable about the situation.</p><p>Furthermore, many of those same representatives publicly criticized another privacy bill with stronger consumer protections that was drafted by the ACLU and introduced in January, according to Shankar Narayan, the director of the organization's Washington chapter. When that bill floundered, industry figures then rallied around Carlyle's bill, which had looser regulation and fewer protections, he said.</p><p>\"Overall, we really see this [bill] as big tech attempting to preempt meaningful regulation by seizing control of the process themselves, essentially writing a bill and putting a ton of resources and pressure on the legislature to pass it without a real public process,\" said Narayan, in an interview with Government Technology.</p><p>Hudgins said he wasn't sure it was fair to characterize tech companies' influence as \"disproportionate,\" but said they were very involved in the process.</p><p>\"I can tell you that the industry was spending a lot of time on the bill,\" Hudgins said. \"There were a lot of lobbyists. There was a lot of discussion. They were in the room. There were a lot of meetings. I don't know if it was disproportionate or not, but they were very involved with the bill all the way through the process.\"</p><p>Closed-door meetings hosted and facilitated by the governor's office during the final stretch of negotiations saw invitations to a cadre of senators and representatives, as well as to officials from Amazon, Comcast, Microsoft, and the Association of Washington Business, emails provided by the ACLU show. However, other consumer interest groups were left out of the picture when they should have been included, said Narayan.</p><p>\"There was a discussion about why there weren't other voices in the room,\" Hudgins said, of the closed-door meetings. \"It certainly doesn't look good when you've only got industry folks there and not consumer voices. Certainly the elected officials are there to help protect consumers.\"</p><p>Future Legislation</p><p>Even as Washington failed to pass the WPA, it seems clear that comprehensive privacy legislation is on the rise.

Given that Canada has some of the highest Internet and wireless costs in the world, rejecting new fees or taxes that would further increase those costs should not require any hedging or attempts to change the subject. In fact, while the Canadian Heritage committee[1] and the CRTC[2] have proposed new wireless fees and taxes, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau clearly rejected the approach. </p><p>For example, minutes after the Heritage report was released, he told the press[3]: 'We respect the independence of committees and Parliament and the work and the studies they do, but allow me to be clear: We're not raising taxes on the middle class, we're lowering them. We're not going to be raising taxes on the middle class through an internet broadband tax. That is not an idea we are taking on.' Months later, when asked about the issue in the House of Commons, he stated[4]: Mr. Speaker, the NDP is proposing to raise taxes on the middle class, which is something we promised we would not do and have not done. We explicitly promised in the 2015 election campaign that we would not be raising taxes on Netflix. People may remember Stephen Harper's attack ads on that. They were false. We actually moved forward in demonstrating that we were not going to raise taxes on consumers, who pay enough for their Internet at home. Yet when asked about the issue by the Toronto Star[5], only the NDP even acknowledged the link between mandated contributions by Internet providers and affordability. The Liberal response avoided the issue altogether: We are committed to ensuring that Canada's tax system is fair and supports an innovative economy. The issue of how to appropriately ensure web giants pay their fair share is not a uniquely Canadian problem \u2014 it is a global issue. That's why Canada is working with our international partners and the OECD to come up with a consensus-based approach. One that ensures every company pays their fair share, while also continuing to foster innovation and attract investment in the digital sector. With this in mind, we will continue to work with the OECD to develop an approach that is concerted, prudent, and fair for the middle class. (Note: This answer was given before the Liberals announced as part of their election platform that they would introduce a 3 per cent tax on the income of large digital companies operating in Canada. The party would ensure 'multinational tech giants pay corporate tax on the revenue they generate in Canada,' according to a statement released by the party.) The Conservatives had little to say: We need to take action to review how innovative market solutions can help address these problems. Only the NDP pointed to affordability: The main focus of the NDP would be to ensure that foreign multinationals are treated equally with Canadian companies and to make sure that internet services are affordable. We are paying some (of) the highest prices for broadband subscriptions in the world. This is wrong. The NDP has a clear vision for Canadian arts and culture including: protecting our heritage, supporting key Canadian institutions and providing an opportunity for our Canadian talent to thrive on digital and traditional platforms. We need more Canadian content. For this reason, we will find innovative ways to increase the funding of the Canada Media Fund. This should not be difficult. There is little debate that Canadians pay some of the highest prices in the world for wireless and broadband services. New levies and taxes will further increase those costs. The parties should have no trouble committing that they will not introduce new levies, fees or taxes on Internet access.

The company was found to have restricted competition through the use of its dominance in the mobile market. Officials believe that Google's business practices, including using Google Play rules to block manufacturers forking Android, is an abuse of its power. The Commission also believes that financial incentives were used to ensure that they \"exclusively pre-install Google search on their devices.\" The fine is the largest in European Union history, dwarfing the \u20ac2.4 billion penalty handed out to Google in 2017. Confused?</p><p> Let us help you get all caught up.What has Google done wrong?The EU believes that Google has abused its dominant power in ways that are designed to crowd out other businesses. Officials say that since 2011, the company has \"imposed illegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators.\" These restrictions have ensured that Google has been able to \"cement its dominant position in general internet search.\"Officials say that the search engine has \"made payments to certain large manufacturers and mobile network operators.\" The payments are allegedly intended to ensure that carriers only installed Google Search on their devices. And since users are often satisfied with their default option, Google's products remained the most used across the continent.The other part of the charge relates to how Google ships versions of Android to the manufacturers who put it on their devices. There are, you see, two different flavors of Android, \"Android GMS (Google Mobile Services),\" and \"Android AOSP (Android Open Source Project.)\"Android GMS is the flavor you're probably familiar with if you own a handset from a brand-name manufacturer. Now, there are two things that you'll find on pretty much every GMS device: access to Google Play, and Google's core apps pre-installed. So, instead of a generic browser and email client, you'll find Chrome and Gmail there on the home screen. That's not a coincidence, because if you don't have those pre-installed, you don't have access to Play.AOSP, however, as the open-source version of Android, doesn't come pre-installed with Google's apps. And, as a consequence, doesn't have access to Google Play, reducing the ability for users to easily download new apps. But AOSP has been tweaked by numerous developers, especially in lower-cost handsets, as well as for specific commercial applications.The EU feels that by withholding Google Play on the condition of using GMS, it has essentially ensured that the majority of Android handsets have Google's blessing. And, in doing so, enables \"Google to use Android as a vehicle to cement the dominance of its search engine.\"Officials can even cite an example: Amazon's Fire tablets run an AOSP fork called Fire OS which lacks access to Google Play. Instead, you have to use Amazon's own app store and services with the platform, which runs on Amazon devices. But apparently, there was interest from other manufacturers who may have wanted to use Fire OS on their own hardware, but were prevented from doing so by Google's licensing deals.Isn't that Google's right? It gives Android away for free, after all...It is, and this is probably one of the hardest and most complex issues that has to be wrestled with. Because Google has to guard its own business, the security of its users and the integrity of the Play store, there is logic to keeping them separated.On the other hand, because of Google's size and reach, it can appear to be something closer to a threat than a promise. Use Android, the company says, but you'll have to play by our rules if you want it to work with the most popular services in the world. Not to mention that the GMS lock-in ensures that users often stick with the defaults of Chrome and Gmail.And, again, the EU Competition Commissioner believes that money changed hands to ensure that Google Search was the only search offered on certain products. That, combined with the contractual terms that mean manufacturers can't build rival platforms based on AOSP, makes it look pretty shady.Google has been in trouble with the EU before, hasn't it.Yes, and last year the search engine was slapped with a \u20ac2.4 billion fine[3] regarding perceived abuses of Google Shopping. When you search Google to compare products, its own price comparison tool is prominently displayed within the results. The EU believed that doing so enabled Google to steer users away from rival comparison portals.What is Google's take?Back in 2016, Google's Kent Walker said that the EU has both misunderstood the mobile market and how Google operates. \"Android is not a 'one way street,'\" he wrote on Google's policy blog[4], but \"a multi-lane highway of choice.\" Walker also tackled the topic of licensing payments, saying that bundling Google Play and Google mobile apps lets it offer the apps \"for free.\"Another big objection was that the EU didn't consider iOS to be a competitor product for Android, whereas pretty much everyone else thinks that it is. Walker also said that without Google's intervention, Android would become fragmented and unusable. The EU disputed that in its findings, saying that Apple devices are aimed at a niche market of wealthier buyers, and doesn't constrain Google, since those handsets also use Google Search.Will this hurt Google / Alphabet's bottom line?The EU has a complicated way of calculating fines that includes looking at the size of the market and a limit of no more than 10 percent of annual revenue. In the first quarter of 2018 alone, Alphabet (Google's corporate parent) brought in $31 million and made a $9.4 billion profit[5]. The fine will make some Alphabet accountants hide under their desks for a week, it's not going to hurt Google in the long term.What will happen to Android?That's the key issue, and certainly Google may be forced to alter the way it deals with AOSP devices. The EU's instruction was to stop doing the three things that it felt were an abuse of its position: Illegal tying of Google's search and browser appsIllegal payments conditional on exclusive pre-installation of Google search.Illegal obstruction of development and distribution of competing Android operating systems. What that will look like is going to be interesting and it may mean that Google could be forced to offer Play Store access to AOSP devices. Google has always maintained that doing so would be difficult because of increased hardware and software fragmentation.The EU, however, says that Google's objections on a technical level don't stack up, saying that it \"did not provide credible evidence that Android forks would be affected by technical failures or fail to support apps.\" It remains to be seen, therefore, if Google was making more of Android's limitations than in reality, or the EU has greatly overestimated Android's capabilities.On the GMS front, it's likely that Google can simply offer a pop-up to appear during setup that would offer users the choice of alternative mail and browser clients. This already happens in Russia, where you're asked if you'd prefer to use Chrome, Yandex or Mail.ru. And that was remedy enough to allow Microsoft to continue operating back in the heyday of Internet Explorer.What's going to happen in future?Much like with Microsoft, Google is now firmly in the European Union's sights, and that's going to be an issue in the future. Because, like Microsoft, Google's size and reach means that it will always have to think about how its business moves play out in the EU. Microsoft spent years treading on eggshells in Europe, always at risk of a massive fine if it -- like when it stopped offering a choice of internet browsers in Windows 7 SP1 Updates[6] -- breaks the rules again.Why is the European Union involved?The European Union is, at its heart, a massive, continent-spanning body that is designed to ensure that the free market remains a free market. It watches companies go about their business and, if it spots something that could distort the market, it investigates. When a business gets too big, and can start throwing its monopoly power around to suppress competition, the EU can step in with fines.Big Tech has often found itself clashing with the EU, which is significantly more proactive and thoughtful than its US equivalent. Through the late '90s and early '00s, the European Commission (which is the administrative arm of the EU) battled with Microsoft over both server tech and streaming media. The body later made Microsoft offer users a choice of browser rather than defaulting to Internet Explorer.The issue in those cases were if Microsoft was abusing its power to block competitors from using rival technologies. These days, the song remains the same, but the lyrics have been re-written to talk about the new behemoth in the tech world: Google. It is, after all, one of the three biggest[7] technology companies in the world, and the EU says that it controls 80% of the smartphone market in Europe.And the countries that make up the European Union, combined, represent some 508 million people. That makes it a bigger potential market than the US and Russia put together, and one of the wealthiest. If you want to do business there, you have to play by the EU's rules, which are all about high standards.What will Google do next?Google has been given a deadline of 90 days to \"bring the conduct\" -- the three numbered violations -- \"effectively to an end.\" If it does not, the company will face a daily fine worth around five percent of Alphabet's daily turnover. In a statement, Google has already said that \"Android has created more choice for everyone, not less. A vibrant ecosystem, rapid innovation, and lower prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition.\" It added that, as expected, \"we will appeal the Commission's decision\" Europa[8]This article originally appeared on Engadget at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/18/google-android-antitrust-explainer/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603\">https://www.engadget.com/2018/07/18/google-android-antitrust-explainer/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000603</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/15/eu-antitrust-investigation-into-google-official/\">https://www.engadget.com/2015/04/15/eu-antitrust-investigation-into-google-official/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/20/google-android-europe-antitrust-statement-of-objections/\">https://www.engadget.com/2016/04/20/google-android-europe-antitrust-statement-of-objections/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/27/europe-google-antitrust-record-fine/\">https://www.engadget.com/2017/06/27/europe-google-antitrust-record-fine/</url> [ 4]: https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/android-choice-competition-response-europe/ [ 5]: https://abc.xyz/investor/pdf/2018Q1_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/2495931/technology-law-regulation/eu-fines-microsoft--732m-over-browser-ballot-debacle.html\">https://www.computerworld.com/article/2495931/technology-law-regulation/eu-fines-microsoft--732m-over-browser-ballot-debacle.html</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/screening/companies-by-industry.aspx?industry=Technology...tname=marketcap...ttype=1\">https://www.nasdaq.com/screening/companies-by-industry.aspx?industry=Technology...tname=marketcap...ttype=1</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4581_en.htm\">http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4581_en.htm</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AOLB103284153191661021925176170001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AOLB-5150</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STW-Y2J1-JCMN-Y44X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1831\"/><timeReceived>12:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Engadget HD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 18, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Donald Trump has given his blessings. Donald Trump has set a deadline for the deal. Well, depending on which side of the bed you wake up and what day it is, the intersection of politics and technology is undoubtedly creating more confusion that it does good. At the time of writing this, it seems the political dispensation in the US is okay with Microsoft going ahead with the attempt to follow through on its interest in acquiring TikTok. At least the operations for certain parts of the world, including the US. Works out well for the tech giant, because TikTok is trying everything possible to remain present and active, in the US in particular, where it has a large and active user base. But the question still remains, why does Microsoft want to buy TikTok?   The way things have been over the past few years, Microsoft has focused on the enterprise space. The part consumer plays, that have included the Surface computing device line-up and the revamped Microsoft 365 subscriptions, in the end, do plug into the enterprise space very nicely. But Microsoft, for most intents and purposes, doesn\u2019t really do consumer products. Except perhaps the Microsoft Xbox ecosystem. Let us look at some of Microsoft\u2019s consumer products that no longer are around. Windows Phone, Groove Music, the Microsoft Band fitness accessory are some examples. Cortana, the virtual assistant, seems to be going down that path\u2014the app for Android and iOS will be shut down next year, along with Cortana access for Harman Kardon Invoke smart speakers and the first-generation Microsoft Surface headphones. Cortana instead is getting deeper integration within the Outlook email app and Teams video meeting app, which have great enterprise significance. Gives you a sense of the demographic of users Microsoft is largely designing products and services for.   At this time, it is believed Microsoft wants to acquire TikTok\u2019s operations for US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \u201cThis is a unique deal of a decade opportunity with a price tag that could easily be consummated,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush, to the investors earlier this week, as reported by CNN . It is believed TikTok\u2019s value stands at $50 billion.   One of the primary reasons why Microsoft believes TikTok is an investment worth doing is it will get a readymade product in the social media space. The closest Microsoft right now is to that space is with LinkedIn, a professional network. Yet, it is no match for the might of Facebook, the Facebook owned Instagram and even Twitter and Snapchat. Maybe that LinkedIn acquisition holds a clue\u2014Microsoft didn\u2019t change the branding or the foundations of the network that made it successful in the space it operates. If the company does the same with TikTok, as in leave the branding and the app as is, it could simply be successful because of the numbers that drive TikTok engagement on a daily basis. The only change would be that the user data for US based accounts will be saved on servers in the US. As a consumer, that would make no difference, except you may perhaps have to again accept the new terms and conditions at some point when you open the app post the expected Microsoft acquisition.   Second, it is the oil of the modern world. Data. It all started with data, and the fears that data of US users was ending up with the Chinese government. After all, TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. In China, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 governs all tech companies that are based in China or are under Chinese ownership. The law mandates all businesses to share any and all information that the Chinese Government may ask for. This is something that is worrying governments around the world, including India.   Microsoft acknowledges the importance of the data that it\u2019ll get from TikTok. \u201cAmong other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred,\u201d says the company in an official statement confirming the talks.  Story continues  As of January, TikTok had clocked 800 million users worldwide. The app saw more than 49 million downloads in the US just last year. On an average, TikTok users in the US open the app 8 times a day, with each session around 5 minutes\u2014that works out to around 40 minutes of app usage in a day. This is the sort of ready-made platforms that don\u2019t become available so easily for tech companies to acquire. Microsoft will finally have a product to take Facebook on with.   If you notice the list of countries that Microsoft wants to acquire TikTok in, these are all English-speaking. That would mean limited challenges when it comes to moderating content as well, without having to deal with complexities of localization.   TikTok is as consumer centric as it gets. In fact, this gives Microsoft a head-start in trying to understand a younger demographic of users, who will consume more services and apps in the years to come. While Microsoft fell behind with the previous generation with its much delayed attempts at battling with Google, Apple and Facebook in the past when it came to platforms such as Windows Phone, Outlook Mail, Bing Search and social networks in general, it\u2019ll have an advantage over the rival big tech companies when it comes to understanding these users that it\u2019ll adopt with TikTok.   Microsoft is also in a safe spot as far as regulators are concerned. While Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are all very much under scrutiny by the US Congress, Microsoft hasn\u2019t been dragged into it just yet because of its business and enterprise focus.   Remember, TikTok is the one social media platform that has had Facebook worried for a while now. The popularity, the quick video format and the product itself has been some concern for Facebook, which is trying the same with Instagram Reels. With Microsoft\u2019s might behind it, TikTok can logically stand to gain. The key for Microsoft will be to leave TikTok as is, and not make it a Microsoft product.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42764219179</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-YBD1-F07F-848C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1093\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

In fact, this could give Microsoft a head-start in trying to understand a younger demographic of users, who will consume more services and apps in the years to come.   Vishal Mathur       Microsoft wants to buy TikTok. Donald Trump is not happy about it. Donald Trump is okay with it. Donald Trump has given his blessings. Donald Trump has set a deadline for the deal. Well, depending on which side of the bed you wake up and what day it is, the intersection of politics and technology is undoubtedly creating more confusion that it does good. At the time of writing this, it seems the political dispensation in the US is okay with Microsoft going ahead with the attempt to follow through on its interest in acquiring TikTok. At least the operations for certain parts of the world, including the US. Works out well for the tech giant, because TikTok is trying everything possible to remain present and active, in the US in particular, where it has a large and active user base. But the question still remains, why does Microsoft want to buy TikTok?   The way things have been over the past few years, Microsoft has focused on the enterprise space. The part consumer plays, that have included the Surface computing device line-up and the revamped Microsoft 365 subscriptions, in the end, do plug into the enterprise space very nicely. But Microsoft, for most intents and purposes, doesn\u2019t really do consumer products. Except perhaps the Microsoft Xbox ecosystem. Let us look at some of Microsoft\u2019s consumer products that no longer are around. Windows Phone, Groove Music, the Microsoft Band fitness accessory are some examples. Cortana, the virtual assistant, seems to be going down that path\u2014the app for Android and iOS will be shut down next year, along with Cortana access for Harman Kardon Invoke smart speakers and the first-generation Microsoft Surface headphones. Cortana instead is getting deeper integration within the Outlook email app and Teams video meeting app, which have great enterprise significance. Gives you a sense of the demographic of users Microsoft is largely designing products and services for.    At this time, it is believed Microsoft wants to acquire TikTok\u2019s operations for US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. \u201cThis is a unique deal of a decade opportunity with a price tag that could easily be consummated,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, analyst at Wedbush, to the investors earlier this week. It is believed TikTok\u2019s value stands at $50 billion.   One of the primary reasons why Microsoft believes TikTok is an investment worth doing is it will get a readymade product in the social media space. The closest Microsoft right now is to that space is with LinkedIn, a professional network. Yet, it is no match for the might of Facebook, the Facebook owned Instagram and even Twitter and Snapchat. Maybe that LinkedIn acquisition holds a clue\u2014Microsoft didn\u2019t change the branding or the foundations of the network that made it successful in the space it operates. If the company does the same with TikTok, as in leave the branding and the app as is, it could simply be successful because of the numbers that drive TikTok engagement on a daily basis. The only change would be that the user data for US based accounts will be saved on servers in the US. As a consumer, that would make no difference, except you may perhaps have to again accept the new terms and conditions at some point when you open the app post the expected Microsoft acquisition.   Second, it is the oil of the modern world. Data. It all started with data, and the fears that data of US users was ending up with the Chinese government. After all, TikTok is owned by Chinese company ByteDance. In China, the National Intelligence Law of 2017 governs all tech companies that are based in China or are under Chinese ownership. The law mandates all businesses to share any and all information that the Chinese Government may ask for. This is something that is worrying governments around the world, including India.   Microsoft acknowledges the importance of the data that it\u2019ll get from TikTok. \u201cAmong other measures, Microsoft would ensure that all private data of TikTok\u2019s American users is transferred to and remains in the United States. To the extent that any such data is currently stored or backed-up outside the United States, Microsoft would ensure that this data is deleted from servers outside the country after it is transferred,\u201d says the company in an official statement confirming the talks.    As of January, TikTok had clocked 800 million users worldwide. The app saw more than 49 million downloads in the US just last year. On an average, TikTok users in the US open the app 8 times a day, with each session around 5 minutes\u2014that works out to around 40 minutes of app usage in a day. This is the sort of ready-made platforms that don\u2019t become available so easily for tech companies to acquire. Microsoft will finally have a product to take Facebook on with.   If you notice the list of countries that Microsoft wants to acquire TikTok in, these are all English-speaking. That would mean limited challenges when it comes to moderating content as well, without having to deal with complexities of localization.   TikTok is as consumer centric as it gets. In fact, this gives Microsoft a head-start in trying to understand a younger demographic of users, who will consume more services and apps in the years to come. While Microsoft fell behind with the previous generation with its much delayed attempts at battling with Google, Apple and Facebook in the past when it came to platforms such as Windows Phone, Outlook Mail, Bing Search and social networks in general, it\u2019ll have an advantage over the rival big tech companies when it comes to understanding these users that it\u2019ll adopt with TikTok.   Microsoft is also in a safe spot as far as regulators are concerned. While Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon are all very much under scrutiny by the US Congress, Microsoft hasn\u2019t been dragged into it just yet because of its business and enterprise focus.   Remember, TikTok is the one social media platform that has had Facebook worried for a while now. The popularity, the quick video format and the product itself has been some concern for Facebook, which is trying the same with Instagram Reels. With Microsoft\u2019s might behind it, TikTok can logically stand to gain. The key for Microsoft will be to leave TikTok as is, and not make it a Microsoft product.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42764155464</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-YBD1-F07F-8436-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1126\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>News18.com</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

After all, experts have noted for decades than US antitrust enforcement has grown toothless and frail[1], and our definitions of monopoly power need updating in the Amazon era[2]. Facebook's repeated face plants on privacy (and basic transparency and integrity) have only added fuel to the fire amidst calls to regulate \"big tech.\" But while Silicon Valley giants now face an endless cavalcade of outrage in DC, the telecom sector[3] is suddenly seeing no scrutiny whatsoever. Whether it's the speed at which the problematic T-Mobile merger is being shoveled through the DOJ and FCC[4], or the blind eye being turned to major telecom privacy scandals[5] (like location data), telecom lobbyists have been on a successful tear convincing well-heeled DC lawmakers to ignore the massive, obvious monopoly, privacy, and competition issues inherent in telecom to focus exclusively on the problems in \"big tech.\" This crusade against \"big tech\" has seen no shortage of advocates who've historically been absent on glaring and painful monopoly and consumer protection issues in other sectors. Like Marsha Blackburn, who has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181107/08073641002/marsha-blackburn-continues-to-be-rewarded-screwing-up-internet.shtmlrubber\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20181107/08073641002/marsha-blackburn-continues-to-be-rewarded-screwing-up-internet.shtmlrubber</url> stamped every fleeting monopolistic and privacy-violating whim[6] AT...xecutives have ever had, yet is now branding herself as some sort of consumer advocacy and privacy expert[7] as she rails against \"big tech.\" </p><p>Another major voice in the \"battle to fix 'big tech'\" has been Josh Hawley, who has been endlessly vocal about the issues with big tech[8], but just as absent as Blackburn when it comes to criticizing the same exact problems plaguing the telecom sector. Last week, Hawley unveiled a plan to fix the FTC[9] (pdf) -- an agency, he correctly notes, that has been largely feckless when it comes to reining in the bad behavior of lumbering giants like Facebook:\"As it stands today, the FTC lacks teeth. Its jurisdiction is divided. It wastes time in turf wars with the Department of Justice (DOJ) while failing to confront the increasing concentration in our economy, in the tech sector most obviously. And it is woefully unaccountable. The agency as presently constituted is in no shape to ensure competition in today's markets, let alone tomorrow's.\"He's certainly not wrong on that. If anything, he undersells the problem. The FTC has somewhere around 8% of the staff[10] focused on resolving privacy issues as its counterpart in the UK, despite the UK having a fifth as many people as the US. The FTC is also a cesspool of revolving door conflicts[11], with most employees having either recently left the companies they're supposed to hold accountable, or simply biding their time until they can go lobby for those same companies. And, like the FCC, its partisan majority makeup results in whiplash as the parties jerk the reins of policy from one side of the spectrum to the other. This is not some inadvertent error. An understaffed, underpowered FTC is the intentional lobbying byproduct of giant U.S. companies that don't find taxpayer or regulatory accountability particularly exciting. It's why even when the FTC finally acts on an issue, its solutions (as we saw with Equifax[12] or Facebook[13]) are pathetic messes that in no way deter future bad behavior (and in some ways only encourage the problems to repeat themselves). It's a feature, not a bug. Hawley's cure for this involves essentially gutting the agency as it stands, then rolling it into the DOJ to provide \"clear and direct oversight.\" His effort would also eliminate the FTC's five-member structure, which, like the FCC, is based on a partisan 3-2 split depending which party holds the Presidency. Instead, the FTC boss would fall under the authority of a Senate-confirmed single director serving a five-year term. There's stuff under Hawley's plan that's certainly common sense -- stricter controls on ethics, antitrust enforcement all under one umbrella at the DOJ, etc. The problem is several fold. For one, do we really want ex-Verizon lawyer Bill Barr in charge of the FTC? Couldn't giving that kind of leverage to Barr only aid his relentless effort to break encryption and put backdoors into, well, everything[14]? Meanwhile, the partisan FTC strife Hawley claims to be eliminating would probably just jump over to the confirmation hearing process, and the numerous hearings and laws you'd likely need to make his plan a reality. The other big problem: a lot of these regulatory \"modernization\" plans often wind up being little more than exercises in butchery dressed up as reform once they actually materialize in the wild. Case in point: with its recent net neutrality repeal, the FCC recently neutered its authority over telecom providers at telecom lobbyist behest amidst claims it would create \"internet freedom\" and spur investment (neither happened[15]). But contrary to public wisdom, the repeal didn't just kill net neutrality. It effectively gutted the FCC, shoveling much of its responsibilities over to the FTC -- an agency that lacks the authority or resources[16] to actually police the telecom sector. This was, in case you're a little slow, the entire reason the telecom lobby pushed for it. It wanted consumer protection and accountability to fall into a deep, dark chasm. It's working, and a lot of blatant efforts by telecom to rip users off[17] or violate their privacy[18] have gone utterly unpunished amidst crickets from \"big tech\" reformers. Gutting already shaky oversight is not really \"reform,\" and I'm curious what happens to telecom oversight if we destroy the existing FTC and hand management of the telecom sector over to Bill Barr. Former Verizon lawyers would be running both the FCC and FTC, and both consumer protection and antitrust enforcement would fall to a duo who've shown less than zero interest in reining in AT...Verizon and Comcast, or the trio's thirty year track record of aggressively anti-consumer, anti-innovation, and anti-competitive behavior. Behavior that was being bone-grafted to the American institution while Google and Facebook were still just twinkles in youngsters' eyes. One might feel better about this if the perils of telecom monopolies weren't so utterly absent from Hawley's rhetoric. When you dig through his plan or his lengthy treatises on reform over at his website or in speeches, big telecom is almost never mentioned[19] -- despite the sector engaging in many of the same, or worse[20] behaviors. Much like Blackburn, Hawley appears to have placed the entire onus for the modern internet's ills securely on the back of big tech, while giving telecom a free pass. Why do you think that is, exactly? There are certainly plenty of reasons to criticize big tech giants like Facebook, whose face plants on privacy are now the stuff of legend. But big telecom is every bit as bad as big tech. As companies like ComcastNBC Universal and AT...ime Warner increasingly push into the ad tech space, they've been eagerly pushing a crackdown on the big tech giants whose market share they hope to erode[21]. Any quest to fix the US' broken antitrust and consumer protection enforcement has to take a bigger picture view that identifies both big tech and big telecom monopolies as part of the same giant problem. Politicians that fixate exclusively on the former are either being painfully but genuinely myopic, or they're exhibiting a byproduct of relentless lobbying by the telecom sector, which has been pushing for this special brand of asymmetrical \"reform\"[22] for several years now.Permalink[23] | Comments[24] | Email This Story[25] [ 1]: <url

After all, it was Democrats who supported labour unions, higher minimum wages, expanded unemployment insurance, Medicare and generous Social Security, helping to lift workers into the middle class.   Of course, an alternative economic view, led by economists like Milton Friedman, was that this turn toward the Republican Party was rational and served workers\u2019 interests. He emphasised free markets, entrepreneurialism and the maximisation of profit. These, Friedman argued, would raise wages for many and even most Americans.   But wages did not rise. And yet many in the working class kept voting Republican, still seemingly angered by Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, which was dedicated to helping the poor and assuring equal rights for people of colour. In the 1980s, under Ronald Reagan, income inequality began to rise sharply; wages for typical Americans stagnated and poverty and homelessness increased. Capital investment remained relatively weak despite deep tax cuts (as it does today under Donald Trump). At the same time, antitrust regulation was severely wounded, and giant corporations began to monopolise industry after industry.   But the presidential election of 2016 sent the sharpest message yet. Working-class voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin opted for Trump, and apparently against their economic interests. Trump had succeeded in appealing to their anger and the Democrats were caught flat-footed.       THE SYSTEM    Who Rigged It, How We Fix It   Robert B Reich   Alfred A Knopf; $24; 224 pages    BREAK \u2019EM UP   Recovering Our Freedom From Big Ag, Big Tech, and Big Money   Zephyr Teachout   All Points Books; $28.99; 320 pages       Two new books, The System , by the former labour secretary Robert B Reich, and Break \u2019Em Up , by the lawyer and activist Zephyr Teachout, a onetime candidate for New York State attorney general, are among the latest examples of an evolving set of explanations that try to make sense of the 2016 results. A powerful money-fuelled oligarchy has emerged in America that is an enemy of democracy, Mr Reich writes. The self-interested power of the nation\u2019s wealthy often goes unnoticed by voters, and is partly misdirected by right-wing rhetoric about issues like immigration. But it leads to lower wages, less product choice and abusive labour practices. Mr Trump has harnessed the frustration of the working class, he says, but he was a \u201csmokescreen\u201d for the oligarchy. Mr Reich observes that the question is no longer Democrat versus Republican or left versus right, but \u201cdemocracy versus oligarchy.\u201d   To Ms Teachout, what\u2019s behind our rigged system is the close cousin of oligarchy: corporate monopoly. Teachout lists her culprits, among them familiar names: Amazon, Google, Facebook, Monsanto, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Walmart, Pfizer, Comcast, Apple and CVS. These firms \u201crepresent a new political phenomenon,\u201d she says, \u201ca 21st-century form of centralised, authoritarian government.\u201d   Two dramatic related facts underscore the claims of both Reich and Teachout.  The much discussed rise of wealth among the top 0.1 per cent, which now has 20 per cent of the nation\u2019s wealth compared with only 10 per cent 40 years ago, has been brought to light in recent years by the innovative econ\u00ado\u00admists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez. The flip side is that wages for the large majority of American workers have stag\u00adna\u00adted more or less over this same period.    According to Mr Reich, the \u201canti-establishment fury\u201d that is the result of such inequity supersedes racial prejudice as the cause of Mr Trump\u2019s success. In 2001, more than three out of four workers were satisfied that they could get ahead by working hard. In 2014, only slightly more than one out of two thought so. Voters wanted badly to blame it all on the swamp Mr Trump promised to clean up.   For Mr Reich, the big oligarchical companies have the lobbying and campaign-financing muscle to win enormous tax cuts, suppress financial and environmental regulations, acquire new patents and subsidies, fight for free trade \u2014 it is a long list. For years, they successfully battled against higher minimum wages and labour laws that restricted their union-busting efforts.   Both authors say that Ronald Reagan led the way to the swift undoing of traditional antitrust regulation in the 1980s. But Mr Reich is almost as harsh on the Clinton and Obama administrations. Even when the Democrats controlled both houses of Congress, he writes, they allowed antitrust enforcement to \u201cossify,\u201d let companies hammer away at trade unions and went easy on Wall Street. They were also soft on the issue of campaign contributions, failing to advocate for public financing of elections.   Why? Mr Reich argues that the Democrats chose to turn their backs on the working class and pursue suburban swing voters. He knows, he tells us. He was there.   Mr Reich makes an example of Jamie Dimon, the chairman of JPMorgan Chase. For Mr Reich, he is representative of the CEO class that talks about corporate social resp\u00ado\u00ad\u00adnsibility but rarely practises it. A lif\u00ade\u00adt\u00adime Democrat, Mr Dimon was a major sup\u00adp\u00ado\u00adr\u00adt\u00ader of the Trump tax cut and does not support an increase in the minimum wage.   These are valuable books, and the anger they will generate may prove politically energising. But Mr Reich\u2019s claim that democracy will somehow prevail underestimates the dangers we face. As for Ms Teachout, more competition may help alleviate some problems, but it is in fact an idealised version of free market thinking.   Meanwhile, the current president is promising cuts in social policies that may well increase middle-income and working-class frustration. He wants to rewrite the official definition of poverty to claim that there are fewer poor. He undermines the rule of law on a regular basis. Voter suppression is common.   Is it any wonder that many fear democracy in America may not prevail?      \u00a92020 The New York Times News Service</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Microsoft's market cap is currently higher than those of Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. </p><p>If big is bad, then, at the moment, Microsoft is the worst.Apart from size, antitrust activists also claim that the structure and behavior of the Big Four \u2014 Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon \u2014 is why they deserve to be broken up. But they never include Microsoft, which is curious given that most of their critiques also apply to the largest tech giant: Microsoft is big (current market cap exceeds $1 trillion)Microsoft is dominant in narrowly-defined markets (e.g., desktop operating systems)Microsoft is simultaneously operating and competing on a platform (i.e., the Microsoft Store)Microsoft is a conglomerate capable of leveraging dominance from one market into another (e.g., Windows, Office 365, Azure)Microsoft has its own 'kill zone' for startups (196 acquisitions since 1994)Microsoft operates a search engine that preferences its own content over third-party content (i.e., Bing)Microsoft operates a platform that moderates user-generated content (i.e., LinkedIn) To be clear, this is not to say that an antitrust case against Microsoft is as strong as the case against the others. Rather, it is to say that the cases against the Big Four on these dimensions are as weak as the case against Microsoft, as I will show below. Big is bad Tim Wu published a book[2] last year arguing for more vigorous antitrust enforcement \u2014 including against Big Tech \u2014 called 'The Curse of Bigness.' As you can tell by the title, he argues, in essence, for a return to the bygone era of 'big is bad' presumptions. In his book, Wu mentions 'Microsoft' 29 times, but only in the context of its 1990s antitrust case. On the other hand, Wu has explicitly called for[3] antitrust investigations of Amazon, Facebook, and Google. It's unclear why big should be considered bad when it comes to the latter group but not when it comes to Microsoft. Maybe bigness isn't actually a curse, after all.As the saying goes in antitrust, 'Big is not bad; big behaving badly is bad.' This aphorism arose to counter erroneous reasoning during the era of structure-conduct-performance[4] when big was presumed to mean bad. Thanks to an improved theoretical and empirical understanding of the nature of the competitive process, there is now a consensus that firms can grow large either via superior efficiency or by engaging in anticompetitive behavior. Size alone does not tell us how a firm grew big \u2014 so it is not a relevant metric. Dominance in narrowly-defined markets Critics of Google say it has a monopoly on search[5] and critics of Facebook say it has a monopoly on social networking[6]. Microsoft is similarly dominant in at least a few narrowly-defined markets, including desktop operating systems (Windows has a 78% market share[7] globally):Source: StatCounter[8]Microsoft is also dominant in the 'professional networking platform' market after its acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016. And the legacy tech giant is still the clear leader in the 'paid productivity software' market. (Microsoft's Office 365 revenue is roughly 10x[9] Google's G Suite revenue).The problem here is obvious. These are overly-narrow market definitions for conducting an antitrust analysis. Is it true that Facebook's platforms are the only service that can connect you with your friends? Should we really restrict the productivity market to 'paid'-only options (as the EU similarly did in its Android decision[10]) when there are so many free options available? These questions are laughable. Proper market definition requires considering whether a hypothetical monopolist could profitably impose a small but significant and non-transitory increase in price[11] (SSNIP). If not (which is likely the case in the narrow markets above), then we should employ a broader market definition in each case. Simultaneously operating and competing on a platform Elizabeth Warren likes to say that if you own[12] a platform, then you shouldn't both be an umpire and have a team in the game. Let's put aside the problems[13] with that flawed analogy for now. What she means is that you shouldn't both run the platform and sell products, services, or apps on that platform (because it's inherently unfair to the other sellers).Warren's solution to this 'problem' would be to create a regulated class of businesses called 'platform utilities'[14] which are 'companies with an annual global revenue of $25 billion or more and that offer to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties.' Microsoft's revenue last quarter[15] was $32.5 billion, so it easily meets the first threshold. And Windows obviously qualifies as 'a platform for connecting third parties.'Just as in mobile operating systems, desktop operating systems are compatible with third-party applications. These third-party apps can be free (e.g., iTunes) or paid (e.g., Adobe Photoshop). Of course, Microsoft also makes apps for Windows (e.g., Word, PowerPoint, Excel, etc.). But the more you think about the technical details, the blurrier the line between the operating system and applications becomes. Is the browser an add-on to the OS or a part of it (as Microsoft Edge appears to be[16])? The most deeply-embedded applications in an OS are simply called 'features.'Even though Warren hasn't explicitly mentioned that her plan would cover Microsoft, it almost certainly would. Previously, she left Apple out of the Medium post announcing her policy, only to later tell a journalist that the iPhone maker would also be prohibited[17] from producing its own apps. But what Warren fails to include in her announcement that she would break up Apple is that trying to police the line between a first-party platform and third-party applications would be a nightmare[18] for companies and regulators, likely leading to less innovation and higher prices for consumers (as they attempt to rebuild their previous bundles). Leveraging dominance from one market into another The core critique in Lina Khan's 'Amazon's Antitrust Paradox[19]' is that the very structure of Amazon itself is what leads to its anticompetitive behavior. Khan argues (in spite of the data[20]) that Amazon uses profits in some lines of business to subsidize predatory pricing in other lines of businesses. Furthermore, she claims that Amazon uses data from its Amazon Web Services unit to spy on competitors and snuff them out before they become a threat.Of course, this is similar to the theory of harm[21] in Microsoft's 1990s antitrust case, that the desktop giant was leveraging its monopoly from the operating system market into the browser market. Why don't we hear the same concern today about Microsoft? Like both Amazon and Google, you could uncharitably describe Microsoft as extending its tentacles into as many sectors of the economy as possible. Here are some of the markets in which Microsoft competes (and note how the Big Four also compete in many of these same markets): Azure[22] in the cloud computing marketBing[23] in the search engine marketLinkedIn[24] in the professional social networking marketMicrosoft Dynamics[25] in the ERP and CRM marketsMicrosoft Servers[26] in the server marketMicrosoft Store[27] in the app store marketOffice 365[28] in the productivity software marketOutlook[29] in the email marketSkype[30] in the video chat marketSurface[31] in the tablet, laptop, and PC marketsVisual Studio[32] in the integrated development environment (IDE) marketWindows[33] in the operating system marketXbox[34] in the video game console market What these potential antitrust harms leave out are the clear consumer benefits from bundling and vertical integration. Microsoft's relationships with customers in one market might make it the most efficient vendor in related \u2014 but separate \u2014 markets. It is unsurprising, for example, that Windows customers would also frequently be Office customers. Furthermore, the zero marginal cost nature of software makes it an ideal product for bundling, which redounds to the benefit of consumers. The 'kill zone' for startups In a recent article[35] for The New York Times, Tim Wu and Stuart A. Thompson criticize Facebook and Google for the number of acquisitions they have made. They point out that 'Google has acquired at least 270 companies over nearly two decades' and 'Facebook has acquired at least 92 companies since 2007', arguing that allowing such a large number of acquisitions to occur is conclusive evidence of regulatory failure.Microsoft has made 196 acquisitions since 1994[36], but they receive no mention in the NYT article (or in most of the discussion around supposed 'kill zones'). But the acquisitions by Microsoft or Facebook or Google are, in general, not problematic. They provide a crucial channel for liquidity in the venture capital and startup communities (the other channel being IPOs). According to the latest data[37] from Orrick and Crunchbase, between 2010 and 2018, there were 21,844 acquisitions of tech startups for a total deal value of $1.193 trillion.By comparison, according to data compiled by Jay R. Ritter[38], a professor at the University of Florida, there were 331 tech IPOs for a total market capitalization of $649.6 billion over the same period. Making it harder for a startup to be acquired would not result in more venture capital investment (and therefore not in more IPOs), according to recent research[39] by Gordon M. Phillips and Alexei Zhdanov. The researchers show that 'the passage of a pro-takeover law in a country is associated with more subsequent VC deals in that country, while the enactment of a business combination antitakeover law in the U.S. has a negative effect on subsequent VC investment.'As investor and serial entrepreneur Leonard Speiser said recently[40], 'If the DOJ starts going after tech companies for making acquisitions, venture investors will be much less likely to invest in new startups, thereby reducing competition in a far more harmful way.' Search engine bias Google is often accused of biasing its search results to favor its own products and services. The argument goes that if we broke them up[41], a thousand search engines would bloom and competition among them would lead to less-biased search results. While it is a very difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 empirical question to determine what a 'neutral' search engine would return, one attempt[42] by Josh Wright found that 'own-content bias is actually an infrequent phenomenon, and Google references its own content more favorably than other search engines far less frequently than does Bing.'The report goes on to note that 'Google references own content in its first results position when no other engine does in just 6.7% of queries; Bing does so over twice as often (14.3%).' Arguably, users of a particular search engine might be more interested in seeing content from that company because they have a preexisting relationship. But regardless of how we interpret these results, it's clear this not a frequent phenomenon. So why is Microsoft being left out of the antitrust debate now? One potential reason why Google, Facebook, and Amazon have been singled out for criticism of practices that seem common in the tech industry (and are often pro-consumer) may be due to the prevailing business model in the journalism industry. Google and Facebook are by far the largest competitors in the digital advertising market, and Amazon is expected to be the third-largest player by next year, according to eMarketer[43]. As Ramsi Woodcock pointed out[44], news publications are also competing for advertising dollars, the type of conflict of interest that usually would warrant disclosure if, say, a journalist held stock in a company they were covering.Or perhaps Microsoft has successfully avoided receiving the same level of antitrust scrutiny as the Big Four because it is neither primarily consumer-facing like Apple or Amazon nor does it operate a platform with a significant amount of political speech via user-generated content[45] (UGC) like Facebook or Google (YouTube). Yes, Microsoft moderates content on LinkedIn, but the public does not get outraged when deplatforming merely prevents someone from spamming their colleagues with requests 'to add you to my professional network.'Microsoft's core areas are in the enterprise market, which allows it to sidestep the current debates about the supposed censorship of conservatives or unfair platform competition. To be clear, consumer-facing companies or platforms with user-generated content do not uniquely merit antitrust scrutiny. On the contrary, the benefits to consumers from these platforms are manifest. If this theory about why Microsoft has escaped scrutiny is correct, it means the public discussion thus far about Big Tech and antitrust has been driven by perception, not substance.

Now, with Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, and the <person><nameText>Obama Administration </nameText></person>focusing on reforming intelligence power, head-butting is looking likely.</p><p><br/>The president's goals<br/>Back in 2013, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>called for greater transparency from intelligence programs, and calling for a four-point plan which included: Reform of Section 215 of the Patriot Act \u2014 which empowers the FBI for seizure of tangible items in the course of an investigation \u2014 renovating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) by putting an opposition to the government into the equation, demanding release of as much information as possible via documents and data on various programs, and finally, review from non-government experts to evaluate the current system and its effects. A number of those goals required work alongside Congress, and while Sen. <person><nameText>Patrick Leahy </nameText></person>(D-Vt.) has taken up surveillance reform this year with similarly liberal viewpoints, the legislative atmosphere has obviously changed since Obama's announced plan in August of last year.<br/><person><nameText>Senator Leahy's </nameText></person>bill<br/>Even then, the legislation that the House managed to pass in May left major loopholes according to big tech companies who have voiced concerns about data collection that is still an available tool for intelligence agencies. 'This is a debate[1] about American's fundamental relationship with their government; about whether our government should have the power to create massive databases of information about its citizens or whether we are in control of our own government, not the other way around,' said <person><nameText>Sen. Leahy </nameText></person>on the Senate floor in proposing a new bill with more stringent rules, according to RT.<br/> His bill, introduced earlier this year, is now coming to a head, and it has some very apparent opponents in the majority party, including Senate Majority Leader <person><nameText>Mitch McConnell </nameText></person>(R-Ky.). This week he described Leahy's bill as one that 'would end one of our nation's critical capabilities to gather significant intelligence on terrorist threats,' saying that 'this is the worst possible time to be tying our hands behind our backs' \u2014 though requiring oversight and limitation to blanket data collection is hardly disarming America's well-endowed <person><nameText>national security </nameText></person>effort.Critical capability and September 11<br/> So what critical capability is McConnell referring to? Specifically, he lists the ability to collect and then analyze data to uncover 'links to potential terrorists,' claiming that holding that information in a third party \u2014 i.e. the phone company \u2014 would 'make it far harder for records to be gathered for a specific selection term.' He also is concerned that these companies 'face no statutory requirement to even hold the relevant data.'<br/> In short, the Republican argument comes down to terrorism and ISIL, with an emphasis on the technological abilities of extremist groups and the efforts made at drawing western and European recruits. Many\u00a0Democrats, including <person><nameText>President Obama, </nameText></person>argue that since\u00a09/11, national intelligence powers have grown\u00a0in tandem\u00a0with new demands and emergency requirements, but that these powers must eventually be limited. Besides simply needing to have an end date, they aren't\u00a0necessary to keep the nation safe. If situational powers are extended in perpetuity, liberties are in danger.<br/> 'The authorities we enacted after September 11, 2011 \u2014 which were crafted to ensure that we integrated intelligence gathered overseas and here in the United States \u2014 are acutely relevant now. We live in a dangerous world. Threats like ISIL only make it more so,' argued McConnell. His rhetoric is clearly one that elevates security interests as the end-all, but one can't help but question if bulk phone data collection without limit within the United States is 'the exact tools we need to combat ISIL.' There's also the argument to be made that securing the safety of a nation is vital, but once that government steps on the rights and privacy of its citizens, it makes an enemy of its civilian population and becomes a danger in itself. But that's assuming that bulk collection being regulated more stringently is integral to keeping the nation safe.<br/> The reality of the matter is \u2014 like any organization with a set of goals and obstacles \u2014 there are many tools and pathways to a good defense for America's intelligence organizations. And if Congress places obstacles in the way of the NSA in order to protect against over-surveillance of American citizens, it's not a zero-sum scenario where the NSA will become powerless if regulation is put in place \u2014 as McConnell's rhetoric seems to suggest.<br/>More Politics Cheat Sheet:<br/>Apple, Google, and Others Push Senate to Limit NSA Spying 2014 Election Guide: Will a GOP Senate Majority Let Congress Work?[2] Republicans Win: Is Obamacare as Good as Repealed?[3]<br/> Follow Anthea Mitchell on Twitter @AntheaWSCS[4]<br/> Want more great content like this?

He will be appearing at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.6degreesto.com/to-2019\">https://www.6degreesto.com/to-2019</url>/ .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A funny thing happened on the way to the 21st century: Even as old conspiracy theories were growing more implausible, they also became more popular.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take the Flat Earth: Never before in human history have more people seen the Earth's curvature with their own eyes.</p><p>From climate denial to anti-vax to a resurgent eugenics movement, we are in a golden age of terrible conspiratorial thinking, with real consequences for our species' continued survival on our (decidedly round) planet.</p><p>Ideas spread because of some mix of ideology and material circumstances. Either ideas are convincingly argued and/or they are delivered to people whose circumstances make them susceptible to those ideas.</p><p>Conspiracies aren't on the rise because the arguments for them got better. The arguments for \"alternative medicine\" or against accepted climate science are no better than those that have lurked in the fringes for generations. Look up the 19th-century skeptics who decried the smallpox vaccine and you'll find that anti-vax arguments have progressed very little in more than a century.</p><p>The people panicking over these developments have an explanation for the newfound vigour of conspiracy theories: They say the Big Tech platforms have developed the equivalent of mind-control rays that beam even mediocre ideas past our rational defences.</p><p>They say that ad-driven companies such as Google and Facebook threw so much R&amp;D at using data-mining to persuade people to buy refrigerators, subprime loans and fidget-spinners that they accidentally figured out how to rob us of our free will. These systems put our online history through a battery of psychological tests, automatically pick an approach that will convince us, then bombard us with an increasingly extreme, increasingly tailored series of pitches until we're convinced that creeping sharia and George Soros are coming for our children.</p><p>This belief is rooted in a deep and completely justified mistrust of the Big Tech companies, which have proven themselves liars time and again on matters of taxation, labour policy, complicity in state surveillance and oppression, and privacy practices.</p><p>But this well-founded skepticism is switched off when it comes to evaluating Big Tech's self-serving claims about the efficacy of its products. Exhibit A for the Mind-Control Ray theory of conspiratorial thinking is the companies' own sales literature, wherein they boast to potential customers about the devastating impact of their products, which, they say, are every bit as terrific as the critics fear they are.</p><p>Call me a cynic, but I don't know why we'd doubt every utterance from Big Tech except their marketing claims.</p><p>I just don't believe in mind control. The underlying science behind \"sentiment analysis,\" and \"big 5 personality type\" classifiers is (to put it charitably) hotly contested by research psychologists. And while the non-consensual dossiers that Big Tech has compiled on countless people certainly help them target people (that is, by showing fridge ads to people who've searched for refrigerator reviews, or by suggesting that people who hang out in white-supremacist-adjacent forums might want to send money to Faith Goldy or go to Charlottesville with a supply of tiki torches), there's not much evidence that Big Tech represents any meaningful advance on persuasion. Big Tech can find you people who might be amenable to your pitch, and can automate much of the record-keeping associated with refining that pitch, but the pitch itself? That's a stubbornly unscientific craft.</p><p>If conspiracies aren't attributable to ideology or mind-control rays, then we're left with one remaining possibility: that material circumstances of the people who believe in conspiracies made them vulnerable to bad ideas, even ones that are as implausible as eugenics, anti-vax and the flat Earth.</p><p>It's tempting to think that conspiracies represent a disagreement about what is true, but at root, they are a disagreement about how we know whether something is true or not. When we argue about the flat Earth, we're not just debating the shape of our planet: We're debating the method by which we can know its shape.</p><p>The modern way of knowing things for sure is through formal truth-seeking exercises. In these, an official body convenes a formal, transparent investigation into some question: how to calculate load-stresses on the joists that hold up our buildings; whether we should be eating more plants and fewer animals; whether a medication is safe. They hear from experts who present their best evidence and rebuttals. The bodies deliberate, and make a decision, and publish that decision, and explain their rationale.</p><p>These systems work because when they fail, they fail safe. The people involved are bound by ethics rules that keep them out of temptation's way; their work is on display so that any failures can be caught by third parties; the system is subject to appeal and repeal as new facts are revealed.</p><p>For these systems to work, they need to be fair and honest.</p><p>But 40 years of rising inequality and industry consolidation have turned our truth-seeking exercises into auctions, in which lawmakers, regulators and administrators are beholden to a small cohort of increasingly wealthy people who hold their financial and career futures in their hands. Industry consolidation makes it startlingly cheap to buy the truth: Once an industry consists of a handful of players, it's easy for everyone to agree on the play, and the only people qualified to be referees are drawn from the companies' own executive ranks, whence they will return after their spin in governance's revolving door.</p><p>Why don't we agree on the urgency of climate change? Because of a moneyed conspiracy to make us doubt it. Why did we let a single family amass riches greater than the Rockefellers while peddling OxyContin and claiming it wasn't addictive? Because of a moneyed conspiracy. Why do some 737s fall out of the sky? Why are our baby-bottles revealed to be lined with carcinogenic plastics? Why do corrupt companies get to profit by consorting with the world's most despicable dictators? Conspiracies.</p><p>In other words: Big Tech doesn't have a mind-control ray, but it does have an incredibly sophisticated people-finding machine, and if you're looking for people who might believe in your conspiracy, it helps if there's a massive pool of people around who've been battered (and had their lives irreparably harmed) by conspiracies.</p><p>To be in a world where the truth is up for auction is to be set adrift from rationality. No one is qualified to assess all the intensely technical truths required for survival: even if you can master media literacy and sort reputable scientific journals from junk pay-for-play ones; even if you can acquire the statistical literacy to evaluate studies for rigour; even if you can acquire the expertise to evaluate claims about the safety of opioids, you can't do it all over again for your city's building code, the aviation-safety standards governing your next flight, the food-safety standards governing the dinner you just ordered.</p><p>In such a world, you're left nominating experts to tell you which claims are accurate and which ones aren't. I believe in the medical science about vaccines because of trusted scientist friends; I disbelieve the (waning) medical claims about opioid safety for the same reason. But my epidemiologist friends have no expertise when it comes to structural steel, diesel emissions or climate science.</p><p>In a pluralistic world, we can aspire to the rule of law, in which rigorous systems keep human frailty in check. In an oligarchic world, we're left finding people who \"sound like they know what they're talking about\" and putting our trust in them. If your people tell you that opioids are killing you (and possibly save your life in the process) and then follow it up by telling you that the Earth is flat or that George Soros wants to weaken your social fabric by funding asylum seekers and paid protesters, well, what yardstick can you measure these statements against?</p><p>Big Tech is part of this problem, but not because they have a mind-control ray. Rather, it's because they have monopolies, thanks to decades of buying nascent competitors and merging with their largest competitors, of cornering vertical markets and crushing rivals who won't sell. Big Tech means that one company is in charge of the social lives of 2.3 billion people; it means another company controls the way we answer every question it occurs to us to ask. It means that companies can assert the right to control which software your devices can run, who can fix them, and when they must be sent to a landfill.</p><p>These companies, with their tax evasion, labour abuses, cavalier attitudes toward our privacy and their completely ordinary human frailty and self-deception, are unfit to rule our lives. But no one is fit to be our ruler. We deserve technological self-determination, not a corporatized internet made up of five giant services each filled with screenshots from the other four.</p><p>It's hard to seize the means of computation, but step one is ending oligarchic controls. We need breakups of all our consolidated industries: energy, transport, accountancy and auditing, entertainment, telecoms, media, news, tech - everything from eyeglasses to pro wrestling to movie studios to pharmacies (to say nothing of pharmaceutical companies!).</p><p>We can never be sure whether our beliefs are true ones, but unless we can look where the evidence leads us - even when it gores a billionaire's ox - our beliefs will tend toward catastrophic falsity.</p><p>Keep your Opinions sharp and informed.

Or if every website were full of racial slurs, conspiracy theories, and fake accounts. Parental control tools could no longer prevent your kids from seeing such heinous content. If that sounds like the Internet you've always wanted, then you'll love Republicans' new 'Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act[1]' and 'Online Content Policy Modernization Act[2]!'</p><p> In 1996, Congress agreed, almost unanimously, that users, websites, and filtering tool developers shouldn't face such legal risks and that it was imperative 'to remove disincentives for the development and utilization of blocking and filtering technologies.' That's why Congress enacted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. But a few weeks ago, after yet another Trump tweet[3] raging about 'biased Big Tech,' three Republican Senators rushed to introduce legislation that would turn the law on its head. Sen. Lindsay Graham followed suit with his own bill that would do essentially the same thing. Trump's Department of Justice has proposed[4] to gut Section 230. Never mind that Section 230 was authored by a Republican congressman who still defends[5] the law. Today, Section 230 broadly protects users, websites, and developers of filtering tools (built into operating systems, search engines, or services like YouTube \u2014 or that you can install yourself) when they exercise their First Amendment rights to decide what content or users to block or 'restrict access' to. This new bill would sharply curtail such content moderation. To avoid liability, a defendant would have to prove the content was 'obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, promoting self-harm, promoting terrorism, or unlawful.' That covers only a fraction of the Internet's awfulness. Even the vilest statements could not be removed or filtered unless tied to the harassment of specific users or the clear glorification of violence. The bill doesn't cover spam, fake accounts, clear hate speech, or clear misinformation. That last exclusion is intentional: it was Twitter's timid moves in May to put warning labels on Trump's tweets about mail-in voting that quickly led the White House to issue an executive order[6] calling for legislation to 'reform' Section 230. Republicans aim to stop content moderation for 'political' reasons. But it would invite litigation over even truly neutral restrictions. Nextdoor.com limits[7] discussion of national political issues to special 'groups,' so that the site can focus on hyper-local issues. But the bill would no longer protect such segmentation. If a medical school wanted to keep its students focused on studying science rather than arguing about politics, enforcing that rule wouldn't be protected either. Republicans complain about 'Big Tech,' but their bill would expose everyone to lawsuits. Trump himself has invoked[8] Section 230 to avoid liability for retweeting allegedly defamatory material. FoxNews.com reserves[9] the right to block 'offensive[10]' comments on its site, as Breitbart.com does for 'inappropriate[11]' content. Even Parler, the conservative 'free speech' alternative to Facebook reserves broad discretion to remove any content that they consider 'disruptive[12]' or that creates 'risk[13]' (not just legal risk) for Parler.  Section 230 protects not just the providers but users engaged in content moderation \u2014 such as those who manage Facebook pages and groups. Reddit relies[14] on users to moderate its 130,000 'subreddit' communities, while the English Wikipedia depends[15] on 1,131 volunteer administrators to resolve conflicts. Would you volunteer if you knew you could be sued by disgruntled users? Republican proposals would open the door to creative plaintiffs' lawyers to sue anyone who feels aggrieved for being 'censored.' Yet it won't do what Republicans want most: allow the FTC, Republican state attorneys general, and MAGA activists to sue 'Big Tech' for 'deceiving' consumers by not delivering political 'neutrality' as (supposedly) promised. The reason consumer protection agencies have never brought such suits, and courts have tossed out private lawsuits, isn't Section 230. Back in 2004, left-wing activists petitioned the FTC to sanction Fox News for not delivering on its 'Fair and Balanced' slogan. The Republican FTC Chairman dismissed[16] the petition pithily: 'There is no way to evaluate this petition without evaluating the content of the news at issue. That is a task the First Amendment leaves to the American people, not a government agency.' Offline or online, the courts simply won't adjudicate questions of media bias because they're inherently subjective. Section 230's protections are vital to the Internet, where both users and providers make editorial decisions about content created by third parties at a scale and speed that are simply unfathomable in the world of traditional publishing. This new bill attempts to use Section 230's indispensability to coerce the surrender of First Amendment rights. That violates the 'unconstitutional conditions' doctrine. In 1969, the Supreme Court upheld[17] imposing special 'Fairness Doctrine' conditions on broadcast licenses only because it denied broadcasters full First Amendment protection. But the Court has repeatedly said that new media providers enjoy the same free speech rights[18] as traditional publishers \u2014 and has struck down fairness mandates on newspapers as unconstitutional[19]. Republicans fought the Fairness Doctrine for decades. Their 2016 platform[20] demanded 'free-market approaches to free speech unregulated by government.' Yet now they want an even more arbitrary Fairness Doctrine for the Internet. They should remember what President Reagan said when he ended the original Fairness Doctrine in 1987: 'the dangers of an overly timid or biased press cannot be averted through bureaucratic regulation, but only through the freedom and competition that the First Amendment sought to guarantee.' If, despite a lack of any solid evidence, conservatives persist in believing that social media are biased against them, they should vote against it with their clicks and dollars. Switch to Parler, if you like. Just don't be surprised when you find content like this on the site:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/jc3bFbtBy\">https://imgur.com/jc3bFbtBy</url> comparison, #Section230 has 262 'parleys' (posts) \u2014 roughly 20% as many as #JEWS). And this is just the tip of a very large iceberg that includes 'parleys' like this[21] (note the gruesomely pro-Holocaust account name:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/X58EMehParler\">https://imgur.com/X58EMehParler</url> has chosen not to remove such content \u2014 but Section 230 would protect the site if it did. Not so if Republicans got their way. Let that sink in. When Republicans complain about 'hate speech' being used as an excuse for censoring conservatives, this is among the content they're saying should stay up. Because... 'bias.' Ironically, Parler has engaged in selective moderation of hate speech to make the site seem just respectable enough to attract Republican politicians like Sens. Ted Cruz, Sen. Rand Paul, and Rep. Devin Nunes. The site clearly blocks any variant of the n-word in hashtags \u2014 which are wildly popular on Gab, which Parler has rapidly eclipsed as the 'free speech' network. Gab offers a clear picture of what social media would look like if Republicans succeeded in narrowing Section 230's protections. This is what an 'uncensored' Internet looks like:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/ArRKygTIf\">https://imgur.com/ArRKygTIf</url> anything, it's difficult to appreciate how widespread such content is on both Parler and Gab because, unlike Facebook and Twitter, they only allow users to search hashtags (and names of users and groups), not the contents of posts. But one thing's clear: while Parler blocks the n-word in hashtags, they definitely don't block it in posts. Is this really what Sens. Wicker, Blackburn and Hawley really want the Internet to look like? Do they really believe Section 230 shouldn't protect websites when they remove such heinous content? I asked Sen. Blackburn's counsel about this. He claimed that removing such content would still be covered by Section 230 because it would fall into the category of 'harassing' content already explicitly protected by Section 230. That's certainly not what the Trump administration thinks. The NTIA's petition to have the FCC rewrite Section 230 defines 'harassing' content as having the 'subjective intent to abuse, threaten, or harass any specific person.' You don't have to be a lawyer to see how narrow that definition is. If a neo-Nazi posts something like #NiggersAreAPlagueOfTheJew as a reply to a black or Jewish user, yes, that might qualify as 'harassing,' but simply ranting about both in his own posts would not be directed at any specific person \u2014 so websites wouldn't be protected for removing it. The staffer insisted that his boss doesn't take such a narrow view of what should qualify as 'harassing,' but it's hard to see why any court would take a broader view than what NTIA proposes. In any event, what Members or their staff say they intend is irrelevant; what matters is the plain text of the statute. If they want to make their intention clear, they need to pick other words and put them in the statute. More importantly, hate speech is just one category of noxious content that websites could be sued for removing, hiding or labeling if Republicans have their way. The same goes for conspiracy theories, misinformation about COVID, vaccines, and voting, etc. For example:<url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/RkjmAwR\">https://imgur.com/RkjmAwR</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://imgur.com/7zA2h9jBlackburn\">https://imgur.com/7zA2h9jBlackburn</url>'s counsel claimed that moderating anti-vaccination misinformation could be covered by the term 'promoting self-harm.' Again, that's a huge legal stretch \u2014 especially because the 'harm' at issue here is primarily not to the 'self' but to the children of parents duped by anti-vax content, and to those in society who get infected because vaccination rates fall below levels needed to achieve herd immunity. Even if a court decided that the term might cover some anti-vax content, websites would have to fight it out in court, and courts might rule differently in different cases. If you want those things for yourself and your children, go to Gab or Parler. Just, please, stop trying to turn the rest of social media into those sites. And don't complain when those sites fail to attract advertising. What respectable brand in America would want to advertise its products next to such content? President Reagan's answer would have been clear: private companies should be free to make their own decisions, especially when the alternative is a true cesspool of everything that is worst about humanity. Sadly, today's Republicans don't seem to care about anything beyond making political hay out of repeating the same baseless claims that they're being persecuted. Hashtag: #Snowflakes.

But it's premature to conclude that won't change as the public learns details of Trump's effort to get Ukraine to investigate potential 2020 election rival Joe Biden. If the president's approval rating takes a beating from Trump impeachment developments while odds soar that Elizabeth Warren wins the Democratic nomination, political risk will grow and stocks could suffer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment, Trump's job approval rating is close to a two-and-a-half year high. RealClearPolitics puts the Trump approval rating at 44.9%, while FiveThirtyEight, which adjusts polls based on methodology and reliability, has it at 42.9%.</p><p>If either of those numbers falls to 40% or below, that is likely to begin to shake investor confidence in Trump's reelection prospects.</p><h>Does Dow Jones Even Want Trump Reelected?</h><p>Wall Street has a love-hate relationship with Trump. Investors hate his China tariffs. Yet the China trade war may not come to a neat end if Trump loses in 2020. Investors tend to like the positive earnings impact from his big spending and anti-regulation policies. And they love his tax cuts \u2014 particularly his corporate tax cut, which shrunk the effective tax rate for S&amp;P 500 companies by one-third.</p><p>Given that economic growth already looks somewhat fragile, rising 2020 election odds that a Democrat will win the White House and potentially have the chance to reverse that corporate tax cut won't go over well on Wall Street.</p><p>Democrats also would need to pick up at least three Senate seats and hold the House to repeal tax cuts or pass other major legislation. Yet if Trump's approval sinks below 40%, a Democratic Senate takeover may look more likely.</p><h>Trump Impeachment Odds Soar</h><p>Unlike public opinion polls that move with a time lag, political betting markets react almost immediately. Of course, betting markets can be wrong and aren't all that liquid. Still, they may have some value in handicapping the future, and Wall Street keeps an eye on them.</p><p>The PredictIt market showed odds that House Democrats will impeach Trump during his first term surged above 60% on Wednesday. That happened as the White House released a loose transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. Trump impeachment odds had been stuck around 25% just a week earlier.</p><h>Trump Reelection Odds Are Stable</h><p>While Trump impeachment suddenly looks likely, Trump 2020 election odds have yet to show much, if any, movement.</p><p>Based on bets placed at PredictIt and Betfair, Democrats have 53% odds of winning the White House. That's according to the  site from Microsoft economist David Rothschild.</p><p>That stability may indicate an expectation by market participants that Trump impeachment won't cost him many votes. That seems plausible, given the highly polarized state of politics.\u00a0Yet investors might consider another possible explanation, because Trump impeachment isn't the only political bet with surging odds.</p><h>Warren Is Now Big Favorite Over Biden For Democratic Nomination</h><p>Suddenly, betting markets see Elizabeth Warren as a huge favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Odds of a Biden victory are crumbling, at least according to political betting markets.</p><p>PredictWise calculates her odds of winning the Democratic nomination at 53% vs. 17% for Joe Biden. RealClearPolitics places Warren's odds at 47% vs. 22% for Biden.</p><p>While Warren has been the betting markets favorite for some time, RealClearPolitics shows that her advantage over Biden has doubled over the past week, from about 12 points to 25 points. That partly reflects some actual polls showing Warren ahead of Biden nationally and in first-to-vote Iowa.</p><p>One might expect that the significant shift in the Democratic race toward Warren would boost Trump's reelection odds. That's because polls have consistently showed that \u00a0in the 2020 election \u2014 by far. The September IBD/TIPP Poll had Biden with a 12-point advantage over Trump, while Warren outpolled Trump by just 3 points.</p><h>Warren A Big Dow Jones Risk</h><p>Take the evidence from political betting markets with a huge grain of salt. Yet the overall message for Wall Street is the 2020 election odds of a left-wing Democrat winning the White House have surged amid the Trump impeachment push.</p><p>Handing Warren the keys to corporate regulation would surely make Wall Street nervous. She's best known for wanting to break up big banks \u2014 and big tech. While neither goal may be likely, it's fair to assume that Warren would be more negative for corporate earnings than Biden.</p><p>Butm for now, the\u00a0The Dow Jones Industrial Average is within 2% of all-time highs.</p><p>Please follow Jed Graham on Twitter  for insight on economic policy and financial markets.</p><p>YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:</p><p/><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-5014735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4S-VM11-DYTD-93VS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

This fall, she could become the next vice president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That presents a big problem for Facebook. Warren, who is on the short list to be Joe Biden's running mate, is seen as one of the few impact picks, able to bring over disillusioned supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders. She routinely tops the list in polls asking voters whom they want to see nominated, with a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> poll Friday showing her with the highest approval rating among respondents, at 45 percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While a vice president takes his or her cues on administration priorities from the president, Warren's selection could be a setback for the powerful company, which already faces accusations that it placates President Donald Trump as well as antitrust issues in Europe. Facebook and Warren have launched broadsides at each other, as they did in October, when audio leaked of CEO Mark Zuckerberg telling his employees he would sue the government if Warren tried to break up his company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With Biden's VP decision weeks away, sources who've worked with the company and Democrats told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> that Facebook would prefer to see anyone but Warren on the ticket.</p><p>\"I don't think they'd like it,\" said a source with ties to Facebook, who asked for anonymity in order to discuss sensitive company matters. \"The question is, If Biden wins, will they have the same animus?\"</p><p>Citing the \"integrity of our elections,\" Biden told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis> during the primary that the country hasn't spent enough time focusing on antitrust measures and said reining in major corporations, including Big Tech, needs a hard look. But he did not mention Facebook.</p><p>Asked whether the social network is concerned about Warren as vice president, Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>, \"I don't think we would weigh in on the VP pick.\"</p><p>During the spring and summer of 2019, Warren campaigned on her plan to break up Big Tech companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google, which would include rolling back major acquisitions like Facebook's deals for Instagram and WhatsApp. Known during the primary as the candidate with a plan for everything, Warren wasn't shy about touting this one, putting up a large billboard in San Francisco, where many Facebook employees live, that said \"Break Up Big Tech\" in block letters under her name.</p><p>In October, leaked audio emerged of Zuckerberg's response to that idea: He made it clear he saw Warren as an \"existential\" threat to the company and floated a lawsuit.</p><p>\"I would bet that we will win the legal challenge,\" he said. \"Does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.... But look, at the end of the day if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\"</p><p>Warren hit back on Twitter. \"What would really 'suck' is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy,\" she wrote.</p><p>\"There's no doubt in my mind that Big Tech and Wall Street\u2013friendly interests are worried about Warren,\" said Democratic strategist Murshed Zaheed, who backs her for vice president. He said Biden's invocations of Franklin D. Roosevelt, architect of the New Deal during the Great Depression, as a model for his presidency should also worry Facebook.</p><p>\"Biden has talked about a presidency that will have an FDR approach, and Warren would be his best partner and best situated to help him achieve that vision, which would include reining in Big Tech interests,\" Zaheed added. \"Naturally, Facebook would take note of that.\"</p><p>The source with ties to Facebook said much would hinge on whether Democrats win the Senate in November. If not, they would be focused on regulatory fixes, and their eye could turn to the social network.</p><p>Democratic leaders have become increasingly emboldened in criticizing Facebook. Biden this month released an open letter calling on the company to \"promote real news, not fake news\"; \"quickly remove viral misinformation\"; enforce voter suppression rules on everyone, including Trump; and institute a policy that would have Facebook fact-check political ads in the two weeks before an election to stop disinformation from affecting the outcome. In May 2019, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was reportedly furious when a manipulated video of her went viral on the network.</p><p>The social media giant appears torn about how to address its political problems. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> columnist Ben Smith said this week that leaders were \"having an internal debate over balancing the reality of Republican control of regulatory agencies with the fact that Democrats are far more likely, in the long run, to actually push through new oversight or try to break up the company by forcing the sale of Instagram or WhatsApp.\"</p><p>Warren responded to the column by tweeting, \"Facebook is too big and has too much power\u2014and Mark Zuckerberg's uninterrogated and unaccountable relationship with Trump is a danger to our democracy.\"</p><p>The hits keep coming for the digital behemoth. On Thursday, Verizon became the largest company to join a boycott of Facebook advertising for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms. Brad Bauman, the former executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> the move is one reason Facebook is likely not focused on the veepstakes.</p><p>\"Facebook has so many problems right now that they're not even thinking in that direction,\" Bauman said. \"It's clear they're stomping out so many fires.\"</p><p>Warren's case to be the vice presidential nominee has had to weather a powerful political moment, with protests about police brutality against African Americans leading Democrats to call for a black woman to be the running mate. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> poll from Friday had Senator Kamala Harris, who is Black, second in favorability among voters. Asked by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Times</emphasis> about breaking up Big Tech, Harris said, \"My first priority is going to be that we ensure that privacy is something that is intact.\"</p><p>So it is Warren who stands out as the Democrat whose possible political ascent Facebook is watching closely.</p><p>\"I would hope Mark Zuckerberg is doing a lot of soul-searching on the role his company plays in spreading disinformation in our democracy and the responsibility he has,\" said Jonathan Jayes-Green, former Latinx outreach director for Warren's campaign. \"My hope is that regardless who the VP is, there's a process of accountability around Facebook.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1603987/warren-break-facebook.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>warren break up facebook</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Justin Sullivan/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>The presidential campaign for U.S. Sen.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, the staff had recommended a major fine: \"The 160-page critique, which was supposed to remain private but was inadvertently disclosed in an open-records request, concluded that Google's 'conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to consumers.' \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Google was never penalized because the political appointees overrode the staff recommendation, an action rarely taken by the FTC. The Journal pointed out that Google, whose executives donated more money to the Obama campaign than any company, had held scores of meetings at the White House between the time the staff filed its report and the ultimate decision to drop the enforcement action.</p><p> This week, the European Union's antitrust authorities fined Google a record $2.7 billion for the exact same sort of infractions that the FTC staff had been reviewing. Why were Europeans more willing to combat Big Tech monopolies than Americans? The answer lies in both the way libertarian economic thinking has changed American views of antitrust and in the problem of regulatory capture. Has Google gotten so big that both politicians and regulators are scared of the tech giant?</p><p>Google has 88 percent market share in search and search-related advertising. It is clearly a monopoly, and it acts like one: As one of the complainants in both the FTC and E.U. cases, Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman testified in September of 2011 before the Senate antitrust subcommittee: \"Google first began taking our content without permission a year ago. Despite public and private protests, Google gave the ultimatum that only a monopolist can give: In order to appear in web search you must allow us to use your content to compete against you.\"</p><p> The common legal view of antitrust, as enumerated by Justice Louis Brandeis in his 1934 paper, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" was framed around protecting the smaller business from the predations of the giant firm. As Brandeis wrote, \"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"</p><p> But in the early 1980s, the Reagan administration adopted a new view of antitrust as laid out by Robert Bork in his book, \"The Antitrust Paradox.\" Bork felt that if a merger did not result in higher prices, then it could be justified, even if it seemed to eliminate competition. Of course in the digital age, where Moore's Law leads to lower prices and many ad-supported services seemed free to the consumer, it was almost impossible, using the Bork rule, to stop Google's acquisition of YouTube or Double Click - services that led to Google's current domination. Bork's approach has continued through Republican and Democratic administrations.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal investigation of the dropped FTC action helps explain why. Google's political capture of the Washington power structure is key to the reluctance of American regulators to bring the company to heel. The Journal reported 230 meetings between Google executives and the White House in the 2012-2013 period. In addition, as the Google Transparency Project has shown, 31 Google officials joined the Obama White House, executive-branch agencies or federal advisory boards.</p><p> Even though former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's candidate Hillary Clinton lost the election, his willingness to flatter the Trump administration was on full display last week at the White House Tech Summit. \"I'm absolutely convinced that during your administration there is going to be a huge explosion of new opportunities because of the platforms that are getting built in our industry. It's going to happen soon during your leadership,\" Schmidt said to Trump after the meeting, as over a dozen CEOs went around the table praising the president.</p><p> Clearly, the Europeans are not quite as in thrall to the tech moguls as the Americans. Ever since Bill Gates and Steve Jobs dominated the covers of business magazines, both politicians and journalists have lived in what Apple employees described as a \"reality distortion field.\" Men like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg are among the richest people on the planet because they understood that in an unregulated business like the Internet it was going to be a winner-takes-all game. Scale economics and the network effect (I want to be on a social network where all of my friends are) create single dominant firms in search, social networks and e-commerce. Clearly there is no market solution to Google's monopoly. No venture capitalist is going to finance a Google killer.</p><p> Which leaves government regulators. The Europeans seem to be more resistant to Google's lobbying power, perhaps because they have far more restrictive campaign finance laws. In addition, Europeans have been far more skeptical about the surveillance capitalism that Google and Facebook practice, in which your every move is part of their data record of your life. (Witness the \"right to be forgotten,\" a European legal innovation.) One could imagine a politician like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, raised under their constant surveillance of East Germany's Stasi secret police, being rather offended by Google's ad tech following her everywhere on the Web, just because she admired a pair of shoes. The next few months may show how the Internet monopolies react to this first salvo of regulation. Eventually, American regulators may even join the fight.</p><p> Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, is the author of \"Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNY-170630107512105</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289AEC5D7B5A36 NWBKNY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3D-NB01-DXVP-V1R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399552</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Johnson Newspaper Corporation<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

As the Wall Street Journal reported, the staff had recommended an enforcement action: \"The 160-page critique, which was supposed to remain private but was inadvertently disclosed in an open-records request, concluded that Google's 'conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to consumers.' \"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the political appointees overrode the staff recommendation, an action rarely taken by the FTC (though at the same time they won concessions from Google to cease key anti-competitive behaviors). The Journal pointed out that Google, whose executives donated more money to the Obama campaign than any company, had held scores of meetings at the White House between the time the staff filed its report and the ultimate decision to drop the enforcement action.</p><p>This week, the European Union's antitrust authorities fined Google a record $2.7 billion for the exact same sort of infractions that the FTC staff had been reviewing. Why were Europeans more willing to combat Big Tech monopolies than Americans? The answer lies in both the way libertarian economic thinking has changed American views of antitrust and in the problem of regulatory capture. Has Google gotten so big that both politicians and regulators are scared of the tech giant?</p><p>Google has 88 percent market share in search and search-related advertising. It is clearly a monopoly, and it acts like one: As one of the complainants in both the FTC and E.U. cases, Yelp chief executive Jeremy Stoppelman testified in September of 2011 before the Senate antitrust subcommittee: \"Google first began taking our content without permission a year ago. Despite public and private protests, Google gave the ultimatum that only a monopolist can give: In order to appear in web search you must allow us to use your content to compete against you.\"</p><p>The common legal view of antitrust, as enumerated by Justice Louis Brandeis in his 1934 paper, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" was framed around protecting the smaller business from the predations of the giant firm. As Brandeis wrote, \"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"</p><p>But in the early 1980s, the Reagan administration adopted a new view of antitrust as laid out by Robert Bork in his book, \"The Antitrust Paradox.\" Bork felt that if a merger did not result in higher prices, then it could be justified, even if it seemed to eliminate competition. Of course in the digital age, where Moore's Law leads to lower prices and many ad-supported services seemed free to the consumer, it was almost impossible, using the Bork rule, to stop Google's acquisition of YouTube or Double Click - services that led to Google's current domination. Bork's approach has continued through Republican and Democratic administrations.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal investigation of the dropped FTC action helps explain why. Google's political capture of the Washington power structure is key to the reluctance of American regulators to bring the company to heel. The Journal reported 230 meetings between Google executives and the White House in the 2012-2013 period. In addition, as the Google Transparency Project has shown, 31 Google officials joined the Obama White House, executive-branch agencies or federal advisory boards.</p><p>Even though former Google CEO Eric Schmidt's candidate Hillary Clinton lost the election, his willingness to flatter the Trump administration was on full display last week at the White House Tech Summit. \"I'm absolutely convinced that during your administration there is going to be a huge explosion of new opportunities because of the platforms that are getting built in our industry. It's going to happen soon during your leadership,\" Schmidt said to Trump after the meeting, as over a dozen CEOs went around the table praising the president.</p><p>Clearly, the Europeans are not quite as in thrall to the tech moguls as the Americans. Ever since Bill Gates and Steve Jobs dominated the covers of business magazines, both politicians and journalists have lived in what Apple employees described as a \"reality distortion field.\" Men like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg are among the richest people on the planet because they understood that in an unregulated business like the Internet it was going to be a winner-takes-all game. Scale economics and the network effect (I want to be on a social network where all of my friends are) create single dominant firms in search, social networks and e-commerce. Clearly there is no market solution to Google's monopoly. No venture capitalist is going to finance a Google killer.</p><p>Which leaves government regulators. The Europeans seem to be more resistant to Google's lobbying power, perhaps because they have far more restrictive campaign finance laws. In addition, Europeans have been far more skeptical about the surveillance capitalism that Google and Facebook practice, in which your every move is part of their data record of your life. (Witness the \"right to be forgotten,\" a European legal innovation.) One could imagine a politician like German Chancellor Angela Merkel, raised under their constant surveillance of East Germany's Stasi secret police, being rather offended by Google's ad tech following her everywhere on the Web, just because she admired a pair of shoes. The next few months may show how the Internet monopolies react to this first salvo of regulation. Eventually, American regulators may even join the fight.</p><p>          [CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to more accurately describe the FTC's investigation and decision about Google in 2012 and 2013.]       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-208de60678bd4a9dafbf566f2f6512bd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NWT-2Y61-JB4M-V23P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"966\"/><timeReceived>1:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 28, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

As the Wall Street Journal reported, the staff had recommended a major fine: \"The 160-page critique, which was supposed to remain private but was inadvertently disclosed in an open-records request, concluded that Google's 'conduct has resulted - and will result - in real harm to consumers.' \"</p><p>But Google was never penalized because the political appointees overrode the staff recommendation, an action rarely taken by the FTC. The Journal pointed out that Google, whose executives donated more money to the Obama campaign than any company, had held scores of meetings at the White House between the time the staff filed its report and the ultimate decision to drop the enforcement action.</p><p>Last week, the European Union's antitrust authorities fined Google a record $2.7 billion for the exact same sort of infractions that the FTC staff had been reviewing. Why were Europeans more willing to combat Big Tech monopolies than Americans? The answer lies in both the way libertarian economic thinking has changed American views of antitrust and in the problem of regulatory capture. Has Google gotten so big that both politicians and regulators are scared of the tech giant?</p><p>Google has 88 percent market share in search and search-related advertising. It is clearly a monopoly, and it acts like one: As one of the complainants in both the FTC and E.U. cases, Yelp Chief Executive Jeremy Stoppelman testified in September of 2011 before the Senate antitrust subcommittee: \"Google first began taking our content without permission a year ago. Despite public and private protests, Google gave the ultimatum that only a monopolist can give: In order to appear in web search you must allow us to use your content to compete against you.\"</p><p>The common legal view of antitrust, as enumerated by Justice Louis Brandeis in his 1934 paper, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" was framed around protecting the smaller business from the predations of the giant firm. As Brandeis wrote, \"We can have democracy in this country, or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we can't have both.\"</p><p>But in the early 1980s, the Reagan administration adopted a new view of antitrust as laid out by Robert Bork in his book, \"The Antitrust Paradox.\" Bork felt that if a merger did not result in higher prices, then it could be justified, even if it seemed to eliminate competition. Of course in the digital age, where Moore's Law leads to lower prices and many ad-supported services seemed free to the consumer, it was almost impossible, using the Bork rule, to stop Google's acquisition of YouTube or Double Click - services that led to Google's current domination. Bork's approach has continued through Republican and Democratic administrations.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal investigation of the dropped FTC action helps explain why. Google's political capture of the Washington power structure is key to the reluctance of American regulators to bring the company to heel. The Journal reported 230 meetings between Google executives and the White House in the 2012-2013 period. In addition, as the Google Transparency Project has shown, 31 Google officials joined the Obama White House, executive-branch agencies or federal advisory boards.</p><p>Clearly, the Europeans are not quite as in thrall to the tech moguls as the Americans. Ever since Bill Gates and Steve Jobs dominated the covers of business magazines, both politicians and journalists have lived in what Apple employees described as a \"reality distortion field.\" Men like Larry Page and Mark Zuckerberg are among the richest people on the planet because they understood that in an unregulated business like the internet it was going to be a winner-takes-all game. Scale economics and the network effect (I want to be on a social network where all of my friends are) create single dominant firms in search, social networks and e-commerce. Clearly there is no market solution to Google's monopoly. No venture capitalist is going to finance a Google killer.</p><p>Which leaves government regulators. The Europeans seem to be more resistant to Google's lobbying power, perhaps because they have far more restrictive campaign finance laws. In addition, Europeans have been far more skeptical about the surveillance capitalism that Google and Facebook practice, in which your every move is part of their data record of your life. The next few months may show how the Internet monopolies react to this first salvo of regulation. Eventually, American regulators may even join the fight.</p><p>Taplin is the author of \"Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-520687</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NXK-NDR1-JBM5-P1KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 2, 2017 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkM1MTYwRDE0NkJBNEVFMEIxQjM3RUE2NDRFQUFEODY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode><className>Federal Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CC</classCode><className>COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF45</classCode><className>ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001373</classCode><className>PRICE CHANGES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLGK</classCode><className>PUBLIC RECORDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CZVS</classCode><className>CONSUMER RATINGS &amp;

Apple, Google, and Facebook have all come under scrutiny for various reasons including the taxes they pay in Europe, privacy concerns, and potential unfair business practices.</p><p>In March, the bloc hit Google with a third antitrust penalty, ordering it to pay ?1.5 billion for abusing its dominant position in online search advertising. It has fined Google a total of ?8.2 billion since 2017.</p><p>Now it is Amazon's turn in the crosshairs. Last week Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission's top antitrust official, said she would examine whether the online retailer's use of data violates competition rules. \"I have decided to take a very close look at Amazon's business practices and its dual role as marketplace and retailer to assess its compliance with EU competition rules,\" she said.</p><p>Vestager said e-commerce provides greater choice for consumers, but cautioned that regulators need to ensure that large online platforms don't indulge in anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>But some suspect hitting Amazon over how it uses data could be a pretext for finding a way to slow the juggernaut. Critics say Amazon could have a devastating impact on traditional small retailers and even large stores in Europe.</p><p>As well, many workers and unions in Europe chafe at its high-pressure employment environment. Strikes have broken out at Amazon warehouses in Spain, Germany, the UK, and other countries as workers call for better working conditions, pay, and health benefits.</p><p>The labour protests highlight a growing challenge to Amazon in Europe. It faces increased scrutiny at a time when it is looking to add thousands of new warehouse workers and is growing at breakneck speed.</p><p>As European labour unions are mulling over their options, the EU's antitrust regulator is looking to possibly rein in the company over suspected violations in the arcane world of data collection and use. Though murky to the layman, how digital data is used has huge repercussions in the real world.</p><p>In the case of Amazon, data collected through its own search box gives it an advantage that could be exploited.</p><p>The European Commission, the administrative arm of the bloc's government, will investigate standard agreements between Amazon and independent merchants who sell on the platform. More than 130,000 small and medium-sized independent EU retailers sell goods on Amazon, but some claim the tech giant could itself have moved into bestselling products that small retailers discovered.</p><p>\"Amazon is a big beast that is trading on its own behalf as well as offering small and medium-sized retailers a shop in their store,\" James Dunford-Wood from e-commerce data specialist Ometria, told The Guardian newspaper.</p><p>The EU investigation that could go on for years exposes Amazon to potential fines of up to 10 per cent of its annual global sales, a levy of $23 billion based on 2018 revenues. But whatever fines are imposed - the EU has now fined or imposed tax bills totalling nearly ?25 billion on US tech giants - the real story will likely still be played out in the actual world of business.</p><p>Natalie Berg, co-author of a book about Amazon that labels it the world's most relentless retailer, says the online giant still faces solid European competition in the hard-knock world of retailing. \"Europe is still a priority but it's becoming tougher for Amazon,\" Berg says.</p><p>\"They've always been up against fiercer online competition, particularly in apparel, but now they're also contending with the resurgence of brick-and-mortar retail. Fashion retailers are distancing themselves from Amazon's utilitarian image by becoming more experiential while also leveraging their best assets - their stores.\"</p><p>Europe has long proved, it is no slouch in business and generating wealth. Bernard Arnault, chairman and CEO of the world's largest maker of luxury goods, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, recently surpassed Microsoft's Bill Gates as the world's second-richest man. But the No. 1 spot belongs to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos with a net worth of $124 billion, though some estimates put his fortune much higher.</p><p>Despite claims Europe might be moving toward protectionism, it seems a good idea to keep a close eye on Amazon. Bezos probably didn't climb to the very top by always playing fair.</p><p>Jon Van Housen and Mariella Radaelli are editors at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.luminosityitalia.com\">www.luminosityitalia.com</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-149674663</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM5-9GK1-F11P-X4PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"813\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

Congress has talked about regulating the tech giants without taking action. In Europe, it's a different story. Just before Christmas, the European Union's highest court issued a ruling against Uber. European courts have also said that Google has to remove some search results at a person's request. It's known as the right to be forgotten. To talk with us about why Europe is regulating these tech companies more aggressively than the U.S., Jonathan Zittrain joins us now. He's a professor of law and computer science at Harvard. Welcome.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Hello.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Do you see these as isolated examples, or do you think it is generally true that Europe is more willing to regulate these big tech companies than the U.S. is?             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 I think as a general rule, the Europeans are more willing to regulate full stop. There's just a general appetite for regulation and a trust in government perhaps to do it right that may not culturally exist as much in the United States.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 So I gave a couple of examples related to Uber and Google. The big tech giants also include Facebook, Amazon, Apple. Do you also see steps to regulate those companies?             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Yes. And I think it's - it maybe stems from the earliest days when the Internet went mainstream. I think late-'90s, early 2000s with the dot-com boom, there was some sense possibly, globally, about not wanting to kill the goose laying golden eggs. But we've had a number of eggs now. Not all of them appear to be golden. And there is some willingness now to do something about it. And of course for the Europeans, we see some sense that these aren't their own companies.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 They are companies from another country. And the fact that, well, maybe it will end up helping European competition might not be entirely absent from their thinking, too.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Give us an example of how one of these steps that Europe is taking might affect an Internet user in their daily lives.             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Well, the right to be forgotten that you mentioned is not a bad example. That's an instance where under an old regime from 1995, a Data Protection Directive, the European courts held that European citizens have a right if there is information that is, quote, \"no longer relevant\" about them - say, inside a search engine - they have an ability to make the case to that search engine - say, Google - that their name should no longer be linked with a particular set of results that they find embarrassing or unwanted.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 I've actually Googled things when I'm in Europe. And with the results, it says at the bottom of the page, some results may be missing as a result of this right to be forgotten ruling.             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Well, it turns out that that kind of remedy might have been too clever by half because of course if you tell people there's something they don't know about a specific search, that's giving them a big hint that they should roll up their sleeves and start searching more. So those exact notices won't appear when there is something specifically missing. But there are general notifications that say you're in a regime where there may be less stuff than there might otherwise be.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 This is obviously a subjective question. But in your opinion, are European regulators being overzealous, or are American regulators falling down on the job?             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Well, I think it's possible to say yes to both of those. In the case of Europe, there is a kind of aggressiveness at times that may not map to what we think the ideal regime would be. Now, the other half of the equation is it's been a little bit lax in the United States. And I think that may be changing.             </p><p>                But there's certainly been some sense of quite modest restrictions that have been hard-fought. When I think of, for example, the privacy restrictions placed on Internet service providers in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission saying you can't sort of snoop on what your own users are doing and try to sell that data anonymized or not, that was just reversed under the new American administration. So I think there is less of a regulatory hunger being demonstrated by the American executive branch.             </p><p>ARI SHAPIRO:                 Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard Law is the author of \"The Future Of The Internet And How To Stop It.\" He's also on the board of directors of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Thanks so much.             </p><p>JONATHAN ZITTRAIN:                 Thanks so much, Ari.             </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NPRATC-201801022004</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NPRATC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RB2-34D1-DY1J-T18W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429236</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 National Public Radio (R) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NPR All Things Considered</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 2, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Regulation &amp;

It certainly seems like it. A top EU meeting last month appears to have wrested power away from the Irish Data Protection Commissioner and into the hands of a new European quango which will be the continent's top decision maker on data protection issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Other countries have been arguing that Ireland lets tech giants such as Facebook and Google away with too much. So now, with 29 out of 30 top data companies located here, we can't be trusted to be in charge. Enter a newly-created European Data Protection Board which will supercede our commissioner on matters pertaining to big tech firms' data practices in Europe.</p><p>In so creating, the Germans believe that they have averted a \"disaster\" that would have happened had we been left running affairs.</p><p>\"We don't want to have the same disaster like we've seen in the financial system a few years ago,\" said Germany's interior minister, Thomas de Maizi\u00c8re, referring to us.</p><p>Why do the Germans - and many European politicians - think that we're a corporate light touch when it comes to protecting citizens' privacy online? Looking at ourselves honestly, do we kowtow to Silicon Valley's lords and princes at the expense of citizens' basic rights? Ireland's data protection minister, Dara Murphy, recently told a data privacy conference that it comes down to \"jealousy\". Ireland has cornered the market in big digital multinational bases, he argues, and withering comments from other European ministers only reflect resentment.</p><p>But European privacy activists I have spoken to in recent weeks paint a different picture. The man behind Europe's largest privacy legal action, Max Schrems, often talks of his experience of a cash-starved local operation that tries to swat serious queries away as a default response. \"You often don't get a proper response to a complaint and when you do, it's to tell you that there are no grounds for it to be considered,\" he told me.</p><p>Schrems is not alone in citing a published 2011 Irish data privacy audit on Facebook as evidence of an Irish 'light touch' on matters of privacy enforcement. A similar Irish data privacy audit last year of Linkedin, which has 84 million users in Europe and bases its headquarters in Dublin, also drew criticism for not being published. (The regulator said that to summarily publish the results of its privacy audits would be unfair on those being audited, which is a reasonable point.) Little things matter, too. A photo of the Irish Data Protection commissioner's office over a Centra convenience store in Portarlington is regularly reproduced by privacy campaigners as an ironic symbol of Ireland's dedication to data protection enforcement. Schrems, who has a relatively long history dealing with the Irish data protection commissioner, often pulls it up during seminars or talks on his Europe v Facebook case which has made it all the way to the European Court of Justice.</p><p>(When asked about this, the government was keen to point out that it is doubling the data protection office's headcount and opening a new Dublin office.) In a nutshell, European countries have learned to regard Ireland as a shell for US multinational tech interests. Rightly or wrongly, they believe we prioritise tens of thousands of high-tech jobs here above the finer points of European citizens' privacy online.</p><p>And this has now led to a major backtracking on what was supposed to be a new 'one-stop shop' system.</p><p>Under the previously set process, which was due to be introduced across the EU this year, companies such as Facebook with pan-EU users would only have had to deal with the data protection regulator in the country of its main base - Ireland. In this way, they would have had a 'one stop shop' for regulatory issues. This was very attractive to big firms like Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter, all of which are based in Ireland. For them, the prospect of having just one set of officials to deal with, as they might in the US, has obvious appeal. (They undoubtedly also like Ireland's interpretive instincts, which are closer to a US digital sensibility than German ones are.) For Ireland, it was also a very desirable outcome. This country markets itself in Silicon Valley as a core European district for digital infrastructure. Part of that pitch is around legal and regulatory certainty. And that includes being the decision maker on data issues.</p><p>But Germany and other countries aren't having it. So a new quango called the European Data Protection Board is to be set up that will supercede national data protection regulators. In other words, a German who is unsatisfied with a ruling from the Irish commissioner on Facebook or Google can now refer that to the new European body, which will be the defining voice.</p><p>Ireland isn't happy , arguing that it will add more bureaucracy to the process and make it harder for businesses. Dara Murphy also says that will lead to \"capricious referrals\". So he has asked for appeals to apply only when more than one country is concerned. Europe is considering this request.</p><p>For what it's worth, Britain, Denmark and Poland agree with us in our objections to the dilution of the one stop shop proposal.</p><p>But the German privacy sensibility is fast becoming the dominant influence when it comes to online regulation in Europe. And it is notching up victory after victory in reshaping both the regulatory environment for online tech companies and the enforceable rights of citizens.</p><p>From data retention (which Irish actors were pivotal in transforming) to CCTV footage to the 'right to be forgotten', there is a new wave of privacy assertion sweeping through European courts and federal bodies.</p><p>Many are cheering. But Ireland may have just lost a chunk of its power.</p><p>A photo of our commissioner's office over a Centra in Portarlington is regularly reproduced by campaigners</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ireland tried to position itself as a 'one-stop shop' data-wise</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-98084875</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FPS-JJP1-JBVM-Y52X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 9, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But the future of Facebook's relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland's capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators. Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices. Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that go into effect next month across the European Union. </p><p>They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information. Whether the U.S. Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated this past week, or whether big tech companies determine it's too cumbersome to treat the 500 million people of the E.U. differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation. \"As a first mover, that has now become a baseline,\" said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe \"is increasingly setting the norm.\" And Europeans have embraced the role. \"The E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,\" said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels. At the center of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland's data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion. \"Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,\" Dixon said in an interview in her Dublin townhouse office. \"It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.\" Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said \"malicious actors\" had used its search tools to match previously hacked email addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users' names, \"likes\" and other personal information \u2014 in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic. In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of who happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry. Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops. In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica mishap. And then there's Margrethe Vestager, the bloc's competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland. Vestager, who was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, has said she is increasingly turning her attention to issues around user data \u2014 a development that has cheered privacy advocates and chilled technology companies that complain they are being singled out for their success. \"It has become almost a habit of looking into data issues when we do a merger procedure, antitrust procedures,\" Vestager told reporters. \"Data is an asset,\" she said in a follow-up interview. \"You can mine it; you can work it; you can do completely different things.\" She said that regulators were treating data as a \"completely different creature\" than they did five years ago. U.S. state officials have taken cues from her antitrust enforcement strategy. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley mimicked her investigation into Google, for instance, and has demanded the company give him the same evidence. \"People like Josh Hawley don't want European consumers enjoying better protections than Missourians, so when you have this disparity in how the law is being enforced, it puts pressure on every other jurisdiction to say, \u2018What did we miss?' \" said Luther Lowe, the vice president for government relations at Yelp, the reviews website. Yelp has been Google's chief antagonist in the E.U. The United States was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers' most sensitive information. But Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and the intense, well-funded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley. Still, lawmakers are clearly intrigued by what Europe is doing. \"Would you support legislation to back that general principle: that opt-in, that getting permission, is the standard?\" Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., asked Zuckerberg during the first of two days of hearings. \"Europeans have passed that as a law. Facebook's going to live with that law beginning on May 25. Would you support that as the law in the United States?\" Zuckerberg sought to reassure users in the United States that they will get the same privacy controls as Europeans after the new laws come into effect, although he allowed himself some wiggle room on the specifics. \"I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection,\" Zuckerberg said. \"Regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries.\" For their part, European policymakers have relished their trendsetting status. \"The U.S. public right now is realizing that maybe the Europeans have done something that is in their own interest,\" said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of European Parliament who played a leading role in drafting the privacy regulation. Now technology companies are bracing for the privacy rules to kick in. In Ireland, the new powers will be a big change for a regulator who until recently was dinged for a lax approach to big technology companies. Some critics say Irish officials were holding their punches because of the country's tech-dependent economic growth. \"I'm not sure how much there's influence in it, how much there's politics in it and how much general consensus there is in Ireland in not regulating the big U.S. giants,\" said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate who scored repeated legal victories against Dixon's predecessor. People who have watched Dixon work say her style can be conciliatory rather than confrontational. Critics say her office has not always been aggressive about defending citizens' rights. \"You have a culture within the institution which relies on a limited use of statutory enforcement mechanisms and more on persuasion,\" said T.J. McIntyre, a law professor who is the chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, a group that has challenged how the Irish government retains information about its citizens. But observers say Dixon's beefed-up resources and enforcement powers are likely to give her new ammunition as she pushes companies to fall in line. Just four years ago, Ireland's data protection office was a backwater, with 25 employees housed above a convenience store outside Dublin. When Dixon took the reins in late 2014, she fought for more funding, quadrupled her staff and moved into the capital. The Georgian townhouse is a brisk walk away from the glassy new tech district that has sprung up around a once-scruffy dock area. Dixon plans to hire another 40 staffers this year. \"I don't think the data protection authority was sufficiently staffed at the point where I came on board,\" Dixon said. \"I think it has been rectified.\" Still, enforcement may require a fight: Both Google and Apple have appealed Vestager's judgments against them. The new E.U. rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will give individuals far more control over their personal data. Companies will have to spell out what they will use data for and give users clear choices about whether to agree. Individuals would be able to force companies to return data to them if they wanted to leave a service. Vestager, the competition chief, said the aim is to ensure web users \"feel they are somewhat in control\" of their data. She mentioned Facebook's recent troubles with Cambridge Analytica. \"I think the situation is quite good, because very often when something happens that sort of turns people's attention to an issue, you say, \u2018Oh. It's brand new. We have to regulate,'\" she said. In this case, she said, Europe already has a legal framework that \"actually, for real, allows the individual to enforce their rights.\" --- Romm reported from Washington.

But the future of Facebook\u2019s relationship with its 2 billion users is less likely to be determined from the halls of Congress than it is from an unassuming 18th-century townhouse in Ireland\u2019s capital packed with lawyers, technology experts and gumshoe investigators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Europe has been moving aggressively to impose order on the tech space. Already, it has inflicted painful penalties on Apple and Google for their business practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, technology companies are readying themselves for sweeping new privacy rules that go into effect next month across the European Union. They could face billion-dollar fines if they fail to give European users far more control over their personal information.</p><p>Whether the U.S. Congress follows the European model, as some lawmakers floated this past week, or whether big tech companies determine it\u2019s too cumbersome to treat the 500 million people of the E.U. differently from the rest of the world, Europe is likely to keep setting the global pace for aggressive regulation.</p><p>\u201cAs a first mover, that has now become a baseline,\u201d said Dean Garfield, the president of the Information Technology Industry Council, a Washington-based trade group for tech giants such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. Europe \u201cis increasingly setting the norm.\u201d</p><p>And Europeans have embraced the role.</p><p>\u201cThe E.U. is a real regulatory superpower, and it exports its values and its standards,\u201d said Christopher Kuner, a director of the Brussels Privacy Hub at the Free University of Brussels.</p><p>At the center of the action is Helen Dixon, Ireland\u2019s data protection commissioner. Because the European operations for many big technology companies are headquartered in low-tax Ireland, Dixon is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants including Facebook, Google, Apple, LinkedIn and Airbnb when the new privacy regime comes into force on May 25. She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue \u2014 which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6 billion.</p><p>\u201cTheir business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,\u201d Dixon said in an interview in her Dublin townhouse office. \u201cIt creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.\u201d</p><p>Facebook\u2019s latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe\u2019s long-planned privacy rules. On April 4, the company said \u201cmalicious actors\u201d had used its search tools to match previously hacked email addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company\u2019s report that Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Donald Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87 million Facebook users\u2019 names, \u201clikes\u201d and other personal information \u2014 in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of who happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry.</p><p>Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops.</p><p>In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica mishap.</p><p>And then there\u2019s Margrethe Vestager, the bloc\u2019s competition chief. She thwacked Google with a nearly $3 billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16 billion in back taxes to Ireland.</p><p>Vestager, who was in Washington, D.C., on Friday, has said she is increasingly turning her attention to issues around user data \u2014 a development that has cheered privacy advocates and chilled technology companies that complain they are being singled out for their success.</p><p>\u201cIt has become almost a habit of looking into data issues when we do a merger procedure, antitrust procedures,\u201d Vestager told reporters.</p><p>\u201cData is an asset,\u201d she said in a follow-up interview. \u201cYou can mine it; you can work it; you can do completely different things.\u201d She said that regulators were treating data as a \u201ccompletely different creature\u201d than they did five years ago.</p><p>U.S. state officials have taken cues from her antitrust enforcement strategy. Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley mimicked her investigation into Google, for instance, and has demanded the company give him the same evidence.</p><p>\u201cPeople like Josh Hawley don\u2019t want European consumers enjoying better protections than Missourians, so when you have this disparity in how the law is being enforced, it puts pressure on every other jurisdiction to say, \u2018What did we miss?\u2019 \u201d said Luther Lowe, the vice president for government relations at Yelp, the reviews website. Yelp has been Google\u2019s chief antagonist in the E.U.</p><p>The United States was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government\u2019s ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers\u2019 most sensitive information. But Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and the intense, well-funded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley.</p><p>Still, lawmakers are clearly intrigued by what Europe is doing.</p><p>\u201cWould you support legislation to back that general principle: that opt-in, that getting permission, is the standard?\u201d Sen. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., asked Zuckerberg during the first of two days of hearings. \u201cEuropeans have passed that as a law. Facebook\u2019s going to live with that law beginning on May 25. Would you support that as the law in the United States?\u201d</p><p>Zuckerberg sought to reassure users in the United States that they will get the same privacy controls as Europeans after the new laws come into effect, although he allowed himself some wiggle room on the specifics.</p><p>\u201cI think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cRegardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries.\u201d</p><p>For their part, European policymakers have relished their trendsetting status.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. public right now is realizing that maybe the Europeans have done something that is in their own interest,\u201d said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of European Parliament who played a leading role in drafting the privacy regulation.</p><p>Now technology companies are bracing for the privacy rules to kick in.</p><p>In Ireland, the new powers will be a big change for a regulator who until recently was dinged for a lax approach to big technology companies.</p><p>Some critics say Irish officials were holding their punches because of the country\u2019s tech-dependent economic growth.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure how much there\u2019s influence in it, how much there\u2019s politics in it and how much general consensus there is in Ireland in not regulating the big U.S. giants,\u201d said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate who scored repeated legal victories against Dixon\u2019s predecessor.</p><p>People who have watched Dixon work say her style can be conciliatory rather than confrontational. Critics say her office has not always been aggressive about defending citizens\u2019 rights.</p><p>\u201cYou have a culture within the institution which relies on a limited use of statutory enforcement mechanisms and more on persuasion,\u201d said T.J. McIntyre, a law professor who is the chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, a group that has challenged how the Irish government retains information about its citizens.</p><p>But observers say Dixon\u2019s beefed-up resources and enforcement powers are likely to give her new ammunition as she pushes companies to fall in line.</p><p>Just four years ago, Ireland\u2019s data protection office was a backwater, with 25 employees housed above a convenience store outside Dublin.</p><p>When Dixon took the reins in late 2014, she fought for more funding, quadrupled her staff and moved into the capital. The Georgian townhouse is a brisk walk away from the glassy new tech district that has sprung up around a once-scruffy dock area. Dixon plans to hire another 40 staffers this year.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the data protection authority was sufficiently staffed at the point where I came on board,\u201d Dixon said. \u201cI think it has been rectified.\u201d</p><p>Still, enforcement may require a fight: Both Google and Apple have appealed Vestager\u2019s judgments against them.</p><p>The new E.U. rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will give individuals far more control over their personal data. Companies will have to spell out what they will use data for and give users clear choices about whether to agree. Individuals would be able to force companies to return data to them if they wanted to leave a service.</p><p>Vestager, the competition chief, said the aim is to ensure web users \u201cfeel they are somewhat in control\u201d of their data.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Helen Dixon, data protection commissioner for Ireland, is set to become the top cop for U.S. tech giants.

She will have the power to slap companies with fines of up to 4\u00a0percent of global revenue - which for Facebook could mean penalties of up to $1.6\u00a0billion.</p><p>\"Their business model is around monetizing personal data, and this creates very significant challenges in terms of fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals,\" Dixon said in an interview in her Dublin townhouse office. \"It creates a type of surveillance and tracking of individuals across the Internet that undoubtedly needs regulation.\"</p><p>Facebook's latest scandal has been perfectly timed to draw attention to Europe's long-planned privacy rules. On April\u00a04, the company said \"malicious actors\" had used its search tools to match previously hacked email addresses and phone numbers to Facebook profiles. That follows the company's report that\u00a0Cambridge Analytica, a data analysis firm hired by President Trump during his 2016 campaign, improperly accessed 87\u00a0million Facebook \u00adusers' names, \"likes\" and other personal information - in many cases without their knowledge or consent. The matter has spawned investigations on both sides of the Atlantic.</p><p>In Europe, Dixon joins an elite rank of enforcers, many of whom happen to be women, holding power over the U.S. tech industry.\u00a0</p><p>Her partners include Andrea Jelinek, an Austrian data protection regulator who is expected to lead a new board of E.U. consumer-privacy cops.</p><p>In the E.U. capital of Brussels, top justice official Vera Jourova has challenged Facebook in recent weeks over the Cambridge Analytica affair.</p><p>And then there's\u00a0Margrethe \u00adVestager, the bloc's competition chief.\u00a0She thwacked\u00a0Google with a nearly $3\u00a0billion fine and is forcing it to overhaul how it presents sponsored shopping results. She is making Apple pay $16\u00a0billion in back taxes to Ireland.\u00a0</p><p>Vestager, who was in Washington on Friday, has said she is increasingly turning her attention to issues around user data - a development that has cheered privacy advocates and chilled technology companies, which complain they are being targeted for their success.</p><p>\"It has become almost a habit of looking into data issues when we do a merger procedure, antitrust procedures,\" Vestager told reporters.\u00a0</p><p>\"Data is an asset,\" she said in a follow-up interview. \"You can mine it; you can work it; you can do completely different things.\" She said that regulators were treating data as a \"completely different creature\" than they did five years ago.</p><p>U.S. state officials have taken cues from her antitrust enforcement strategy. Josh Hawley, Missouri's attorney general, mimicked her investigation into Google, for instance, and has demanded the company give him the same evidence.</p><p>\"People like Josh Hawley don't want European consumers enjoying better protections than Missourians, so when you have this disparity in how the law is being enforced, it puts pressure on every other jurisdiction to say, 'What did we miss?' \" said Luther Lowe, the vice president for government relations at Yelp, the reviews website.\u00a0Yelp has been Google's chief antagonist in the European Union.</p><p>The United States was caught somewhat flat-footed by the Facebook privacy scandal. Lawmakers have debated whether to enhance the government's ability to investigate and penalize tech giants that misuse consumers' most sensitive information. But Congress has so far failed to pass a single comprehensive privacy law for the digital age, stumbling in no small part because of partisan warfare and intense, well-funded lobbying efforts from Silicon Valley.</p><p>Still, lawmakers are clearly intrigued by what Europe is doing.</p><p>\"Would you support legislation to back that general principle: that opt-in, that getting permission, is the standard?\" Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) asked Zuckerberg during the first of two days of hearings. \"Europeans have passed that as a law. Facebook's going to live with that law beginning on May\u00a025. Would you support that as the law in the United States?\"</p><p>Zuckerberg sought to reassure users in the United States that they will get the same privacy controls as Europeans after the new laws come into effect, although he allowed himself some wiggle room on the specifics.</p><p>\"I think everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection,\" Zuckerberg said.\u00a0\"Regardless of whether we implement the exact same regulation, I would guess that it would be somewhat different, because we have somewhat different sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries.\"</p><p>For their part, European policy\u00admakers have relished their trendsetting status.</p><p>\"The U.S. public right now is realizing that maybe the Europeans have done something that is in their own interest,\" said Jan Philipp Albrecht, a German member of the European Parliament who played a leading role in drafting the privacy regulations.</p><p>Now technology companies are bracing for the privacy rules to kick in.</p><p>In Ireland, the new powers will be a big change for a regulator who until recently was dinged for a lax approach to big technology companies. </p><p>Some critics say Irish officials were holding their punches \u00adbecause of the country's tech-dependent economic growth.</p><p>\"I'm not sure how much there's influence in it, how much there's politics in it, and how much general consensus there is in Ireland in not regulating the big U.S. giants,\" said Max Schrems, an Austrian privacy advocate who scored repeated legal victories against Dixon's predecessor.</p><p>People who have watched Dixon work say her style can be conciliatory rather than confrontational. Critics say her office has not always been aggressive about defending citizens' rights.</p><p>\"You have a culture within the institution which relies on a limited use of statutory enforcement mechanisms and more on persuasion,\" said T.J. McIntyre, a law professor who is the chairman of Digital Rights Ireland, a group that has challenged how the Irish government retains information about its citizens.</p><p>But observers say Dixon's beefed-up resources and enforcement powers are likely to give her new ammunition as she pushes companies to fall in line.</p><p>Just four years ago, Ireland's data protection office was a backwater, with 25 employees housed above a convenience store outside Dublin.</p><p>When Dixon took the reins in late 2014, she fought for more funding, quadrupled her staff and moved into the capital. The Georgian townhouse is a brisk walk away from the glassy new tech district that has sprung up around a once-scruffy dock area. Dixon plans to hire another 40 staffers this year.</p><p>\"I don't think the data protection authority was sufficiently staffed at the point where I came on board,\" Dixon said. \"I think it has been rectified.\"</p><p>Still, enforcement may require a fight: Both Google and Apple have appealed Vestager's judgments against them.</p><p>The new E.U. rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, will give individuals far more control over their personal data. Companies will have to spell out what they will use data for and give users clear choices about whether to agree. Individuals would be able to force companies to return data to them if they wanted to leave a service.</p><p>Vestager, the competition chief, said the aim is to ensure that Web users \"feel they are somewhat in control\" of their data.</p><p>She mentioned Facebook's recent troubles with Cambridge \u00adAnalytica.</p><p>\"I think the situation is quite good, because very often when something happens that sort of turns people's attention to an issue, you say, 'Oh. It's brand new. We have to regulate,' \" she said. In this case, she said, Europe already has a legal framework that \"actually, for real, allows the individual to enforce their rights.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:michael.birnbaum@washpost.com\">michael.birnbaum@washpost.com</email></p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p><p>Romm reported from Washington.

In this article, I'll be covering three reasons why companies that have nothing to do with finance will get into financial services and what that transition may look like.</p><h>1.\u00a0 A new revenue stream</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why companies that have nothing to do with finance will get into financial services.</p><p>Incumbent banks are strongly disliked by their customers. According to GlobalWebIndex, 45% of US and UK millennials want to change bank in the next 12 months and 62% of Americans, according to a consumer survey Bain report, would rather bank with a big tech company.</p><p>And then fintech alternatives step in: they make banking sexy, intuitive and attractive. They call themselves \"challenger banks\" and \"neobanks\". But the truth is that you can offer banking services without becoming a bank. Some sources in the industry argue that most fintechs don't plan on ever becoming a bank, even though they may use the word \"bank\" in their description.</p><p>As incumbent banks focus on transforming their legacy infrastructure, nimble start-ups and data-rich companies such as Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google (FANGs) are innovating. They roll out products quickly and design products centred around the customer journey and experience. Fintechs have gone all-in by offering great banking solutions, and FANGs are entering the space too, with the Apple Credit Card, Shopify Payments and Uber Money to name a few. Soon, every other company will realise that they too can offer banking solutions to their customers.</p><p>Banking solutions open up another channel for a company to make money through loans and credit. Financial services also allow companies to gather data about customer preferences and therefore offer more personalised user experiences to consumers. Personalised marketing and customer experiences attract more buyers to a product, which translates into additional revenue generated.</p><p>Fintech veteran, Chris Skinner, predicts that every company will offer profitable banking solutions, leaving the large incumbents with expensive products such as deposits. This means that banks will have to start charging for customers to use their accounts, creating another section of unbanked customers. These newly unbanked customers will then head to those companies that offer better user experiences and tailored customer offers. This positive feedback loop means there is a lot of space for growth in the banking solutions sector.</p><h>2.\u00a0 It's easy to offer finances \"as-a-service\"</h><p>But how can a company offer banking solutions? What about all the regulations in place?</p><p>Building a bank is no easy feat. To build a bank, a company would need a licence; this takes several years to acquire and may require \"borrowing\" from another bank. Then they would need a large database to manage your customers' money, as well as appropriate integration with payment providers such as Visa and Mastercard. Banks also need to meet the correct regulations in order to provide credit, authenticate users and combat fraud. This takes a lot of time, money and resources.</p><p>That's where fintechs come in: thanks to the tech ecosystem, many different fintechs partnering together can provide \"banking solution as a service\". Instead of a company creating their own banking solution, they can integrate with five other fintechs that will already meet all regulations and have extensive experience working in the sector. One fintech provides the know your client (KYC) checks (e.g. Onfido), another provides the credit checking (e.g. Credit Karma) and another one offers the open banking licence (e.g. TrueLayer). All the company needs to do is \"plug-in\".</p><p>This means it won't be so difficult to offer financial services and companies can easily add banking products to their offering. As more and more companies add banking solutions to their products, fintech will be everywhere.</p><p>Companies such as Plaid in the US and Truelayer in the UK are already doing this. By using a company like Truelayer, a company doesn't need to understand how the Second Payments Directive (PSD2) works or how to meet the regulations - they take care of all that. Not only does Truelayer do all the legwork, but they also provide the data in a readable format, making it easy for companies to build a holistic view of their customers' profiles.</p><p>These new connections make the entire process streamlined. With fintechs getting very good at one specific thing and then integrating with other fintechs, companies can easily offer financial services in a way that gathers relevant data, fights fraud and keeps customers at the centre.</p><h>3.\u00a0 Payments are becoming invisible</h><p>Payments are slowly disappearing from the equation. Cash moves to contactless, contactless moves on to mobile payments and soon, payments will be more of an afterthought. A consumer sees a product they want on social media, on the street or in a shop, and all they have to do is open their phone and click \"Buy Now\".</p><p>The whole definition of payments is changing. Instead of payment networks, people will be paying with their identity: the company they're buying from knows it's them through their financial services branch, so all they have to do is validate the payment.</p><p>Banking solutions offer companies an opportunity to completely personalise the shopping process. If their customer has problems buying a large ticket item, the company can bundle the product into a loan to help purchase the item. By offering financial services, companies can remove the friction that comes with payments and focus more on customer engagement and brand identity. The companies that won't adopt this will simply sell fewer products, as consumers will move towards brands that offer frictionless, integrated and personalised user experience.</p><p>As payments remove themselves from the equation and providing banking services becomes easier, companies will start offering their own financial services to customers. Not only does this open a new revenue stream, but it means companies can build a thorough picture of their customers and therefore offer much more personalised products and services.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fintechfutures.com/files/2020/03/digital-tech.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FNTECH-15210527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FNTECH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C9-G6K1-JBSJ-V37G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472844</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Informal PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fintechfutures.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19127\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 30, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The other four? Nothing. </p><p>But maybe not for long. The issue of data privacy has suddenly become a rallying cry to #deleteFacebook and to break up Big Tech under antitrust rules. This could be exactly the kind of issue that leads not only to a sell-off in richly valued stocks, but also a sell-off in a richly valued stock market. At writing, Facebook's shares are down 22% from a 52-week intraday high of 195.32 on February 1. Most of that decline has come since Facebook closed at $185.09 on March 16, the day The New York Times broke the Cambridge Analytica story. Nothing gets the attention of shareholders and the press like losing more than $100 billion in market capitalization. If the issue of data privacy (and what that even means) was only confined to Facebook, it would be an interesting, but unimportant story in the scheme of things. But it's not just confined to Facebook. A growing backlash against Silicon Valley is brewing. That backlash - or #techlash, as it's been referred to on Twitter - threatens to tip the stock market from a correction to a crash. FTC Comes Knocking, Public LeavesCould the government conceivably break up Big Tech under antitrust laws?The established threshold for breaking up a big company is that the company must be engaging in behavior that is harmful to consumers. The classic example is Standard Oil's monopoly on the oil industry. Its control of the refining industry and the retail industry (gas stations) gave it unique (and potentially harmful) pricing power in the consumer market. Busted! Until mid-March, it was hard to make the case that any tech companies should be broken up on antitrust grounds. Google? Gmail is free and Google's search engine is the most popular in the world because it helps people find what they're looking for. Apple? Show me a Mac user who won't shut up about how great they are. And Amazon? What's so bad about low prices and 24-hour delivery? Facebook, though, has changed the antitrust case against tech. Instead of talking about the services these companies provide us (many of which appear to be free, not including your time and data), the conversation is now about the vast troves of data these companies are accumulating from us. It's just now dawning on people that Facebook is a giant data mining operation. You provide the content. You give the company permission to access your phone calls, your text messages, and reams of other data generated by the apps you've installed on your phone. Facebook sells it. Is that unethical? Is that illegal? Can voters or consumers be manipulated into making decisions that The New York Times does not approve of (voting for Donald Trump, for example) all because of Facebook's data policies? The public seems to think so. A poll commissioned by media company Axios shows that Facebook's favorability fell by 28% from October 2017 to March of this year. It was the largest decline of any of the techs. Barely a third of the American public has a 'favorable' view of Facebook. Apple, Amazon, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft also fell, but retained largely favorable ratings. Facebook has attempted to soothe the public's ruffled feathers by reminding people that sharing your call history and text messages is something you agree to when you use Facebook's services. If you don't want to share that data - or have it sold - you can opt out all of which sounds reasonable enough. Consumers do have a choice in what technologies to use and what permissions to grant the services they patronize. What has changed is our perception of Big Tech. We used to see it as a liberating instrument of communication, information, and individual expression. Now, we see institutions that have lobbied successfully for a light regulatory and tax treatment in order to build vast databases of information which are either sold to people who want to manipulate us or used directly to manipulate us. Is this behavior that is harmful to consumers? Last week, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. Attorneys general from 37 different states have demanded that Facebook explain its privacy practices, according to The Wall Street Journal. This could be the precursor to fines, regulations, or class-action lawsuits all of which could be damaging to Facebook's reputation and share price. Even if Facebook violated its own policies on sharing data, it's not clear whether it has broken a federal law or engaged in anti-competitive practices. But this could be a sign of things to come. Tech's Threat to the BullThat's where the real damage may happen. Breaking up the Big Tech companies or regulating them as if they were public utilities would be disastrous for their bottom lines. And Big Tech stocks have been some of the best performers of this bull market. The Wall Street Journal reported that, as of March 12, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet (Google) had accounted for 45% of year-to-date gains for the S...00. A momentum market is happy to reward tech companies with rich multiples on earning and sales, especially when their audience is growing and the press is good. But as thousands, and then millions, abandon the popular tech platforms, the story will change. Buyers will become sellers. You'd expect to see a change in the leadership of the stock market at the very least. But it's more likely that the tech stocks will lead the sell-off in the market. The February lows will be retested. We'll go from correction to crash. Why? Passive investing through index-tracking and exchange-traded funds have led to a lot of lazy buying of momentum stocks. Big Tech stocks have gotten bigger on a market-cap basis and have taken the indices with them. As Silicon Valley faces its day of reckoning, the market will pay the price, too. Swamp Gets SwampierIt doesn't help that the #techlash is happening at the same time that the U.S. government is auctioning off $294 billion in debt. That's the highest amount of bonds and notes for sale since the financial crisis in 2008. And it comes as the Fed is talking about raising interest rates and ending its bond purchase program (quantitative tightening). What's more, the feds tacked on a trillion dollars in new debt in the last six months alone. The U.S. government debt-to-GDP ratio is now 105% (the all-time high was 119%, after five years of World War on two fronts). After years of record-low interest rates and a nine-year stock market boom, the nation's debts are spiraling of control. Spending is, too. In the 2,300-page omnibus funding bill that a Republican Congress passed and a Republican president signed, there was an increase in defense spending (now over $700 billion per year) and an extra $200 million for the IRS to simplify the tax code! Can you smell the methane? The swamp just got swampier. My point is that Facebook's public relations data debacle may be the prefect catalyst for the stock market crash we've seen coming. Tech will lead. Everything else will follow. And the stock market crash will usher in the recession, along with the help of rising rates from the Fed.

Continue reading Why Facebook is making a big bet on Messenger</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the first day of Facebook's developer conference this week, the company sketched out a vision of its message-centric future. One of the most striking things about this move, from a product perspective, is how it demotes the News Feed. While Mark Zuckerberg says that what he calls  the digital town square  will continue to be important, the product itself will attempt to draw you into virtual living rooms: private groups, events, and messages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I noted here yesterday, part of what is driving this change is the fact that users are already voting with their clicks and taps   spending less time in the News Feed than they are in more private spaces. Sharing photos and videos with friends still appears to be quite popular in Instagram and WhatsApp, which continue to build out new products to support the activity.</p><p>But say you're one of the hundreds of millions of people who spends most of their time on Facebook proper. Where is the place where you're supposed to see what your friends are doing and send them messages? That was the core feedback loop that got Facebook this year. In a world where people stop posting to the News Feed, where will they go?</p><p>We actually got a pretty good answer to that question during F8 this week, though it could be hard to discern against the din of other product announcements. But Facebook does have a plan for your real friends on Facebook   and the plan is unfolding in Messenger.</p><p>Ben Thompson had a characteristically sharp take on the news in his (subscriber-only) daily update today. He argues that Facebook was forced to take this strategy because Snapchat and Instagram eroded the popularity of the News Feed, and that last year's move to promote  meaningful posts  at the expense of big publishers only made it worse.</p><p>That, then, led to this new strategy: let Facebook be Facebook   that is, most people's portal to the Internet   with a focus on Groups to deepen Facebook's network moat. Give up on trying to refashion a service known for a lack of privacy into a destination for friends and family. Meanwhile, rebuild Messenger into a social network in its own right, complete with its own feed (that second tab) and network (albeit a subset of your Facebook network). And oh-by-the-way, frame it as an embrace of privacy while changing nothing about the core Facebook experience and ad machine.</p><p>Messenger took up an outsized portion of yesterday's keynote. (Or maybe not   it does have 1.3 billion users.) After a redesign last year succeeded in simplifying it from the overstuffed junk drawer it had become, Facebook said it would make Messenger the fastest-loading product of its kind, with an app size of less than 30 megabytes. The company announced plans to bring it to the desktop to promote heavier usage. And it also announced that second tab Thompson mentions   a place to see your friends' ephemeral stories, their current statuses (represented by emoji), and perhaps eventually even stories they've added to the News Feed. (Facebook is already testing a merger of the two.)</p><p>Asha Sharma, who leads Messenger's consumer products, had a starring role in yesterday's keynote. On Wednesday, I sat down with her to talk more about Messenger's future. One thing that struck me immediately is how she talks about Messenger as separate from Facebook in an important way   the latter is about communities now, she said, and Messenger is a social network in its own right.</p><p> The opportunity that Messenger has is, we are building a social network around messaging   not the other way around,  she said.  In messaging, you communicate mostly with five friends. If you can build experiences on top those conversations that help you share more and spend real quality time together, that's awesome. </p><p>Today, Messenger has a central  people  tab that Sharma describes as a  social phone book.  It offers a row of Facebook stories, then a list of your active contacts. When the new Messenger arrives, that tab will be replaced by content shared by close friends. Sharma showed me a beta version of the app, where family members and colleagues she worked closely with had bubbled up to the top.  It's a space where I can share into small groups and the people I care most about,  she said.</p><p>Of course, just because Facebook builds a spot for friends in Messenger doesn't mean they'll come. Analytics firms say that despite Messenger's lead in audience size, Snapchat users open the app much more frequently and spend longer amounts of time there. Messenger's new strategy relies heavily on the adoption of Facebook stories   and while the product has reached 500 million people a month globally, it continues to feel moribund among North American Facebook users in their 20s and 30s.</p><p>But as long as that particular cohort is still glued to Instagram, Facebook won't suffer for it. And in the meantime, Messenger can serve as a laboratory for features that attempt to replicate the simple pleasures of the News Feed that have long since evaporated. Sharma tells me her team hasn't cracked it yet   they're still debating how that friends tab should look and feel. But if you're curious which aspects of the old Facebook might survive in the new one, that's where I'd look.</p><p>More from F8</p><p>F8 wrapped up today in San Jose. What happened? The day two keynote focused on building products more responsibly, and featured good talks from Margaret Stewart on ethical design and Lade Obamehinti on building artificial intelligence that is more inclusive. (Obamehinti shared a powerful story about how Portal's  smart camera  didn't recognize her at first, having been trained on a data set that used mostly white skin tones.)</p><p>Harry McCracken talked to Facebook's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, ahead of the keynote:</p><p>By sharing this data, Schroepfer hopes to belie impressions that Facebook isn't taking the challenge of cleaning up its platform seriously enough. He is, however, quick to acknowledge that more work remains to be done and doesn't criticize the skeptics.  The hardest thing for me personally is a sense that we don't care,  he says.  It's either we don't care, or we're not prioritizing it, or  It just doesn't match my own personal experience day to day.' But people get to feel what they feel, and until we get it right, they're justified feeling whatever they want. </p><p>Other stuff: You can now ask sensitive questions in health groups on Facebook anonymously. Amazon Prime Video is coming to Portal. Oculus is becoming a business play, and it's courting developers. Facebook is open-sourcing more tools. Facebook threw a party for employees to celebrate the big redesign.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>Google employees protest retaliation with international sit-in</p><p>Sitting in is the new walking out:</p><p>Google employees are holding a sit-in at offices around the world to protest alleged retaliation against workers.</p><p>A Google employee told The Verge that hundreds were expected to be involved throughout the day, with sit-ins at offices scheduled for 11AM local time. A Google spokesperson said more than 200 employees participated in the New York sit-in, but that not all company offices participated. Employees in international offices, including London, also took part.</p><p>Twitter grilled on policy approach that reinforces misogyny</p><p>Twitter sent a representative to pay lip service to U.K. Parliament on Wednesday over harassment issues, Natasha Lomas reports:</p><p>Twitter has faced a barrage of awkward questions from the U.K. parliament over its ongoing failure to tackle violent abuse targeted at women.</p><p>Katy Minshall, the social media platform's head of U.K. government public policy, admitted it needs to do more to safeguard women users   but claimed the company is  acutely aware  of the problems women experience on Twitter, saying it's in the process of reviewing how it applies its policies to fix its long-running misogyny problem.</p><p>Here come the European Parliament tech hawks</p><p>Laurens Cerulus and Laura Kayali profile the members of Parliament who intend to take on Silicon Valley:</p><p>At the top of the list  to watch  during the next five years is Facebook's antagonist in Germany: Justice Minister Katarina Barley.</p><p>Barley leads the list of her country's Social Democratic Party and has bashedFacebook repeatedly on the campaign trail, calling on the company to do more to protect its users' data and saying,  I am not on WhatsApp, nor do I want to be. </p><p>Amazon's facial-recognition AI is supercharging police in Oregon. But what if Rekognition gets it wrong?</p><p>Drew Harwell looks at how Amazon's facial recognition technology has affected law enforcement in the Oregon county where it was first deployed:</p><p>Almost overnight, deputies saw their investigative powers supercharged, allowing them to scan for matches of a suspect's face across more than 300,000 mug shots taken at the county jail since 2001. A grainy picture of someone's face   captured by a security camera, a social-media account or a deputy's smartphone   can quickly become a link to their identity, including their name, family and address. More than 1,000 facial-recognition searches were logged last year, said deputies, who sometimes used the results to find a suspect's Facebook page, visit their home or make an arrest.</p><p>But Washington County also became ground zero for a high-stakes battle over the unregulated growth of policing by algorithm. Defense attorneys, artificial-intelligence researchers and civil rights experts argue that the technology could lead to the wrongful arrest of innocent people who bear only a resemblance to a video image. Rekognition's accuracy is also hotly disputed, and some experts worry that a case of mistaken identity by armed deputies could have dangerous implications, threatening privacy and people's lives.</p><p>Silicon Valley is awash in Chinese and Saudi cash   and no one is paying attention (except Donald Trump)</p><p>Teddy Schleifer examines Silicon Valley's increasingly tense relationship with foreign capital:</p><p>For too long, most people in Silicon Valley have treated foreign cash with a collective shrug, seeing money as money and not truly considering the ethical and regulatory challenges of taking investment from certain foreign countries, Recode interviews with more than 50 venture capitalists, startups, lawyers, and others involved in cross-border investing reveal. Now Silicon Valley is scrambling to assess its own exposure in this new world order.</p><p>Money from two countries in particular has ignited a debate in Silicon Valley about the responsibilities of startups and their investors: China and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>The productivity pit: how Slack is ruining work</p><p>Rani Molla explores how Slack fell short of its promise to make workers more productive:</p><p>On average, employees at large companies are each sending more than 200 Slack messages per week, according to Time Is Ltd., a productivity-analytics company that taps into workplace programs   including Slack, calendar apps, and the Office Suite   in order to give companies recommendations on how to be more productive. Power users sending out more than 1,000 messages per day are  not an exception. </p><p>Keeping up with these conversations can seem like a full-time job. After a while, the software goes from helping you work to making it impossible to get work done.</p><p> They're Just Wrong  Ex-Reddit CEO Ellen Pao Has Harsh Words on Big Tech's Failure to Stop Internet Hate</p><p>Ellen Pao talks to Mother Jones about the power of de-platforming:</p><p>PAO: I don't want to be negative about the way things are being run, but this is a different philosophy. For me, it's about,  Let's get a clean platform where everybody can have a conversation and actually have a real conversation and not just have as many people shout at each other as possible.  It's been a long time since you could really go to Reddit and see that conversations were authentic.</p><p>If that's what Twitter and Reddit are trying to have, then you've gotta get rid of people who are shouting people out of the public square, who are really bullying people. That's not a conversation. You have to make sure everyone has the space to speak and make sure that the speech isn't causing damage and that's not happening right now.</p><p>Snap's big plan to turn Snapchat into a gaming platform</p><p>Andrew Webster explores Snap's big push into video games:</p><p>For Snap, there are clear benefits to having a hit game on the platform. It means users will spend more time in Snapchat and see more ads along the way. (Currently, there's only one form of monetization on Snap Games: six-second-long commercials that players can view in exchange for in-game currency.) But don't expect to see the next App Store-style gold rush for third-party developers. Snap Games isn't an open-platform; instead, the company is partnering with a small number of developers to offer a more curated selection of games. At present, that includes everything from big companies like Zynga to smaller studios like Alphabear developer Spry Fox. From the sound of it, Snap is serving almost like a publisher, working with studios throughout the entire development process, from conception to launch.</p><p>Move Over, Kardashians. Pilots Are the Stars of Instagram</p><p>Everyone loves airline pilots on Instagram, Blake Montgomery reports:</p><p>Biedenkapp is part of a larger trend: airline pilots as Instagram sensations. Madeleine Schneider-Weiffenbach, who posts as @pilotmadeleine, boasts 1.1 million followers. The #pilot hashtag has 5.2 million tagged posts. Anas Amireh, who flies Airbus A350 planes out of London, has 390,000 as @pilotamireh followers and several dedicated fan pages. There's enough pilot enthusiasm to sustain two huge accounts run by pilots named Maria   @mariathepilot, 462,000 followers, and @pilotmaria, 535,000.</p><p>Launches</p><p>Introducing auto-delete controls for your Location History and activity data</p><p>Google will soon let you delete your location history automatically, making it immeasurably easier for you to commit crimes.</p><p>Takes</p><p>Facebook pivots to what it wishes it was</p><p>Josh Constine shares his thoughts on F8:</p><p>Wired reported that Zuckerberg authored a strategy book given to all employees ahead of the IPO that noted  If we don't create the thing that kills Facebook, someone else will.  But F8 offered a new interpretation. Maybe given the lack of direct competitors in its league, and the absence of a mass exodus over its constant privacy scandals, it was the outdated product itself that was killing Facebook. The permanent Facebook. The all-you-do-is-scroll Facebook. The bored-of-my-friends Facebook. Users were being neglected rather than pushed or stolen. By ignoring the past and emphasizing the products it aspires to have dominate tomorrow   Groups, Marketplace, Watch   Facebook can start to unchain itself from the toxic brand poisoning its potential.</p><p>Joe Biden's Bad Announcement Tweet Was a Good Boomer Post</p><p>Max Read praises the humble authenticity of Joe Biden's social-media brand:</p><p>Or did the team decide that Biden's social-media brand is going to be  balloon background ? In 2016, Hillary Clinton's Twitter presence was widely mocked (by natives, at any rate) for its attempts at mimicking the power-user form that AOC has managed to deploy so effectively on her own account. The core complaint was about authenticity: Who could believe that Clinton was tweeting Mean Girls GIFs to dunk on Donald Trump when, as a baby-boomer, she'd be much more likely to be posting the single word  banana,  presumably accidentally, on top of a gradient background? Biden may look very silly to Twitter sophisticates with his attempted solemnity interspersed with odd ellipses and double hyphens. But no one can say it's not how a 76-year-old would post.</p><p>And finally  </p><p>How an Aquafresh Parody Tumblr Got Swept Up in a Hate-Speech Purge</p><p>In the tweeted words of the story's author, Brian Feldman:  An Aquafresh brand-parody Tumblr that was posting Avengers spoilers was reportedly permabanned for hate speech, but it was actually because the account was tied to a Toy Story-themed community-led Nazi purge. </p><p> They banned it for a reasonable choice,  Josh admitted. He didn't sound at all distraught about Tumblr snapping Aquafresh out of existence just like Thanos snapped the Avengers away.  Everything's good,  he said.  It's just time for me to move on from Tumblr, and go on Twitter instead.  It makes sense: You're far less likely to get swept up in a hate-speech purge on Twitter.</p><p>Just another day on the internet, folks.</p><p>Talk to me</p><p>Send me tips, comments, questions, and your ideas for the Messenger friends tab: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:casey@theverge.com\">casey@theverge.com</email></p><p>See Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/2/18526165/facebook-messenger-friends-tab-redesign\">https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/2/18526165/facebook-messenger-friends-tab-redesign</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Casey Newton<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecomp1416360</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W1D-FTV1-F08D-53SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2853\"/><timeReceived>10:50 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 2, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

COAI Members believe there is a crucial need to initiate dialogue and work with the Government of India on this issue\". The COAI has also prepared a white paper on OTT services (read this; we couldn't find the white paper online, and have asked COAI for a copy). Yesterday, the TRAI held a seminar to understand whether an arrangement can be arrived at between Internet services and telecom operators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We spoke with Ankhi Das, Director &amp; Head of Public Policy, Facebook India, about why the company joined the COAI, and their views on COAI's push for regulation of Internet services:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MediaNama: We're trying to understand why Facebook has joined COAI, and what are your views as a member of the COAI on their lobbying efforts, asking the regulator to set up a revenue sharing arrangement between OTT and operators.</p><p>Ankhi Das: Our primary goal is promoting access and we have to work with lots and lots of people in the industry because we can't do it on our own. We have joined COAI as an associate member, not a core member of the COAI. If you look at the associate membership category of COAI, it includes a range of companies from big-tech: there's IBM, all non operator based companies who have an interest in mobile technology. We have joined that category of associate members. You and I both know that in all industry associations you have different varieties of firms that become members and at times members agree, and at times they don't agree. Even in IAMAI, there are firms that agree and those who don't. You work towards resolving those differences, and you reserve the right to disagree.</p><p>Our entire approach and philosophy is: how do we work with different parts of the industry to improve access. There has to be an alignment of incentives for everybody, because different people are making different types of investments, in terms of ensuring that access happens. It's a fact of life that though there is 85% of cellular coverage, only 30% people have access to the Internet. There's a huge gap, and the infrastructure is not keeping pace. How do you de-bottleneck some of these areas. We are more interested in working with operators on advocating on partnerships on things that are common like spectrum sharing, more public investment, and those kind of areas. To bring down the entire discussion into OTT and Operators and revenue sharing is very myopic and small. The main question that needs to be asked is: what are the alignment of incentives which need to happen.</p><p>So what are companies like Facebook doing - I think Google is doing the same. We are investing a huge amount of our engineering resources on the data compression side so there is efficiency and data is delivered faster, cheaper and better, and we are all serving the same goal in terms of promoting access. In my conversations with Rajan Mathews and Vikram (COAI), we've always talked about broad basing the alignment of incentives.</p><p>The entire framing needs to change. It's very reductive to say OTT. We are applications. We thrive on the Internet, whether you, me or NDTV.com. I hate to call it OTT. Bharti Airtel can create its own WAP site through which they can push data. Everyone is playing in the app economy. We need to change the conversation to talk about applications, for newspapers, health and others. Our focus is to engage in these bodies and broaden their horizon.</p><p>MediaNama: What is your take on the telecom industry CEO's going to TRAI, and COAI including a revenue sharing arrangement between telecom operators and OTT as a part of their agenda for the government? Should the government get involved in this? It happened in Broadcast where the TRAI formalized carriage feeds between distributors and broadcasters. Do you want government intervention?</p><p>Ankhi Das: That is not something that we support. We are signatories to various industry papers, and we've had a public position on this consistently. I think the Internet ought to be free. That position will never change. That position is never going to change. It is free, it ought to be free. I doubt how much receptivity is there to these ideas. These are just bad ideas.</p><p>MediaNama: The TRAI organized a seminar full day seminar yesterday, which is probably a pre-cursor to a consultation.</p><p>Ankhi Das: I think these are difficult issues in front of the entire ecosystem. You need to discuss this. It's better to have a discussion than none at all. I do not grudge or misunderstand the need or the anxiety for these discussions. There is just no transparency, and how do we engage? I don't have a problem with consultations or discussions. It helps all the viewpoints come out, and it better than doing something sneaky, behind the scenes. How do we engage without such forums? I don't have a problem with consultation and discussions. It's only through participation in these consultations and associations, where we can have these points of view on the table. We need to look at the ecosystem, and not these narrow, traditional mindset, but look at the how the applications economy is going to evolve, and these are the kinds of innovations and investments we are making to make the data services more efficient. How can we go and advocate together on other promisory instruments?</p><p>MediaNama: As an associate member of the COAI, what sort of representation powers do you have when you're not a core member, which is a position only open to telecom licensees?</p><p>Ankhi Das: That is a question on scope, and how COAI will deal with harmonising these different points of opinion. It's a question best left to, in terms of reconciliation of positions, you should direct to the COAI. In terms of forums, COAI has an associate members committee, and that's the committee which we are members of. It will be fair to compare COAI with TIA, and they are similar. It is an interesting evolution for them.</p><p>MediaNama: But at the same time, when they're going and representing a telecom operator point of view, like they have, your membership adds credence to their claim.</p><p>Ankhi Das: We don't sign up to those representations. That would apply to all associate members who would have interests, and who have application layers. They may not be a social media layer, but they have application layers and services. I would contest that, because it's not an automatic support position. we cannot stop engagement. We cannot stop dialog: we need to engage and educate. That is our philosophy. The sector has to grow by focusing on access, and that is going to happen through an alignment of incentives. OTT's - and first of all I hate that word, and we're all applications on the Internet - we are innovative applications, and by regulating applications, you are absolutely killing innovation. Who knows what is going to come out tomorrow. Imagine if the sector were to be regulated: how can we even conceive what is going to come out.</p><p>MediaNama: One last thing: have you seen this paper on OTT that is being floated by the COAI?</p><p>Ankhi Das: I have not seen it, but now that you have made me aware of it, I am going to ask for it. If there is a white paper being floated, it needs to be put out for consultation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MEDNMA-0011909472</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MEDNMA2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5CVC-CK41-DXMP-K2J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1270\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Media Nama, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Media Nama</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>August 6, 2014 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

However, there is a lot more it should be doing, and its policies remain much weaker than       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">those adopted by Google</url> and Twitter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In his article in The Telegraph, Sir Nick sets the context for these changes by saying that, \"America was deeply divided long before the events of the last few months.\" That's true, but there are people at Facebook who believe that the company is contributing to these divisions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wall Street Journal recently revealed an internal Facebook report from 2016 found that, \"64pc of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools,\" driven by the company's algorithms. \"Our recommendation systems grow the problem.\" </p><p>Two years later, another internal report repeated the warning, stating: \"Our algorithms exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness.\" These reports underline why what happens on Facebook is an increasingly important part in shaping the way many people see the world around them.</p><p>Nick Clegg has also stated that Facebook is setting new policies on political messaging and election campaigning, \"in the absence of government regulation.\" I agree with him that there are aspects of our election law that need to be updated for the digital age, but we should remember that it is already against the law in the UK and America for a foreign person or organisation to pay for advertising for political purposes.</p><p>What the Russians did in 2016 was illegal: the problem was that Facebook was under no legal obligation to prevent it happening. That's why its systems didn't pick up someone from St Petersburg paying in roubles to run adverts targeting voters in Texas.</p><p>In fact, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">when I asked Facebook in 2018</url> whether they thought any similar interference had happened previously in the UK, the company made it quite clear that it was not obliged to look for evidence of this, but would respond to intelligence which proved it was there.</p><p>The problem here is one that goes to the heart of the debate on what the responsibilities of social media companies should be for the activity that takes place on their platforms. In America, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">these companies have consistently lobbied</url> to maintain their \"safe harbour\" status whereby they do not have legal liability for the content that they curate and promote to their users.</p><p>Since Donald Trump became President, these provisions, which are contained in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act</url>, have also been incorporated into the new USA trade agreements with Canada, Mexico and Japan, and the USA would like the same arrangement with the UK, and all with the support of the big tech companies.</p><p>This is something that we cannot allow to happen. So rather than Facebook having to act \"in the absence of government regulation\", this kind of intervention is something that it would do everything in its power to resist.</p><p>When we look at the specifics of the new policies that Facebook has announced, there are some positive changes, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">they fall short of addressing the fundamental problems</url>.</p><p>First, it is right to \"be blocking all ads in the US during the election period from state-controlled media organisations from other countries.\" If by this it means, for example, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">Russian news agencies like RT</url> and Sputnik however, much of their content is shared not through advertising but by people posting and sharing news stories or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">promoting them through Facebook groups</url>.</p><p>Previous investigations have found examples of Facebook groups with hundreds of thousands of members, each sharing content in support of extreme political voices. Also, the fake Russian ads that ran during the 2016 election in America were not placed by \"state-controlled media organisations\", but by shadowy fake campaigners.</p><p>Facebook has previously announced that to run a political advert <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">you have to have proven your identity</url> and location in the process of setting up a Facebook Page. Also, it is their policy that \"All political ads must have a 'paid for by' disclaimer attached to them - a label which will remain on the ad even if it is shared - and information on which voters are being targeted by the ads, and how many saw them, is logged in an ads library for everyone to see.\"</p><p>This is all well and good - but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">Elizabeth Denham, UK Information Commissioner</url>, has previously stated, in evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) select committee, her concerns that it is relatively easy for the true funder of a political campaign to hide their real identity behind a front person who has set up the account.</p><p>We have also seen technical problems with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">Facebook political ad library</url> which crashed for a time during the 2019 UK general election.</p><p>The one genuinely new measure that Facebook has announced is that it will be giving users the choice to turn off political adverts, \"so that they don't see them in their feed - not just in the US but globally from the autumn.\" If by this it means that by changing your personal settings you can stop receiving any political ads, rather than just blocking an individual advertiser, which you could already do, then this is progress.</p><p>I had asked the company's chief technology officer, Mike Schroepfer, when he gave evidence to the DCMS select committee in April 2018, why at that time Facebook wouldn't allow users to do this, and his response was that, \"'if there are advertisers who want to reach all people, it is hard to say, \"No, you can't reach that particular person.\"'</p><p>However, the big reform that Facebook should make, and which YouTube already has, has been avoided: to stop the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">Cambridge Analytica-style micro-targeting</url> of users with political adverts based on detailed analysis of their data. That means even when you choose not to reveal your political affiliations on Facebook, the company can guess what they are anyway and sell that information to advertisers. Of course, Twitter has gone further still and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">banned all political adverts</url> from its platform.</p><p>Last week <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">in his open letter to Facebook</url>, former Vice President Joe Biden called for the company to \"promptly remove false, viral information\" and \"to prevent political candidates and PACs (Political Action Committees) from using paid advertising to spread lies and misinformation.\" Facebook is again not prepared to act on disinformation unless \"it will cause imminent harm or suppress voting\" which, as Nick Clegg has himself admitted, is hard to prove.</p><p>Social media companies should not be required to arbitrate on political debate, but they should have a responsibility to act when people are abusing their systems and advertising tools to deliberately target people at scale with information that is demonstrably not true.</p><p>Last year, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">deep fake film</url> was released of The Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, at a press conference which had been deliberately distorted to make her sound drunk or impaired. YouTube agreed to remove this film,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/17/facebook-preparing-election-like-no/\">but Facebook did not</url>.</p><p>If a similar film was released in the final weeks of the American election campaign to damage one of the candidates, does Facebook really believe that this is a matter of free speech - and should it be left to Facebook to make that decision?</p><p>Fundamentally not enough has changed but other companies are now starting to take steps to act against harmful disinformation that they won't. If you were a bad actor wishing sow division and confusion with campaigns of fear and lies, Facebook would be your social media platform of choice.</p><p>                     Damian Collins is the MP for Folkestone and Hythe and formerly Chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-63721816</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6059-4BS1-JCJY-G00B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1317\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 18, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Mike Lee, R-Utah.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pair talked for about 30 minutes in Lee's office on a number of topics, including a perception of bias against conservatives on Facebook's platform, government regulation, antitrust enforcement, data privacy and federal liability exemption for digital platforms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It went well,\" Lee spokesman Conn Carrol said of the private meeting.</p><p>The private meetings are happening amid antitrust investigations by a House Judiciary subcommittee, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. State attorneys general, including Utah's Sean Reyes, have also launched coordinated probes into whether Big Tech is using its market power to thwart competition and harm consumers.</p><p>Lee, chairman of the Senate Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee, is concerned about antitrust violations, but his harshest criticism has been directed toward the Justice Department and FTC over reports the agencies are squabbling over how to proceed in their separate investigations into Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>During a hearing Tuesday, Lee questioned the government's system of two agencies investigating the companies.</p><p>\"We need robust investigations and enforcement of the antitrust laws, especially in the tech arena. That objective is likely to be hindered if the agencies are stumbling over each other trying to investigate the same companies for the same conduct,\" he said in a statement released Wednesday. \"I wouldn't recommend that (FTC or Justice) get any additional resources until they demonstrate their willingness to put the interests of consumers above their bureaucratic gamesmanship.\"</p><p>Congress has also been debating a privacy law\u00a0that could sharply rein in the ability of digital companies to collect and make money off users' personal data, The Associated Press reported. A national law, which would be the first of its kind in the U.S., could allow people to see or prohibit use of their data.</p><p>Zuckerberg began his rounds Wednesday with Sen. Maria Cantwell, of Washington, the top Democrat on the powerful Senate Commerce Committee. She told Politico she and the Facebook CEO discussed election interference\u00a0on social media, as well as data privacy.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson told Politico that Zuckerberg would discuss ideas for \"future internet regulation\" at the meetings.</p><p>At Facebook's request, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, helped organize a dinner meeting for Zuckerberg and a group of senators.</p><p>\"The participants had a discussion touching on multiple issues, including the role and responsibility of social media platforms in protecting our democracy, and what steps Congress should take to defend our elections, protect consumer data, and encourage competition in the social media space,\" Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for Warner, said in a statement.</p><p>Zuckerberg is also meeting with Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., an outspoken conservative critic of Big Tech, whose proposal to require digital platforms to prove they don't use political bias in filtering content is particularly alarming to tech companies.</p><p>\"Failing to secure a bias-free audit from the government would mean a social media platform loses its long-held immunity from legal action,\" the AP reported.</p><p>Warner and Hawley have also proposed legislation that would strike at the heart of Big Tech's highly profitable business model of gathering data on users habits, and leveraging that information to help advertisers target their messages to specific customers.</p><p>This week's meetings marked Zuckerberg's first public visit to Washington since he testified before Congress last spring about privacy, election interference and other issues.</p><p>In his last visit, Zuckerberg called for \"new rules\" that would tighten regulations to protect consumers' data, control harmful online content, and ensure election integrity and data portability, AP reported.</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mbrown@deseretnews.com\">mbrown@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-46052224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3B-1KC1-DY6J-M00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There was a lot to discuss, so in the spirit of slow news[2], I wanted to take some time to actually digest the plans before opining on it more thoroughly. Nearly all of the immediate reaction to the plan that I saw was not just negative, but mockingly so. Lots of jokes about \"ZuckBucks\" and the most common line of all: \"who would actually trust Facebook with your money.\" </p><p>Having spent time actually reading the white paper, as well as much of the commentary around it, as well as talking to a bunch of different people -- some who are supportive of the program, some who are not at all supportive, and one very knowledgeable friend who basically rated the whole program as a big \"meh\" -- my initial take is that the effort is in many ways a lot more interesting than I expected, but a lot less interesting than I hoped, and I don't think anyone can really have much of a sense of what will become of it until we learn more. More Interesting Than Expected So, let's start with why it's a lot more interesting than I expected. And I'll note that, in addition to reading the white paper, I also highly recommend John Constine's writeup about Libra[3] at TechCrunch, which is by far the most thorough and detailed analysis of the program. So what made Libra more interesting than I expected is that you can tell that a massive amount of effort and thought went into dealing with a single giant question: no one's going to trust this, because no one trusts Facebook. The people designing this clearly knew that their biggest challenge was the fact that there's massive global distrust of Facebook, and really bent over backwards to respond to that. I had kind of expected -- like many big companies -- that the koolaid inside would lead them to pretend that the distrust and hatred directed towards the company wasn't that big of a deal. But, no, it's clear that from the start, this was designed to answer many of the questions raised by \"the... but why would anyone trust Facebook\" question. Indeed, in a big Wired \"behind the scenes\" profile[4] of the Libra project, Libra creator Dave Marcus more or less says exactly that:Marcus, then head of Facebook Messenger, thought he had an answer. He texted his boss and told him it was time to talk about Facebook creating a cryptocurrency, saying that he had a clear view of how to do it, in a way that would earn trust even from those skeptical of Facebook. Marcus spent the next few days writing a memo that laid out his ideas.Later, the article notes:Libra's greatest hurdle may well be overcoming the tarnished reputation of its creator. Marcus knows this, and thinks that the key is making sure that Libra is not synonymous with Facebook.And you can see that in many, many elements of the design. Over and over again you see decisions that effectively take Facebook's vision out of the equation. It's set up an outside non-profit, the Libra Association, which will oversee the project. It's recruiting \"founding members\" who will (mostly) pay $10 million to become a validator node, and Facebook itself will just be a single member with a single vote. In effect, while Facebook is building the initial scaffolding, it's setting the project free from its own direct control. The code is open sourced and can be audited. While Facebook has also set up a separate subsidiary, Calibra, that has built a wallet product that will integrate with various Facebook messaging products, it has isolated Libra information from the rest of the data it collects on you, so this isn't going into the big data bank of info that you already don't trust Facebook to keep private. If you're actually concerned about trusting Facebook, Facebook has made a rather Herculean effort to make it clear that to use Libra you don't actually have to trust Facebook. But, that's only true with two big caveats. First, you have to concern yourself enough to read the details. Not many people are going to do that. Second, you do still need to trust all the other validator node operators, which right now make up a rather motley mix of big organizations. Because unlike most cryptocurrencies where anyone can effectively become a node in the open ledger, Libra made the choice to, at least initially, limit that to a bunch of founding members who will act as nodes. The reasoning behind this design choice is pretty obvious. For one, you can set it up in a way that doesn't have the scaling/energy concerns of a Bitcoin. Also, doing it this way can be seen as less chaotic and subject to questionable behavior as a fully distributed/trustless setup of Bitcoin or Ethereum, but you still have a bunch of large, mostly \"respected\" organizations acting as validator nodes, meaning that for something to go horribly wrong, a bunch of those big organizations would have to all agree to do something really, really bad. And that seems... unlikely. Not impossible. But unlikely. The initial members are an interesting, and slightly eclectic, mix: Payments: Mastercard, PayPal, PayU (Naspers' fintech arm), Stripe, VisaTechnology and marketplaces: Booking Holdings, eBay, Facebook/Calibra, Farfetch, Lyft, Mercado Pago, SpotifyAB, Uber Technologies, Inc.Telecommunications: Iliad, Vodafone GroupBlockchain: Anchorage, Bison Trails, Coinbase, Inc., Xapo Holdings LimitedVenture Capital: Andreessen Horowitz, Breakthrough Initiatives, Ribbit Capital, Thrive Capital, Union Square VenturesNonprofit and multilateral organizations, and academic institutions: Creative Destruction Lab, Kiva, Mercy Corps, Women's World Banking The non-profits don't have to pay the $10 million entry fee. The others do, if they decide to buy in, though the Wired piece notes in passing that this initial list has not actually committed to buying in yet:Actually, all of those are provisional partners. At this point, their participation in the association doesn't mean they've committed to paying $10 million to become a Libra node. The partners seem motivated by curiosity, FOMO, and a shared dream with Facebook that the effort could be both a boon to their ambitions in underserved economies and a milestone in the evolution of digital currency. But they have varying degrees of enthusiasm. As Joshua Gans of the University of Toronto's Creative Destruction Lab, one of the launch partners, puts it, the members have thus far been invited to a kind of constitutional convention. 'It's entirely possible not everyone stays part of the union after that,' he says.Wired also notes that many of these organizations agreed to this in just the last few weeks. And, Facebook has made it clear that its goal is to have 100 members by the actual launch in 2020. In short, the partner list could change a lot. And, as many people have pointed out, that even if they recognize that you don't need to trust Facebook to make use of Libra, they don't trust a lot of those participants. There also aren't any banks. Or any of the other really big tech companies (most of the tech partners are a tier down). How this all shakes out in the long run is going to be very, very important. The other interesting tidbit is that it's clear that the Libra team wanted to deal with the other big issue with many cryptocurrencies: that the volatility makes it mostly useless as a currency, since everyone is using it as a speculative vehicle. Libra is set up so that the currency will be fully backed by a reserve of real assets to make it stable. There are a few other \"stablecoins\" out there, but they're not all that popular and, in some cases, such as with Tether, it's long been accused of being a scam[5] and not actually backed by dollars as promised (accusations that gained more credibility recently[6]). However, given the players backing Libra, and the setup of the program, many of those kinds of concerns can be dealt with. I've seen multiple reports saying that rather than thinking of Libra as another cryptocurrency, it's probably best thought of as another Paypal or Venmo. Indeed, you could say that the only time the cryptocurrency/blockchain part matters is for getting the currency out of Facebook's ecosystem. That is, if you use Calibra inside of a Facebook service, it's really little more than an internal currency. What's partly interesting, is that if you want to then move it out of Facebook's control, then the blockchain aspect takes over and you get to extract yourself. That's good. But, to me, the better comparison, rather than Paypal or Venmo, is really WeChat in China. The whole Libra setup (as well as Calibra) seems like a fairly obvious attempt to recreate what WeChat has done. If you're not familiar with it, WeChat is not just like the Facebook of China, it's the everything China. People pay for nearly everything directly within WeChat. Without WeChat in China you basically can't do anything. It seems pretty clear that Libra is an attempt to try to build that kind of functionality into Facebook, and to do it in a way that the currency aspect flows smoothly, without too much friction. That's interesting in a lot of ways, because there's been a lot of innovation coming out of WeChat, and showing what can be done when you integrate connectivity with currency. Less Interesting Than Hoped However, that last point is also why this whole thing is a lot less interesting than I hoped. Recreating what WeChat has done in China, and doing so in a way that is more open, and with less control by Facebook is interesting -- and if it's actually adopted could lead to some new innovations. But it's not nearly as far as I had hoped Facebook might go. I've been talking about this protocols instead of platforms[7] concept for a while now -- and one element that could make that work is a better cryptocurrency or tokenization system that would open up new business models that don't rely on advertising. And I had hoped that Facebook's foray into cryptocurrency might include that element. But it clearly does not. While part of Libra is the new Move programming language[8] that will let people develop on top of the Libra blockchain, this does not seem designed for a world of protocols instead of platforms. It's very much about integrating money into existing platforms. That's understandable, but disappointing. That's not to say Libra isn't ambitious and couldn't lead to more interesting things down the road, but on the Clayton Christensen spectrum of sustaining to disruptive innovations, this looks like it hues much more towards a sustaining innovation. It's a platform to add new features into existing systems, rather than a new way of organizing the world. It could still have a big impact. But it could have done a lot more. And, frankly, as I'll discuss in the next section, I think the failure to go this far has the greatest chance of holding Libra back in the long run. Since so much of Libra is about layering on payments to what's out there already that just opens up Facebook to lots of criticism and potential regulatory hurdles. If Facebook had, instead, tried to restart its own setup as a cryptocurrency-based protocol, focused much more on the protocol service building, rather than the currency, the regulatory response likely would have been quite different. Indeed, turning its platform into a protocol would have been, in effect, Facebook breaking itself up. While Facebook took a bold approach with Libra in effectively taking its own power out of the equation to empower all the Libra Association Members, it's only doing that for this payments layer -- not for its underlying structure. Lots of reasons to be skeptical: In the end, while this is an interesting and ambitious project, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical. While Facebook did bend over backwards to try to pre-answer the \"but who would ever trust Facebook with money\" question, how many people are actually going to take the time to understand that? At least based on the initial reactions I saw online, the answer is: not many. And, of course the bigger threat are regulators. New York Magazine noted that, in the end, this seems to be Facebook trying to compete with the US dollar[9] to become the global reserve currency. And governments sure aren't going to like that. And they're already pissed off about Facebook in general. So the idea that grandstanding politicians are going to take the time to understand that Facebook has mostly taken its own trust issues out of the equation is likely a non-starter. European regulators are already flipping out[10] and the US Congress is already setting up hearings[11]. The whole effort may be crushed by regulators before it even really begins. And then, of course, there's the distinct possibility that even if this does get off the ground, no one might actually use it. Yes, Facebook has a massive base to start with. Yes, there's lots of publicity and I'm sure Calibra can pull lots of tricks to incentivize usage. But, getting people to buy into new payments is something of a crapshoot. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. And the biggest platform doesn't always win. People may not remember, but PayPal's initial success was facilitating payments on eBay. eBay then came up with its own competitor to PayPal, and you might think that, given its own dominance and platform that it would take over -- but that didn't happen. eBay ended up having to buy PayPal because its own competitor flopped. The other big challenge is actually getting however many members of the Libra Association actually on the same page. It's not hard to see how different visions and in-fighting could mess up the entire project as well. So while there are plenty of interesting things here, there's plenty that could go wrong. And, frankly, I'm disappointed that the project's ambition wasn't nearly as disruptive as it could have been. Of course, you never know what the future might hold. And, at least one person is already trying to setup their own version[12] of the Libra blockchain that doesn't involve the Libra Association, but is actually fully distributed and \"privacy oriented.\" Wouldn't it be fascinating if Libra actually took off by a forked version that does an end-run around all those giant companies?Permalink[13] | Comments[14] | Email This Story[15] [ 1]:
