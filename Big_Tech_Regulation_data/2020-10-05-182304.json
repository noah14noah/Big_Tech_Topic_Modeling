Not just in UK politics, but also for a number of trade bodies in communications, PR and media monitoring. From AMEC and the PRCA, to FIBEP, ICCO, PRSA - there are plenty of awards and some reflections on where we've come from, where we are, and where we are likely to be going. Fake news remains the centre of attention and is the starting topic of discussion in episode 12 of The Small Data Forum podcast[4]. This episode's show notes were written by Thomas Stoeckle[5].Tuesday's New York Times ran the story How Russia Harvested American Rage to Reshape US Politics.[6]As an issue that affects the democratic process in Western societies, this continues to have the mainstream media in its thrall. </p><p>It has, as Sam puts it, 'upset the liberal apple cart.' We see political fringes energised on either side of the spectrum. Bases are activated and undecideds flipped. This could be seen as healthy democracy in action if it wasn't for the 'cultural hacking' that Columbia researcher Jonathan Albright has uncovered: feeding and amplifying existing outrage to influence political movements (Fast Company published a good overview[7] this week). When we thought extremism had been dealt with through the Blair, Clinton and Schroeder years, we now appear to plunge back into tribal instincts. In this context, Sam mentions Christiane Amanpour's masterful analysis How to seek truth in the era of fake news[8] in a recent TED discussion with Chris Anderson. For Neville, this goes way beyond politics. It is more like a malaise permeating society. A recent poll by the BBC across 18 countries suggests that worries are growing[9]. However, concerns cut both ways, with 79% of respondents worried about fake news, yet 58% opposing regulation. 'Technology needs a moral compass', in Christiane Amanpour's words. The problem of technology versus humanity was also a key point of Gerd Leonhard's[10] keynote at Bora-Co's[11] #BreakOut17 event last week, about ethical codes for a digital age. What is permissible and what crosses lines? When does the internalizing of gains and externalizing of costs go too far?How much fake is too much fake?It makes one wonder why this would be such a big deal all of a sudden when we have lived with advertising for well over a century. Edward Bernays and his 'torches of freedom[12]' come to mind. Also, political polarization in politics is nothing new, and neither is investigative journalism. But now we have to add to that the human instinct to hoax and trick other people, with the boundaries between fake and fact blurring. Sam asks if fake funny pictures are a problem, or whether there might be a hierarchy of problems. Neville points out that this is about human behaviour, which brings us to incentives, and to intent. For Sam, a lot of this is about earning real ad dollars through gaming programmatic advertising (which he feels GDPR could sink overnight; we will come back to that). And in the political arena, the apology is always weaker than the effect of the fib. There is general acceleration - of fakery, and of rebuttal. For example, in the case of the Las Vegas shooting, false claims about the shooter Stephen Paddock, exposure, then take down. All within 24 hours. Neville is skeptical. He feels that humanity lacks this self-cleaning function. It is a valid question: How can we evolve to become critical fact checkers and verifiers, from being cat video lovers at best, mendacious trolls at worst?GDPR: Risk and Opportunity Knock The second half of this episode focuses on the European General Data Protection Regulation[13] (GDPR), which will come into force on May 25, 2018. It will change how businesses and public sector organisations can handle the information of their customers. The idea is to harmonise data privacy laws across Europe, as well as give greater protection and rights to individuals. GDPR will replace the no longer fit for purpose Data Protection Directive from 1995 (when the most valuable internet companies were the likes of Netscape, Yahoo and Web.com). Sam explains the wider context, and the urgency: with GDPR just over six months away, organisations need to have their corresponding data policy in place. The role of the data protection officer will become mandatory throughout the EU. Where companies are found to be in breach of GDPR, it will cost real money. Neville thinks that most companies are not ready. According to a PwC report quoted in Computer Weekly[14] recently, organisations are not paying enough attention to technology. A lot of IT equipment, both software and hardware, will not be fit for the new purpose. Data, to Sam, is simply everywhere in the chain: from social media to CRM to programmatic advertising. GDPR works from the principle that we own our personal data, not the big tech companies. The right to be forgotten will significantly impact the data aggregation industry, as well as real time programmatic ad buying and serving. In future, this will require a data trail for every individual in the chain. And Brexit does not make this irrelevant. It is about data of EU citizens. And if you do business in the EU, this applies to you. A side effect of GDPR is the formation of a whole army of consultants, waiting in the wings, ready to monetize this new uncertainty. Businesses and organisations need help to prepare for the changes. And then they need help with compliance, to avoid hefty fines.We conclude our discussions by putting this European initiative in global perspective.Arguably technology innovation, realising opportunities arising from AI and machine learning advancements, are driven by the US and by China. How will the EU's GDPR regulation effort affect the centre of gravity? In June, Wired Magazine ran a feature on EU Commissioner Margarete Verstager, 'the woman deciding Google's fate[15]'. Tax bills, antitrust rules and GDPR are all impacting the future of the big technology firms. Sam raises the possibility of nationalized ownership and governance structures, perhaps in the context of global public ownership. Which prompts Neville's question about China: what is their longer term play? We briefly touch on China's Orwellian Behavior Grading Scheme[16], which hit the headlines last year. Different countries, with different political systems, play to different rules. In an increasingly interconnected, globalised world, this comes with its own often unintended consequences. The SmallDataForum will continue to observe, and comment.Listen to the Show://html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/5834941/height/90/width/700/theme/custom/autonext/no/thumbnail/yes/autoplay/no/preload/no/no_addthis/no/direction/forward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/[17] Share your comments or questions about this podcast, or suggestions for discussion topics, in the online Small Data Forum community on LinkedIn[18] Don't miss any episode - subscribe: RSS[19] | iTunes[20] Thomas Stoeckle[21] leads strategic business development at LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions (BIS).

It is more than a little ironic that this is originally a Russian proverb (Doveryai, no proveryai[3]). Trust is also what links the various topics in episode 13 of our podcast (with show notes written by Thomas Stoeckle[4]). From Chinese citizen scores to alleged irregularities in the UK referendum and the US presidential election, the implications of GDPR and the prospects of blockchain: trust is the glue that should hold together the fabric of such interactions, in private as well as public contexts.China scores its citizensWriter and academic Rachel Botsman calls her analysis of our hyperconnected, hyperpartisan times Who Can You Trust[5]. Both Neville and I are currently reading the book, and it will feature in our next podcast (by which time I suspect Sam might also be among the readers). It first caught our attention in the form of an article[6] in Wired magazine, discussing the Chinese citizen score in some depth (as an excerpt from the book). A powerful piece which Sam calls 'ideologically driven'. There is something binary about the collectivist vs individualist perspective that he detects, reminiscent of the communist vs capitalist paradigm of the Cold War era. </p><p>This is all about the vision of the Chinese government to develop a social credit system to rate all citizens on trust and build a culture of sincerity. The article quotes from the original policy document: 'It will forge a public opinion environment where keeping trust is glorious. It will strengthen sincerity in government affairs, commercial sincerity, social sincerity and the construction of judicial credibility.' Neville notices the aspect of 'gamified obedience' described by Botsman: Amazon or Netflix style user transparency, yet with a kind of Orwellian political purpose: capitalist can-do, but with Communist Party oversight. Tencent and Alibaba, two of the leading Chinese technology companies, are part of the current test phase. What is gamified is also susceptible to gaming: this example of the Sesame credit score[7] shows the tight connection between government intentions and commercial (self)interests.We discuss the somewhat dystopian 'Orwell's 1984 meets Pavlov's dogs' scenario, conscious that this really isn't a million miles away from the obsession with ratings and rankings that is also prevalent in Western social media use. Whether it is Facebook likes or Twitter followers, the latest scores from our Fitbit, the hyperbolic promises of the quantified self and the Internet of Things - datafication and gamification are here to stay.US Senate Hearings with Facebook, Google and TwitterBig Brother's use of big data was also the focus of US Senate Hearings into the role of big tech companies in the 2016 presidential elections. The Wall Street Journal[8] described it as industry conglomerates' rites of passage: similar to railroad barons, oil, pharma, tobacco and banking giants before - presenting themselves to Capitol Hill to ask forgiveness for their trespasses. Or in this case, to explain the fake news and misinformation impact on the 2016 election. A comprehensive write-up[9] can be found in The Atlantic, by the exceptionally well-informed Alex Madrigal. Recently published research[10] by two American communication scholars, Shannon McGregor ...niel Kreiss, highlights the role of tech firms in the 2016 US presidential elections. A related Vice article[11] makes this very explicit: 'All major tech platforms now employ significant ad sales staff based in DC to take advantage of congressional and presidential election cycles.' Neville is surprised at the sheer scale and opacity of political involvement on behalf of the big tech firms. His plea for greater transparency requires investigative journalism joining forces with citizen journalists, something we see at play when journalists such as Carole Cadwalladr[12] ask the Twitter collective[13] to help verify and corroborate a story[14]. Reflecting on the use and abuse of data, Sam recalls a recent talk by Guy Standing, author of The Precariat[15]. The precariat [16]is a new social class, constantly faced with uncertainty over their future, knowledgeable and with access to information, yet without direction and purpose. They can be found on the right (as atavists, looking backwards and being amenable to right-wing populism) and on the left (as progressives, seeking utopia). Demagogues are tapping into this Zeitgeist, and the likes of Facebook, Google and Twitter earn good money from facilitating.Optimists and PessimistsNeville calls this a moral maze, and quotes a recent Nieman Labs article[17] about a study based on interviews with internet and tech experts, and their views on solving the fake news and misinformation crisis. The consensus was - there is no consensus. There is an almost even split between optimists (those who see the glass half full, who believe in human nature and the power of technology to fix the problems), and pessimists (those who see the glass half empty, who worry about primal instincts and the fact that our brains aren't wired to cope with the pace of technological change). Digital Populism in GermanyMeanwhile, Germany is coming to terms with the fact that for the first time since the 1960s[18], a far-right party is represented in parliament. Research by Reuters Institute for Journalism[19] showed that that right-leaning media (especially digital only channels) generated much more engagement than their limited posting activity and reach would suggest. Which means they were pretty good at hitting the sweet spot of their target audience. It is clear that Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland (AfD) ran the most digitally savvy campaign of all the German political parties. A Guardian article[20] stated that AfD's massive vote gains reflect the extreme right's ability to conquer online space and win the information war with sophisticated obfuscation and disruption tactics. According to The Atlantic[21], they had competent support from the US in Harris Media, a conservative leaning communications and digital strategy firm that worked for Donald Trump, for Sarah Palin, but also for UKIP in the run up to Brexit.GDPR is Coming FastWhilst everybody is trying to figure out what political lessons to learn from recent events, whether and how more regulation is required to serve both public, and private interests - GDPR is drawing closer, and Neville reminds us that it is really only 200 days away (at the time of writing this post, pretty much exactly 200 days and 12 hours[22]). Plenty of companies are not ready[23], and they don't seem to grasp the breadth and depth of record keeping requirements, of proof of compliance and the need for a data protection officer and the risk of hefty fines. Businesses in the marketing and communications space also need navigate between the roles of data controller or data processor, as outlined in this useful guide[24]. An informative and insightful polemic by marketing expert Samuel Scott in The Drum[25] provided Sam with a favourite digital marketing quote, by Doc Searls: 'Madison Avenue fell asleep, direct response marketing ate its brain, and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.' What used to be the creative process of storytelling become a digital marketers' numbers game. But now, Sam muses, with the potentially compounding effects of adblocking, GDPR and ePrivacy[26] on programmatic real time targeting, it might just be that advertising and communications will have to go back to the quality of creative.Blockchain - Hype or Hard Fact?Our final topic of this episode is blockchain, which according to the Gartner hype cycle[27] is past the 'peak of inflated expectations,' and heading into the 'trough of disillusionment[28].' Sam reflects on the almost Communist idea behind it, the promise of radical democracy. Harvard Business Review published 'The Truth About Blockchain[29]' recently, and that truth seems to be that blockchain is coming, but not over night: it is a foundational, rather than a disruptive technology. Its impact on economic and other social systems will be huge, and its adoption gradual. Neville points out that the coverage of blockchain is mainly driven by hugely technical explanations. We would all benefit from better understanding, and a good starting point might be this 3,500 word 'plain English guide' on The Next Web[30]. And yet blockchain isn't even the latest cry in 'distributed ledger technology'. That epithet goes to hashgraph[31], which is said to be safer, faster and cheaper to run. Yet as Sam rightly observers, the history of bubbles and market crashes[32] is long and rich.Future TopicsWe will continue to observe and discuss, and it doesn't seem as if we might be running out of topics any time soon. Facial recognition is evolving in leaps and bounds - with China again the main driving force, with the least restrictions (this 6 minute Economist video[33] is instructive). And, talking of moral mazes, there is the baffling case[34] of Saudi Arabia granting citizenship to Sophia the robot. But that's for episode 14.

Now into the month named after him, the SmallDataForum reviews its predictions and looks at the year ahead. Will Europe 'take back control', or will commercial pressures curb big tech's enthusiasm? Will 2018 be the breakthrough year for chatbots and DPAs (digital personal assistants), both in business and personal use?</p><p> How will continuous technological and economic transformations affect connections between people? This episode's show notes were written by Thomas Stoeckle[4].What next in AI?Neville expects speech recognition and speech generation to go mainstream in 2018[5], as the three of us share our personal experiences with virtual assistants and voice search. At CES Las Vegas this week, voice assisted consumer home solutions will the big thing[6], and voice enabled AI assistants for automobiles[7] are the next frontier. The continuous advancement of AI solutions also brings continuous reflections on the flipside of the (bit)coin: the costs that come with the benefits, desired and undesired, intended and unintended consequences (even Gartner's predictions for 2018 and beyond[8] mix utopia with dystopia). When AI generated images of fake persons start to fool the AI systems in place to spot them, we can already see the next stage of an AI arms race between deception and detection[9]. What next with fake newsOn the topic of misinformation and fake news, Sam sees a growing sense of responsibility for technology firms, in particular in Europe and driven by social-democratic thinking, which leans more toward regulation and societal interest, than unregulated free enterprise. However, rather than government intervention, he expects increased commercial pressures to get the likes of Google and Facebook to take the required responsibility for solving the problem. Diageo pulling all their ads from Snapchat[10] over age verification concerns is a case in point. Marketers' response to the fake news challenge, according to a study by The Society for New Communications Research of The Conference Board (SNCR[11]), which Neville helped conduct, revealed ambivalence as well as reluctance[12]: ambivalence about what ought to change, and reluctance to alter their own business practices. There is concern about lack of control of where ads are running, and also about the potential gaming of ad technology. Sam sees responsibility of where ads are running with the publishers and the media agencies, not the brands. Neville believes that everyone who participates in this ecosystem has a part to play in finding a solution. I think the bigger story here is about the fundamental drivers of the attention economy and influence industry, and how the shift from more linear broadcasting business models toward modern systemic interdependent models might redefine how responsibility is allocated. Roger McNamee[13], an early investor in Facebook and all-round technology sage, published this very comprehensive essay[14] recently about the challenges arising from the - until now - laissez-faire approach to regulation towards Silicon Valley, and the big internet platforms in particular.How Europe might take (back) controlMeanwhile, with GDPR only a few months away, and the contamination of our information ecosystem continuing unabated, privacy and security[15] remain high on the tech story agenda. In 2018, European attempts at reining in tech will focus on the five areas of anti-trust litigation[16], data storage and privacy laws[17], labour laws to reign in the gig economy[18], national security[19] (on country, and European level), and tax law[20]. Dr. Damian Tambini, of the London School of Economics Trust, Truth and Technology (T3) Commission[21], sees 2018 as the year in which liberal democracies begin to confront misinformation[22]. President Macron in France has just announced a law against fake news[23], and Germany's new legislation against online hate speech[24] is applied to both sides of the political divide. In the meantime, the UK engages in stern finger wagging[25]. Regulation - either by the state, or by the businesses themselves, is just one of at least three main areas: to address the problem adequately, it needs to be clearly understood and defined first. The study on Information Disorder[26] by First Draft's[27] Claire Wardle and Hossein Derakhshan[28] (commissioned and published by the Council of Europe[29]) goes a long way in meeting that part of the challenge. Education key to address tech challengesEducation is the third critical element, and whilst media literacy[30] is essential, it won't suffice[31]. With technology evolving in leaps and bounds, transforming economies and societies in the process, education systems can't keep up and Sam sees an education and talent crunch as a fundamental issue for commercial communicators. The war on digital talent[32] is in full swing as not nearly enough people know nearly enough about any of the technologies and tools that will drive marketing success. This will be an ongoing theme throughout 2018, and conversations will focus on new concepts and models of collaboration and interaction to match shifts in behaviour - in society and in business. Interpersonal trust and loyalty will become key factors not just in our personal lives (where this is nothing new), but also in our professional relationships. Neville calls it 'the new normal', very much in line with Rachel Botsman's[33] work on collaboration, loyalty and trust - which we will discuss further in the next episode.

'If a tree falls in a forest, and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?' A modern version of this 18th century thought experiment by the philosopher and cleric George Berkeley might read: 'If the EU fines a big tech firm billions of dollars, and no one has the power to enforce it, has it actually happened?' A recent opinion piece on AdExchanger[2] discussed the connection between Google's $5bn antitrust fine, and the enforcement of fines for GDPR non-compliance. Europe is committed to taking a stand against corporations when it comes to privacy rights of consumers[3], intellectual property rights of content producers (although the planned law is controversial[4]), and anti-competitive market positions[5].But there is potential tension between the goal of harmonizing privacy law across EU member states, and implementation and enforcement of the law on national level, where the regulation applies. </p><p>Consumer protection has a different priority in different European countries, and even more so when comparing Europe with the US or China, say. That's why the EU Commissioner for Competition, Margarete Vestager, is seen by some as the spearhead of the only global regulator really standing up[6] to arrogant American tech giants, and by others - not least the current US President[7] - as a busybody trying to suffocate innovative tech businesses. We see a 'commercial culture clash' between Europe and US, between consumer protection and the right of corporations. And what about China, which keeps working on its modern, global Silk Road[8], investing $1tn in physical infrastructure, while keeping its digital infrastructure in a walled garden, with Alibaba and Tencent being active and successful on the global stage? Big questions for the SmallDataForum, as always. And on the topic of the EU's role and potential impact, we agree: Sam is optimistic in describing how the world uses EU regulatory frameworks in trading. 28 countries (or perhaps 27 soon), plus many more internationally are actively following EU standards. Neville confirms that in Europe, there is greater appetite for privacy rights, than in the US.I see the EU playing a long game, bringing together a number of pillars to create a more integrated framework of regulations to manage and balance the interests of consumers and corporations across personal data (GDPR), electronic communication (ePrivacy), digital copyright and antitrust issues - although some observers only see the smothering of creativity and innovation[9]. These are complex and multi-faceted issues. On the topic of intellectual property, social media and the impact on communicators, the Institute for Public Relations'[10] legal expert Cayce Myers published a very informative and relevant piece recently about the challenges around the EU's copyright reform[11]. As GDPR is becoming more of a routine part of businesses' and organisations' compliance activities, Sam notes that the implementation so far has passed without major incidents. Programmatic advertising needed to clean itself up, and according to DigiDay, GDPR is buoying both programmatic guaranteed deals[12], and contextual (rather than personal profile based) targeting[13]. Neville points to the thorny issue of managing consent[14] across a supply chain of users, ad buyers and publishers. We all better learn 'WTF is a consent string?'[15] In our 'let's all get a little more paranoid' section, we discuss Alexa's overzealous listening skills, as well as the murky world of fake followers and inflated reach and engagement metrics across the board of apps and platforms. As always, cranky marketing sage Mark Ritson has a pertinent point[16] on the matter. Neville sees this as an opportunity for communicators to provide direction and guidance.We round up episode 20 of the SDF with a look at the key findings of the Digital News Report 2018[17] by the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism. As Neville very rightly points out, every communicator needs to study this in detail (findings based on a survey of more than 74,000 online news consumers in 37 countries), and we could only touch on a few highlights[18] such as the decline of social media use for news in some key markets such as the US, the UK, Brazil and France. This appears to be largely due to reduced news consumption via Facebook (where changes to Facebook's news algorithm[19] play a significant role). Another key finding points to a general sense that the main responsibility for tackling the fake news problem lies with publishers and platforms - very much aligned with findings from a SNCR study[20] in December 2017. The online news landscape keeps evolving rapidly, and overall the Reuters report is optimistic about the news industry.

Until November 2017, Thomas led strategic business development at LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions (BIS). Prior to joining LexisNexis, he was group director and global analytics lead at W2O Group, and managing director at Report International (now CARMA). A marketing communications researcher and business leader with 20-plus years' experience in helping clients make sense of their global (social) media footprint, and how that affects perception and reputation, he believes passionately in meaning and insightful business story-telling through robust data evidence and compelling visualisation. Originally from Germany, Thomas has been living and working in London for more than 16 years. A digital Neanderthal among digital natives, he is keenly aware that adequate solutions to communications problems demand fluency in the three languages of humans, machines, and business.

In talking about various aspects of the attention economy, we managed to hold each other's attention for a good 45 minutes. This episode's show notes were written by Thomas Stoeckle[1]. Many 'attention economists' these days quote Nobel Laureate Herbert Simon[2] and his observation that a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention. It is certainly a quote that has aged well, and one can only wonder what Simon would make of the world now, 47 years on from his famous statement. </p><p>Sam doesn't quite see the crisis of attention that brands often lament. But quality and controllability matter more than ever, and producers of content - especially the advertising and media industries - need to up their game to stay relevant. Users control their online experience through ad blockers and subscription services to filter out interruptive commercial communication. Yes, we like to communicate, but on our terms and with others of our choosing. And for content to be worthy of our attention, it needs to be accessible, usable and shareable. Or at least funny.The role of advertising and marketing has become one of the central themes of our modern tech debates. It is a theme with a long shadow, as Tim Wu's[3] history of the Attention Merchants[4] eloquently illustrates. How much has really changed from the days of PT Barnum[5] and 'there's a sucker born every minute[6]', to today's seemingly unstoppable datafication[7]? Almost everything, and at the same time very little. This is also the theme of a powerful recent article in The Atlantic[8], Welcome to the Age of Privacy Nihilism[9]. Neville points our attention to the main conclusion: The real difference between the old and the new ages of data-intelligence-driven consumer marketing, and the invasion of privacy they entail, is that lots of people are finally aware that it is taking place. The Cambridge Analytica scandal, the recent reports about Google, and related events have contributed to that knowledge, but not as much as the barrage of rapidly correlated advertising served in apps and on web pages. The postal mail comes once a day, but people see hundreds or thousands of new renditions of their own private information in the same time on online. It's easy to mistake the proximate cause\u2014big, shadowy tech firms\u2014for the ultimate one: over half a century of business-intelligence techniques that have been honed, productized, and weaponized out of sight. Google and Facebook are just the tip of an old, hardened iceberg. So yes, the attention economy (first introduced as a concept by Davenport and Beck[10] in 2001) is here. But crisis - well it depends on the context. We talk about Netflix, and how people in their subscription-funded walled gardens would rebel against non consumption behaviour-related 'nudges'. Netflix have started to experiment with advertising and promos for other shows between episodes, and the reaction is mixed[11]. We all want just the stuff we care about. The word meaningful gets used a lot these days. But who defines meaningful, and for whom? Do we want to rely on Mark Zuckerberg's idea of 'meaningful social interactions' and 'time well spent' - concepts that apparently drove the overhaul of the Facebook News Feed algorithms earlier this year[12]? Personally, I'd rather follow the originator of the phrase 'time well spent[13]', Tristan Harris[14], and the concepts and ideas developed in the Center for Humane Technology[15]. If data is indeed 'everywhere and nowhere' and there is no escape, if the big data algorithmic ad ecosystem knows our every step, if we are continuously 'nudged', what happens to free will and choice? Neville is less worried since the retargeting algorithms are still dumb: they don't anticipate, they just amplify what's already there as observable online reality. But where might this be going? Sam imagines his smartphone hearing him chant at a match of his football team, and soon serving up ads for the next FIFA game, as well as fan merchandise for his son. But is, as Neville suggests, data hoovering and blunt nudging no longer acceptable? It is true, awareness levels have increased significantly, thanks to Cambridge Analytica, GDPR and other headline-grabbing data and privacy stories. But then, as the story in The Atlantic reminded us, targeted relational database marketing has been a big deal for a long while - so how and why would it now be illegitimate or illegal?Difficult questions, but thankfully there are people with very simple answers, as Sam reminds us when he mentions Donald Trump's attack on Google's apparently liberal bias. Perhaps he will soon back GDPR to be imposed across the US, and especially on Silicon Valley? This recent piece in The Observer[16] discusses how big tech finds itself in an uncomfortable place, being pressured both from the left and from the right. Certainly a theme for the SmallDataForum to keep an eye on. Talking of perspective (largely) from the left - I got a good dose of that at Byline Festival[17] at the Bank Holiday weekend, where the 'Spirit of '68' inspired attendees to 'dance, discuss, laugh and change the world'. Up for discussion was everything from Brexit and Trump, to fake news and our global information disorder, corporate surveillance, the fifth battlespace, the rise of the alt-right, Russian disinformaziya, Silicon Valley's threat to our democracy, digital rights and how to deal with Anti-semitism and Islamophobia. And the list goes on. A glut of important and difficult questions meeting a dearth of answers. Not that there aren't any (or at least good suggestions). The tech journalist and author Jamie Bartlett shared some of the ideas from his book The People vs Tech[18], which offers a dystopian and a utopian scenario: either big tech will destroy Western democracy as we know it, or Western civilization and democracy will find a way to regulate and rein in tech. Solutions centre around how to treat the big platforms: as publishers? As utilities? Should they be subject to safety regulation similar to the aviation industry or the pharma industry? Perhaps Byline Fest 2019 will have the answers. Next in our budding book club was Robert Peston's 'WTF?[19]', which Sam read recently. Plenty of discussion of SmallDataForum topics, amid broad themes such as a inequality and a decline in social mobility. And leading to economically-grounded, utopian perspectives such as a universal living wage. Neville's summer reading consisted mainly of post-apocalyptic novels[20], a metaphor for this day and age and modern versions of classic stories structured around Joseph Campbell's hero's journey, e.g. trying not to fall off the Brexit precipice. We finished on a ROFL as we pondered P... plan to trademark youth-speak and texting acronyms. This Campaign article[21] provides some good perspective. LMFAO? WTF indeed.

So the famous US Supreme Court Justice and 'crusader for social justice' and breaker-upper of Gilded Age monopolies,Louis D. Brandeis[1]is said to have said,perhaps sometime in the early 1930s[2].Today, perhaps the best-knownneo-Brandeisian[3]anti-trust advocate is Tim Wu, Columbia law professor, 'father of net neutrality'[4]and author of a series of books likening today's commercial excesses - in particular in the digital space - to the 'Gilded Age' of the late 19thand early 20thcenturies.Of course, it is not really an either-or debate. It's a complex and convoluted, tangled web of interests and angles, and any claimant of simple solutions has likely got a degree from snake oil university.Neville discusses an article inThe Conversation[5]by De Montford University professor Eerke Boiten, who advocates GDPR-based impact assessments to hold tech firms accountable, rather than letting them continue to 'move fast and break things'. Jeff Jarvis, CUNY journalism professor, takes a very different stance in his recent EU regulation critiqueEurope Against the Net[6].In our latest discussion about Facebook, GDPR and general big tech regulation issues, Neville, Sam and I come down on different sides of the either-or debate of public vs business interest.Ladies and gentlemen: The Battle of the Unintended Consequences!</p><p> In the left corner, the defenders of a free market and an internet that must not be curbed. In the right corner, the wardens of democracy, privacy and free will. Both Neville and Sam, in line with Jarvis, rightly point to the dangers of regulatory overreach. Baby, bath water etc.They are right. And yet. To both Neville and Sam (and Jeff Jarvis), my inner Rhett Butler responds 'frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'. Not just in this latest, episode 26 of our SDF podcast, I find myself somewhat closer to the right corner of this particular battle, than my two co-podcasters.Which is not to say that we don't agree on most things. We do. For example, on the recentDisinformation and 'Fake News'[7]report by the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee (DCMS), which likens Facebook and its leading executives to 'digital gangsters[8]'.Ah, Facebook. Never-ending fountain of discussion points for our little discussion group. For all its not very well hidden greed and cack-handed public appearances, the numbers are the numbers, and the shareholders won't complain about thelatest record-breaking quarter[9]. Will things ever change?Neville points to European countries turning the screws, fromFrance fining Google[10], to German legislators putting pressure onFacebook and its WhatsApp integration[11], to the British government mullingdrastic fines for the digital platforms[12]if they continue to fail to eradicate harmful content. DCMS chairman Damian Collins is certainly right when he states that tech firms 'listen with their wallets'.Sam agrees, and at the same time feels that Facebook (and Google) are way ahead of lawmakers - and how is that ever going to change? His prediction: it's not so much the lawmakers the big advertising money-gobbling platforms should fear. It's the fact that sooner or later, advertisers won't put up with the walled garden principle any more.Yes brand safety might be an issue, but not as big as unreliable, unproveable metrics when it comes to proving return on marketing investment. Which also means that with demonstrable return, there will be little desire to rock the boat. It's business, after all.It is indeed. Very big business. Which brings me back to Tim Wu, and his latest book,The Curse of Bigness[13]. It continues and sharpens an argument that Wu has made first in his 2011 work,The Master Switch[14], and then 2016, inThe Attention Merchants[15]. The power of monopolies and trusts, the commercialization of attention, unfettered global capitalism - for Wu, it has reached a point that's very similar to what the US in particular went through in the early 20thcentury.Big topics for the SmallDataForum. Central, essential topics, and never better articulated than in Shoshana Zuboff's thesis of surveillance capitalism. First publicly articulated inFrankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2016[16], it has now been published as an almost 700 page tome, and likened to the works of Adam Smith, Max Weber and Karl Marx byJohn Naughton in The Observer[17].Like Wu, Zuboffs draws the comparison to the Gilded Age of the late 19thand early 20thcenturies. And just like then, this is about knowledge, and power. Zuboff calls this the essential questions: 'Who knows? Who decides? Who decides who decides?'Her central argument is about the 'instrumentation and instrumentalization of behavior for the purposes of modification, prediction, monetization, and control.' Regular listeners will have heard us many times use the phrase 'if you don't pay for the product, you are the product'. Zuboff has turned it into profound, and profoundly researched argument.Essentially, our freely available social media data becomes behavioural data which is turned into predictions of future behaviour, and sold to advertisers to optimise the marketing funnel. And as Sam has argued, in a business sense, that would make the stakeholders in the business process happy.Cision's recent acquisition of Trendkite is interesting in this context. We agree that a quasi-monopoly in the communication measurement and evaluation space isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it might help with standardisation in a space that has been dominated by pseudo-scientific quibbles over the better PR value of articles for way too long.The employees recentlylaid off due to restructuring[18]will probably disagree. Cision's ambition to become 'one of the most important cloud technology players in the entire industry' makes them a player in Zuboff's behavioural futures market. Where that leads - will be the topic of future podcasts.So, finally, to the Brexit Hokey Cokey: in, out, shake it all about. By the time of SDF27, something important will have happened. Or not.Another comparison between now and more than 100 years ago is the idea of lions led by donkeys. Surely there can't be a better illustration of the trials and tribulations of Brexit, than the revealing tweets that the four dads who run the Twitter handle@ByDonkeys[19]keep serving up as real-world posters.By that account, at least British humour still works.Listen to episode 26//html5-player.libsyn.com/embed/episode/id/8858165/height/90/theme/custom/thumbnail/yes/direction/backward/render-playlist/no/custom-color/87A93A/[20];This episode's show notes were written byThomas Stoeckle. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasstoeckle\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomasstoeckle</url> Thomas Stoeckle[21]is an independent business consultant and researcher in the fields of traditional and social media, and public opinion, with a particular interest in psychology and behavioural insightsUntil November 2017, Thomas led strategic business development at LexisNexis Business Insight Solutions (BIS).

New research on its complex advertising model and a high-profile controversy involving the threat of demonetizing a popular conservative website in the United States have put the company on the defensive. This newest episode of \"Big Tech behaving badly\" may presage forthcoming legal and policy changes to how we treat global technology giants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's start with the controversy involving the Federalist, a right-wing online magazine with a populist streak. The website's articles tend to be provocative and controversial. It's certainly not for everyone. But in the polarized extremes of internet commentary, its content is relatively conventional. Think Fox News rather than InfoWars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet last week, the Federalist drew attention from Google for user-generated comments on its site that the online giant characterized( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293285/google-ads-bans-the-federalist-zero-hedge-racist-content-discrimination-demonetization\">https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293285/google-ads-bans-the-federalist-zero-hedge-racist-content-discrimination-demonetization</url> ) as \"derogatory.\" Google told the web-based magazine to remove the content(       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1272997425821540352\">https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1272997425821540352</url> ) or face the prospect of being prevented from receiving revenues from its online ads.</p><p>Although we don't know the particular comments in question, it's not necessarily indefensible that Google intervened, at least in principle. The role of technology platforms in monitoring and policing online content is the subject of an evolving and legitimate public debate.

The company has a dubious record of automatically deleting(       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/27/youtube-china-communisty-party-comments.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/27/youtube-china-communisty-party-comments.html</url> ) user comments that are critical of the Chinese Communist party on one hand, and overlooking conspiracy theories(       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html</url> ), misogyny, racism and other forms of extremism on the other. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has emerged as the leading conservative critic of Big Tech, has called Google's duplicity on these issues \"profoundly disingenuous.\"</p><p>It seems the United States Department of Justice agrees. It recently released a 25-page proposal( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download\">https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download</url> ) that would curb protections that technology platforms have had since 1996 for content posted on their sites by third parties. These protections - afforded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - also give technology companies the freedom to remove \"objectionable\" content at their discretion.</p><p>Sen. Hawley is not only calling for them( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-announces-bill-empowering-americans-sue-big-tech-companies-acting-bad-faith\">https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-announces-bill-empowering-americans-sue-big-tech-companies-acting-bad-faith</url> ) to be held liable for hosting content that they know is against the law, he's also seeking to limit the arbitrary removal of objectionable yet legal content, including by permitting users to sue. It's still too early to know whether there's sufficient support in Congress to amend Section 230, but one gets the sense that the political ground is shifting.</p><p>Yet this isn't Google's only political challenge on the horizon. A new academic paper( <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3500919\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3500919</url> ) (which is forthcoming in the Stanford Technology Law Review) also raises serious concerns about the company's advertising business model.</p><p>The paper provides a highly technical analysis of Google's behaviour in \"advertising exchanges,\" where advertising space is bought and sold electronically through centralized trading venues at high speeds using advanced algorithms. Think about your own online experience. When you go to a website and load a page, in the milliseconds that it takes for the page to load, there are real-time auctions( <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/economy/digital-advertising-markets-really-work/\">https://prospect.org/economy/digital-advertising-markets-really-work/</url> ) running in the background that determine which ads to load based on your personal data. More than 85 percent of online display advertising space (such as banner ads) in the United States are now traded this way.</p><p>The main issue that the author, Dina Srinivasan, an anti-trust expert affiliated with Yale University, identifies is Google's multifaceted role in digital advertising markets. The company's position as the leading trading venue, the leading intermediary between buyers and sellers and the largest seller of advertising space globally grants it unique abilities to steer buys and sell advertising to its own websites. It's notable, for instance, that the evidence shows that Google's intermediary services are overwhelmingly pushing advertising dollars to Google's properties such as Google Search and Gmail.</p><p>Google's three-sided role in digital advertising markets would be like if the Toronto Stock Exchange also owned the largest electronic trading platform and was itself one of the largest market participants selling its own wares. It's no surprise therefore that the company has been able to amass a major share of( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232433/digital-advertising-facebook-google-growth-tv-print-emarketer-2019\">https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232433/digital-advertising-facebook-google-growth-tv-print-emarketer-2019</url> ) the digital advertising market and squeeze out competitors, including news publishers.</p><p>What's interesting though is that Srinivasan argues that Google's practices (including superior information sharing between its exchange and its intermediary services) would be prohibited in other electronic trading markets, such as in equities and on stock exchanges. She thinks the solution lies in treating digital advertising exchanges similar to how we regulate real-time trading in the securities market. In particular, she proposes policy reforms to improve transparency, minimize conflicts of interest and enable greater competition in the world of digital advertising.</p><p>It's becoming increasingly clear that policymakers need to think critically about the place of large technology firms in our societies and the role for public policy to better regulate their activities and practices in the public interest. These are complicated and technical questions for which there are no simple answers. But the case of the Federalist and Srinivasan's new research reinforce that we can no longer avoid asking them.</p><p>National Post</p><p>Sean Speer: Google and Facebook should compensate news outlets.

New research on its complex advertising model and a high-profile controversy involving the threat of demonetizing a popular conservative website in the United States have put the company on the defensive. This newest episode of \"Big Tech behaving badly\" may presage forthcoming legal and policy changes to how we treat global technology giants.</p><p>Let's start with the controversy involving the Federalist, a right-wing online magazine with a populist streak. The website's articles tend to be provocative and controversial. It's certainly not for everyone. But in the polarized extremes of internet commentary, its content is relatively conventional. Think Fox News rather than InfoWars.</p><p>Yet last week, the Federalist drew attention from Google for user-generated comments on its site that the online giant characterized( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293285/google-ads-bans-the-federalist-zero-hedge-racist-content-discrimination-demonetization\">https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293285/google-ads-bans-the-federalist-zero-hedge-racist-content-discrimination-demonetization</url> ) as \"derogatory.\" Google told the web-based magazine to remove the content(       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1272997425821540352\">https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1272997425821540352</url> ) or face the prospect of being prevented from receiving revenues from its online ads.</p><p>Although we don't know the particular comments in question, it's not necessarily indefensible that Google intervened, at least in principle. The role of technology platforms in monitoring and policing online content is the subject of an evolving and legitimate public debate. Some experts have rightly observed( <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2020/06/17/justice-dept-gets-serious-about-rolling-back-big-tech-protections/\">https://nypost.com/2020/06/17/justice-dept-gets-serious-about-rolling-back-big-tech-protections/</url> ), for instance, that, as a private company, Google doesn't have to provide advertising services to anyone.</p><p>But the obvious double standard here is indefensible.

It recently released a 25-page proposal( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download\">https://www.justice.gov/file/1286331/download</url> ) that would curb protections that technology platforms have had since 1996 for content posted on their sites by third parties. These protections - afforded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - also give technology companies the freedom to remove \"objectionable\" content at their discretion.</p><p>Sen. Hawley is not only calling for them( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-announces-bill-empowering-americans-sue-big-tech-companies-acting-bad-faith\">https://www.hawley.senate.gov/senator-hawley-announces-bill-empowering-americans-sue-big-tech-companies-acting-bad-faith</url> ) to be held liable for hosting content that they know is against the law, he's also seeking to limit the arbitrary removal of objectionable yet legal content, including by permitting users to sue. It's still too early to know whether there's sufficient support in Congress to amend Section 230, but one gets the sense that the political ground is shifting.</p><p>Yet this isn't Google's only political challenge on the horizon. A new academic paper( <url normalizedValue=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3500919\">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3500919</url> ) (which is forthcoming in the Stanford Technology Law Review) also raises serious concerns about the company's advertising business model.</p><p>The paper provides a highly technical analysis of Google's behaviour in \"advertising exchanges,\" where advertising space is bought and sold electronically through centralized trading venues at high speeds using advanced algorithms. Think about your own online experience. When you go to a website and load a page, in the milliseconds that it takes for the page to load, there are real-time auctions( <url normalizedValue=\"https://prospect.org/economy/digital-advertising-markets-really-work/\">https://prospect.org/economy/digital-advertising-markets-really-work/</url> ) running in the background that determine which ads to load based on your personal data. More than 85 percent of online display advertising space (such as banner ads) in the United States are now traded this way.</p><p>The main issue that the author, Dina Srinivasan, an anti-trust expert affiliated with Yale University, identifies is Google's multifaceted role in digital advertising markets. The company's position as the leading trading venue, the leading intermediary between buyers and sellers and the largest seller of advertising space globally grants it unique abilities to steer buys and sell advertising to its own websites. It's notable, for instance, that the evidence shows that Google's intermediary services are overwhelmingly pushing advertising dollars to Google's properties such as Google Search and Gmail.</p><p>Google's three-sided role in digital advertising markets would be like if the Toronto Stock Exchange also owned the largest electronic trading platform and was itself one of the largest market participants selling its own wares. It's no surprise therefore that the company has been able to amass a major share of( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232433/digital-advertising-facebook-google-growth-tv-print-emarketer-2019\">https://www.vox.com/2019/2/20/18232433/digital-advertising-facebook-google-growth-tv-print-emarketer-2019</url> ) the digital advertising market and squeeze out competitors, including news publishers.</p><p>What's interesting though is that Srinivasan argues that Google's practices (including superior information sharing between its exchange and its intermediary services) would be prohibited in other electronic trading markets, such as in equities and on stock exchanges. She thinks the solution lies in treating digital advertising exchanges similar to how we regulate real-time trading in the securities market. In particular, she proposes policy reforms to improve transparency, minimize conflicts of interest and enable greater competition in the world of digital advertising.</p><p>It's becoming increasingly clear that policymakers need to think critically about the place of large technology firms in our societies and the role for public policy to better regulate their activities and practices in the public interest. These are complicated and technical questions for which there are no simple answers. But the case of the Federalist and Srinivasan's new research reinforce that we can no longer avoid asking them.</p><p>National Post</p><p>Sean Speer: Google and Facebook should compensate news outlets.

None.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Trump also claimed that <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>advertised President <person><nameText>Barack Obama's </nameText></person>State of the Union addresses on its home page but did not highlight his own. That, too, was false, as screenshots show that <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>did link to Mr. Trump's address this year. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But that concludes the ''defense of <person><nameText>Google</nameText></person>'' portion of this column. Because whether he knew it or not, Mr. Trump's false charges crashed into a longstanding set of worries about <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>its biases and its power. When you get beyond the president's claims, you come upon a set of uncomfortable facts -- uncomfortable for <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and for society, because they highlight how in thrall we are to this single company, and how few checks we have against the many unseen ways it is influencing global discourse.</p><p>  In particular, a raft of research suggests there is another kind of bias to worry about at <person><nameText>Google. </nameText></person>The naked partisan bias that Mr. Trump alleges is unlikely to occur, but there is a potential problem for hidden, pervasive and often unintended bias -- the sort that led <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>to once return links to many pornographic pages for searches for ''black girls,'' that offered ''angry'' and ''loud'' as autocomplete suggestions for the phrase ''why are black women so,'' or that returned pictures of black people for searches of ''gorilla.''</p><p>  I culled these examples -- which <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>has apologized for and fixed, but variants of which keep popping up -- from ''Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism,'' a book by Safiya U. Noble, a professor at the University of Southern California's Annenberg School of Communication.</p><p>  Dr. Noble argues that many people have the wrong idea about <person><nameText>Google. </nameText></person>We think of the search engine as a neutral oracle, as if the company somehow marshals computers and math to objectively sift truth from trash.</p><p>  But <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>is made by humans who have preferences, opinions and blind spots and who work within a corporate structure that has clear financial and political goals. What's more, because <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>systems are increasingly created by artificial intelligence tools that learn from real-world data, there's a growing possibility that it will amplify the many biases found in society, even unbeknown to its creators.</p><p>Google says it is aware of the potential for certain kinds of bias in its search results, and that it has instituted efforts to prevent them. ''What you have from us is an absolute commitment that we want to continually improve results and continually address these problems in an effective, scalable way,'' said Pandu Nayak, who heads <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>search ranking team. ''We have not sat around ignoring these problems.''</p><p>  For years, Dr. Noble and others who have researched hidden biases -- as well as the many corporate critics of <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>power, like the frequent antagonist Yelp -- have tried to start a public discussion about how the search company influences speech and commerce online.</p><p>  There's a worry now that Mr. Trump's incorrect charges could undermine such work. ''I think Trump's complaint undid a lot of good and sophisticated thought that was starting to work its way into public consciousness about these issues,'' said Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia who has studied <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>and Facebook's influence on society.</p><p>  Dr. Noble suggested a more constructive conversation was the one ''about one monopolistic platform controlling the information landscape.''</p><p>  So, let's have it.</p><p><person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>most important decisions are secret</p><p>  In the United States, about eight out of 10 web searches are conducted through <person><nameText>Google; </nameText></person>across Europe, South America and India, <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>share is even higher. <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>also owns other major communications platforms, among them YouTube and Gmail, and it makes the Android operating system and its app store. It is the world's dominant internet advertising company, and through that business, it also shapes the market for digital news.</p><p><person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>power alone is not damning. The important question is how it manages that power, and what checks we have on it. That's where critics say it falls down.</p><p><person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>influence on public discourse happens primarily through algorithms, chief among them the system that determines which results you see in its search engine. These algorithms are secret, which Google says is necessary because search is its golden goose (it does not want Microsoft's Bing to know what makes <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>so great) and because explaining the precise ways the algorithms work would leave them open to being manipulated.</p><p>  But this initial secrecy creates a troubling opacity. Because search engines take into account the time, place and some personalized factors when you search, the results you get today will not necessarily match the results I get tomorrow. This makes it difficult for outsiders to investigate bias across <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>results.</p><p>  A lot of people made fun this week of the paucity of evidence that Mr. Trump put forward to support his claim. But researchers point out that if <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>somehow went rogue and decided to throw an election to a favored candidate, it would only have to alter a small fraction of search results to do so. If the public did spot evidence of such an event, it would look thin and inconclusive, too.</p><p>  ''We really have to have a much more sophisticated sense of how to investigate and identify these claims,'' said Frank Pasquale, a professor at the University of Maryland's law school who has studied the role that algorithms play in society.</p><p>  In a law review article published in 2010, Mr. Pasquale outlined a way for regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission to gain access to search data to monitor and investigate claims of bias. No one has taken up that idea. Facebook, which also shapes global discourse through secret algorithms, recently sketched out a plan to give academic researchers access to its data to investigate bias, among other issues.</p><p><person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>has no similar program, but Dr. Nayak said the company often shares data with outside researchers. He also argued that <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>results are less ''personalized'' than people think, suggesting that search biases, when they come up, will be easy to spot.</p><p>  ''All our work is out there in the open -- anyone can evaluate it, including our critics,'' he said.</p><p>  Search biases mirror real-world ones</p><p>  The kind of blanket, intentional bias Mr. Trump is claiming would necessarily involve many workers at <person><nameText>Google. </nameText></person>And <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>is leaky; on hot-button issues -- debates over diversity or whether to work with the military -- politically minded employees have provided important information to the media. If there was even a rumor that <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>search team was skewing search for political ends, we would likely see some evidence of such a conspiracy in the media.</p><p>  That's why, in the view of researchers who study the issue of algorithmic bias, the more pressing concern is not about <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>deliberate bias against one or another major political party, but about the potential for bias against those who do not already hold power in society. These people -- women, minorities and others who lack economic, social and political clout -- fall into the blind spots of companies run by wealthy men in California.</p><p>  It's in these blind spots that we find the most problematic biases with <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>like in the way it once suggested a spelling correction for the search ''English major who taught herself calculus'' -- the correct spelling, <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>offered, was ''English major who taught himself calculus.''</p><p>  Why did it do that? <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>explanation was not at all comforting: The phrase ''taught himself calculus'' is a lot more popular online than ''taught herself calculus,'' so <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>computers assumed that it was correct. In other words, a longstanding structural bias in society was replicated on the web, which was reflected in <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>algorithm, which then hung out live online for who knows how long, unknown to anyone at <person><nameText>Google, </nameText></person>subtly undermining every female English major who wanted to teach herself calculus.</p><p>  Eventually, this error was fixed. But how many other such errors are hidden in <person><nameText>Google? </nameText></person>We have no idea.</p><p>Google says it understands these worries, and often addresses them. In 2016, some people noticed that it listed a Holocaust-denial site as a top result for the search ''Did the Holocaust happen?'' That started a large effort at the company to address hate speech and misinformation online. The effort, Dr. Nayak said, shows that ''when we see real-world biases making results worse than they should be, we try to get to the heart of the problem.''</p><p><person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>has escaped recent scrutiny</p><p>  Yet it is not just these unintended biases that we should be worried about. Researchers point to other issues: <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>algorithms favor recency and activity, which is why they are so often vulnerable to being manipulated in favor of misinformation and rumor in the aftermath of major news events. (Google says it is working on addressing misinformation.)</p><p>  Some of <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>rivals charge that the company favors its own properties in its search results over those of third-party sites -- for instance, how it highlights <person><nameText>Google's </nameText></person>local reviews instead of Yelp's in response to local search queries.</p><p>  Regulators in Europe have already fined <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>for this sort of search bias. In 2012, the F.T.C.'s antitrust investigators found credible evidence of unfair search practices at <person><nameText>Google. </nameText></person>The F.T.C.'s commissioners, however, voted unanimously against bringing charges. <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>denies any wrongdoing.</p><p>  The danger for <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>is that Mr. Trump's charges, however misinformed, create an opening to discuss these legitimate issues.</p><p>  On Thursday, Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, called for the F.T.C. to reopen its <person><nameText>Google </nameText></person>investigation.

The only long-shot chance for the bill is if lawmakers decide to come back for a special session, though there has been no talk of that. </p><p>  \"It's deeply disturbing that Google and tech lobbyists were quiet as a church mouse for the five years this bill has been percolating in Albany and then literally the morning it's up for vote, they bulldoze in with coercive demands on our lawmakers to change the language,\" Goldberg said. </p><p>  \"It's a disgrace how weak our lawmakers look for bowing down to these tech corporate overlords.\" </p><p>  The Internet Association - an influential lobbying group working on behalf of Google and a host of other Web sites used to disseminate revenge porn - fought the bill, which has passed the Assembly but needed Senate approval. </p><p>  Gov. Cuomo had pledged to sign the bill, had the proposal made it to his desk. </p><p>  The legislation's sponsor, Sen. Phil Boyle (R-LI) said he plans to continue to push for the bill's passage. But Boyle's pledge didn't placate Goldberg, who accused lawmakers of being in the pocket of \"Big Tech.\" </p><p>  \"There could be no better showing of what unfettered power big tech has on our government.

Any claims they make that big tech is aligned with victims of revenge porn are as hollow as Trump saying he's aligned with separated immigrant families,\" she said. </p><p>  \"Big Tech, especially Google, created the revenge porn problem. And now, just as we were about to enable victims to demand removal of their most intimate material from the internet via this law, Google renews its abuse.\" </p><p>  Before the bill failed, Boyle had said, \"There are laws against revenge porn in 40 other states, including California. If the New York Assembly truly wanted this legislation to pass, we can mirror a law like theirs.\" </p><p>  Internet Association Northeast Regional Director John Olsen said the group already works to remove bad actors from platforms it represents and \"will continue working with lawmakers who are committed to solving this problem.\" </p><p>  Attorney Daniel Szalkiewicz, who represents victims of revenge porn, said Google has to help if the disgusting practice is to ever be controlled. </p><p>  A rep for Google could not be reached for comment. </p><p>  Additional reporting by Julia Marsh, Max Jaeger and David K.

They are also highlighting original journalism because people want high quality information.\"</p><p>Hinds said Google is also responding to higher regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech, and this could be a pre-emptive strike to hold off potential repercussions from lawmakers down the road. Platforms such as Google and Facebook have been under the microscope from antitrust regulators and law makers for their role in disinformation, privacy, fake news and decimating local journalism.</p><p>\"I tend to be unimpressed by these token gestures,\" said Daniel Bernhard, executive director of Friends of Canadian Broadcasting. \"Ultimately, the responsibility lies with government. If we want to defend quality journalism we can't just wait for Google to help out. In this respect Canada has fallen far behind the rest of the world.\"</p><p>Bernhard argued that Google still shows different audiences different search results, while its subsidiary YouTube has been criticized for driving some viewers to extreme or fringe sources of information.</p><p>\"They refuse to submit to any standards of accountability for the quality of information they promote and they lobby hard against platform liability,\" says Bernhard.</p><p>Richard Gingras, vice-president of news for Google, wrote in a blog post that the platform's response to maintaining quality news is \"constantly evolving.\" The platform will use an army of 10,000 global \"raters\" to evaluate and improve algorithms.</p><p>One rating that may favour legacy media, looks at a publisher's overall reputation for original reporting, including whether they have won Pulitzer Prizes or other awards.</p><p>\"We hope these updates to elevate original reporting will provide people with a deeper understanding of their changing communities and the conversations going on around them. Giving everyone better access to original journalism,\" says Gingras.</p><p>Jeffrey Dvorkin, the director of the journalism program at the University of Toronto (Scarborough) campus, says in principle, Google's move to highlight original reporting is a good thing.</p><p>\"I sense that Google is trying very hard to move the discussion past regulation and over their diminished reputation, and I wish them well. This is not a bad step,\" says Dvorkin.</p><p>\"The platforms certainly need to do a better job of restoring trust.\"</p><p>However Dvorkin cautions that may mean the rush to publish first becomes even more paramount to publishers, which would entail risk and could lead to poorer quality journalism. The journalism professor pointed to a New York Times story about Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh that had to be corrected this week, causing major blowback.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019091955691416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X33-KWT1-JBTY-W010-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 19, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Larry Page, co-founder of Google, declined an invitation to account for Big Tech's inaction during the 2016 presidential election, when Russia spent millions on online advertising to sway voters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The snub was no isolated event. Mr Page, 46, has been an absentee landlord at Alphabet, Google's parent, for years. So it was little surprise that shareholders shrugged when Mr Page and Sergey Brin, 46, his fellow co-founder, </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-bosses-at-alphabet-stand-down-bjdnqljxt\">stepped down last week</url></p><p>.</p><p>Alphabet shares have risen nearly 5 per cent since then as investors bet that the $925 billion juggernaut would stay on its present course under Sundar Pichai. The executive will continue to run the Google division and takes charge of the Alphabet umbrella group, whose interests range from driverless cars to a speculative venture aiming to halt the ageing process.</p><p>Expect the status quo to survive as the founders switch to being non-executive directors. Mr Page and Mr Brin own 51 per cent of the voting shares, can hire and fire key executives and set Alphabet's strategic course. Mr Pichai, 47, won't be able to change direction without their say-so.</p><p>The founders may see little need to rock the boat. Since founding Google 21 years ago while studying for PhDs at Stanford University, the company has become the dominant internet search engine outside China, built YouTube into the world's largest streaming video platform and created a lucrative cloud computing business. Alphabet has more than $120 billion in cash and, in the third quarter alone, generated revenues of $40.5 billion and made after-tax profits of $7.1 billion.</p><p>Its cash cow is a digital advertising business that made $31 billion of operating profit in the first nine months of the year. Historically, Mr Page and Mr Brin diverted a portion of these profits into blue-sky projects. The question for investors is whether Mr Pichai will prove more successful an investor than his predecessors. Save cloud computing, the company has failed to create a business of scale outside its advertising bailiwick. Its \"moonshot\" ventures will bring in $600 million of revenues this year, but will swallow $4 billion of capital. Alphabet discloses little on these businesses and it's difficult to judge when, or if, any will pay off.</p><p>Of more immediate concern are the threats to the main source of Alphabet's wealth. With </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-bosses-at-alphabet-stand-down-bjdnqljxt\">Facebook</url></p><p>, Google forms a duopoly in digital advertising, but regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have vowed to sap their powers. They have accused the pair of failing to stem the spread of disinformation and of trampling over users' privacy. The European Union has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for breaking competition law. If European and American investigations force Google to limit how it gathers data, the financial damage would be greater still.</p><p>While Google battles more stringent regulation, competitors bite at its heels. Younger social networks such as Pinterest, a scrapbooking site, and Tiktok, a video-sharing app, are grabbing market share. Amazon casts an even more menacing shadow. More than half of US consumers go directly to the online shopping group when they search for a product. On this captive audience, Amazon is building a digital advertising business of genuine scale.</p><p>Over the past five years Alphabet shares have more than doubled. With rivals and regulators sharpening their knives, the rally will run out of steam.</p><p>                   ADVICE                   </p><p> Avoid</p><p>                   WHY                    </p><p>New competitors like Tiktok are growing their digital advertising revenues. And politicians have vowed to reduce Google's market power</p><p>                   Water Companies                   </p><p>The plans of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, not merely to </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/top-bosses-at-alphabet-stand-down-bjdnqljxt\">nationalise the water industry</url></p><p> but to begin doing so within the first 100 days of a Labour government, yesterday became a commentary on the likelihood of the main opposition party being voted into power (Robert Lea writes).</p><p>Only three of the ten large regional water monopolies remain in publicly traded form on the stock market: United Utilities, formerly known as North West Water; Severn Trent, which supplies across the Midlands to Gloucestershire; and Pennon, whose South West Water subsidiary covers the West Country.</p><p>Yesterday United Utilities shares rose 7p to close at a two-year high of 870p; Severn Trent's stock was up 31p at \u00a322.80, not far from a two-and-a-half-year high; and shares in Pennon ended the session 2p to the good at 934\u00bcp, not far short of overhauling the stock's all-time high of 945p.</p><p>The City is plainly discounting any chance of Mr McDonnell reversing the privatisations of the Thatcher years and bringing the water industry back into public ownership. Investors are choosing, instead, to believe the opinion polls that put the Conservatives with a strong working majority of about 345 of the 650 Westminster seats.</p><p>More to the point, even if the Tory majority fails to materialise, the number of Labour seats would likely be so short that any attempt to cobble together a minority government would come with the price of Jeremy Corbyn's head and policies like water nationalisation.</p><p>The three listed water companies have also risen on the back of next week's scheduled five year price-capping determination by Ofwat. All three have been passed by the regulator already and should escape the worst of the expected cuts.</p><p>This has left the trio trading on historically high price-earnings multiples of about 16.</p><p>While corporate action could be on the horizon - takeover funds will be running the numbers and Pennon is to demerge its Viridor waste business - this is a sector caught in the eye of the climate change storm and future investments will need to be of the eye-watering scale.</p><p>                   ADVICE                   </p><p> Hold</p><p>                   WHY                    </p><p>They have likely escaped nationalisation but are fully priced</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-58537704</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPH-XGD1-JCJY-G367-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1008\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Larry Page, co-founder of Google, declined an invitation to account for Big Tech's inaction during the 2016 presidential election, when Russia spent millions on online advertising to sway voters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The snub was no isolated event. Mr Page, 46, has been an absentee landlord at Alphabet, Google's parent, for years. So it was little surprise that shareholders shrugged when Mr Page and Sergey Brin, 46, his fellow co-founder, stepped down last week. Alphabet shares have risen nearly 5 per cent since then as investors bet that the $925 billion juggernaut would stay on its present course under Sundar Pichai. The executive will continue to run the Google division and takes charge of the Alphabet umbrella group, whose interests range from driverless cars to a speculative venture aiming to halt the ageing process.</p><p>Expect the status quo to survive as the founders switch to being nonexecutive directors. Mr Page and Mr Brin own 51 per cent of the voting shares, can hire and fire key executives and set Alphabet's strategic course. Mr Pichai, 47, won't be able to change direction without their say-so.</p><p>The founders may see little need to rock the boat. Since founding Google 21 years ago while studying for PhDs at Stanford University, the company has become the dominant internet search engine outside China, built YouTube into the world's largest streaming video platform and created a lucrative cloud computing business. Alphabet has more than $120 billion in cash and, in the third quarter alone, generated revenues of $40.5 billion and made after-tax profits of $7.1 billion.</p><p>Its cash cow is a digital advertising business that made $31 billion of operating profit in the first nine months of the year. Historically, Mr Page and Mr Brin diverted a portion of these profits into blue-sky projects. The question for investors is whether Mr Pichai will prove more successful an investor than his predecessors. Save cloud computing, the company has failed to create a business of scale outside its advertising bailiwick. Its \"moonshot\" ventures will bring in $600 million of revenues this year, but will swallow $4 billion of capital. Alphabet discloses little on these businesses and it's difficult to judge when, or if, any will pay off.</p><p>Of more immediate concern are the threats to the main source of Alphabet's wealth. With Facebook, Google forms a duopoly in digital advertising, but regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have vowed to sap their powers. They have accused the pair of failing to stem the spread of disinformation and of trampling over users' privacy. The European Union has fined Google more than (EURO)8 billion for breaking competition law. If European and American investigations force Google to limit how it gathers data, the financial damage would be greater still.</p><p>While Google battles more stringent regulation, competitors bite at its heels. Younger social networks such as Pinterest, a scrapbooking site, and Tiktok, a video-sharing app, are grabbing market share. Amazon casts an even more menacing shadow. More than half of US consumers go directly to the online shopping group when they search for a product. On this captive audience, Amazon is building a digital advertising business of genuine scale.</p><p>Over the past five years Alphabet shares have more than doubled. With rivals and regulators sharpening their knives, the rally will run out of steam.</p><p>ADVICE Avoid WHY New competitors like Tiktok are growing their digital advertising revenues. And politicians have vowed to reduce Google's market power</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-155540157</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XPJ-PR11-JCBW-N3Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Larry Page, co-founder of Google, declined an invitation to account for Big Tech's inaction during the 2016 presidential election, when Russia spent millions on online advertising to sway voters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The snub was no isolated event. Mr Page, 46, has been an absentee landlord at Alphabet, Google's parent, for years. So it was little surprise that shareholders shrugged when Mr Page and Sergey Brin, 46, his fellow co-founder, stepped down last week. Alphabet shares have risen nearly 5 per cent since then as investors bet that the $925 billion juggernaut would stay on its present course under Sundar Pichai. The executive will continue to run the Google division and takes charge of the Alphabet umbrella group, whose interests range from driverless cars to a speculative venture aiming to halt the ageing process.</p><p>Expect the status quo to survive as the founders switch to being nonexecutive directors. Mr Page and Mr Brin own 51 per cent of the voting shares, can hire and fire key executives and set Alphabet's strategic course. Mr Pichai, 47, won't be able to change direction without their say-so.</p><p>The founders may see little need to rock the boat. Since founding Google 21 years ago while studying for PhDs at Stanford University, the company has become the dominant internet search engine outside China, built YouTube into the world's largest streaming video platform and created a lucrative cloud computing business. Alphabet has more than $120 billion in cash and, in the third quarter alone, generated revenues of $40.5 billion and made after-tax profits of $7.1 billion.</p><p>Its cash cow is a digital advertising business that made $31 billion of operating profit in the first nine months of the year. Historically, Mr Page and Mr Brin diverted a portion of these profits into blue-sky projects. The question for investors is whether Mr Pichai will prove more successful an investor than his predecessors. Save cloud computing, the company has failed to create a business of scale outside its advertising bailiwick. Its \"moonshot\" ventures will bring in $600 million of revenues this year, but will swallow $4 billion of capital. Alphabet discloses little on these businesses and it's difficult to judge when, or if, any will pay off.</p><p>Of more immediate concern are the threats to the main source of Alphabet's wealth. With Facebook, Google forms a duopoly in digital advertising, but regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have vowed to sap their powers.

Maybe they'll Vivisimo, Eurekster or Grokker.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though none has quite the ring of Google as the trendy verb it has become, they too are Internet search engines with promising technology. And someday, one could stake a claim as the No. 1 search destination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"One of the things that spurred these companies on is the success Google had,\" said Gary Price, news editor at Search Engine Watch, an industry newsletter. \"What Google does so well, and maybe better than any company I've ever seen, is that they're brilliant at marketing. They're incredible at building a brand.\"</p><p>Google grabbed attention because its searches got better results than with other engines. Over the past five years since it dropped the \"beta\" test label from the site in September 1999, the company has added features, built a legion of followers and become the hot tech company, even during the dot-com meltdown.</p><p>Now Google is in the spotlight again as it prepares for its initial public stock offering. It's getting attention not only because it's one of the first big tech offerings in recent years, but also because of the unusual auction process it has set up for the stock sale.</p><p>But the company's well-polished image hasn't prevented problems with the IPO. The auction, expected to start this week, apparently is going to be delayed, according to various news reports, because of problems preparing institutional investors for the sale and an investigation by California security regulators over unregistered shares Google issued.</p><p>In addition, the prolonged hype, a target range of $108 to $135 a share and the intricacies of the bidding process have cooled some of the interest.</p><p>Some mutual funds and hedge funds told the Wall Street Journal that they might skip the auction and see what happens to the price later. Even individual investors seem to be backing off.</p><p>\"There's just been a lot of roadblocks for the average investor to participate,\" said Matthew Crowder, who runs the Google IPO Central Web site, which is not affiliated with Google. \"A lot of them gave up on the whole process.\"</p><p>Crowder, 29, of Albuquerque, N.M., saw visits to his site drop from 70,000 in the spring to about 45,000 in July. The site features news stories about the IPO, as well as message boards. But posters have gone from a sense of anticipation to more skepticism.</p><p>Of course, it's a far different stock market from when Google first burst on the scene in 1999. The Dow closed at 10,707.70 on Aug. 9, 1999, on its way to a record high of 11,722.98 in January 2000. The Nasdaq Composite Index was at 2,518.98 before peaking at 5,048.62 in March 2000. The Dow closed Friday at 9,815.62; and Nasdaq, at 1,776.89.</p><p>It's also a different world in search engines. Five years ago, sites such as Alta Vista and Lycos were among the heavy hitters. Today, they've fallen from their lofty perch, pushed aside by Google. Indeed, Lycos Inc. is being sold for $95-million just four years after it had been purchased for $12.5-billion.</p><p>\"One of the things with search, it's still so young and still volatile,\" said Chris Winfield, a member of the Search Engine Marketing Professionals Organization and president of 10e20, a search engine marketing company in New York. \"There could be a new company (dominating) tomorrow.\"</p><p>Some things are the same. Users still get thousands or millions of hits on searches, many of them not relevant. So with Internet search far from a perfect science, the quest continues for technology that will give people more of the information they want, and increase visitors and advertising dollars to the winners.</p><p>And the money to be made on search is substantial. Google reported earnings of $79.1-million on revenue of $700.2-million in the second quarter. So Google competitors, both big and small, are not sitting still.</p><p>Microsoft is investing a reported $100-million to beef up its search engine, and Yahoo has added new features and services, including Yahoo Local last week that takes search from a worldwide exercise to a neighborhood.</p><p>And Yahoo is one to watch, Winfield said. \"In my eyes, they have the most important things in search: personalization and localization,\" he said. \"It's why I've been asserting that Yahoo has a big advantage over Google.\"</p><p>Personalization means the search engine remembers your patterns and interests. For example, Amazon.com suggests items you might be interested in based on previous visits.</p><p>It also can mean setting preferences to narrow searches. At Yahoo's SmartShop, people can determine what they're looking for in items. For MP3 players, users can move sliding bars to determine price, song capacity, brand and size, then see the results.</p><p>Eurekster remembers the sites you like, but adds a community element by letting friends \"share\" results of common searches.</p><p>Localization means narrowing the focus to a neighborhood level. Google Local came out before Yahoo's, but Yahoo is getting more buzz. Both let users do a keyword search with an additional box for an address, city or ZIP code. In addition, online Yellow Pages companies have been enhancing the presence of small businesses.</p><p>So if you're looking for charter fishing in Clearwater, you'll get a list of local boats at Yahoo and Google. Dan Hood, owner of Daisy Mae Fishing Co. in Clearwater, advertises on Google but likes the way Yahoo results are displayed.</p><p>Hood began his Web site in 1998 and says it accounts for about 30 percent of his business. It comes up on Yahoo searches because he has studied how to keep up its profile for engines. But it's hit or miss on Google.</p><p>\"Google is much more difficult for a Web site to come up on regular rankings,\" Hood said. \"You're almost forced to advertise.\"</p><p>Good placement is critical, Hood says, because most people won't go more than two or three pages deep into the results.</p><p>Industry watcher Winfield doesn't expect to see personalization and localization refined for another 18 months or so, but they're not the only emerging trends in search.</p><p>Vivisimo \"clusters\" results. So if you search for Florida, it displays a list of topics such as Government, University, Vacation and Hotels in a column so the user can go directly to the subject of interest.</p><p>Vivisimo also has a preview feature that allows people to look at a site while still on the search page. That avoids going back and forth between various Web sites and the search results.</p><p>SpeechBot scans audio and video by keyword, taking search beyond just text. Grokker \"maps\" results in a visual display of spheres that list categories. Ask Jeeves has tweaked its service, so if you ask a question, it will not only provide links, but also give an answer. It also will provide a local service starting next month.</p><p>In addition, there has been an explosion of search engines for specialty topics, Price of Search Engine Watch says, and more access to free databases, such as the Librarians' Index to the Internet. \"The challenge is that people just need to know that they're out there,\" he said.</p><p>Google isn't sitting by idly, as witnessed by the rush of interest for its Gmail e-mail service this year. It will keep trying new services, and it will keep up its marketing.</p><p>\"How Google changes when it becomes a public company, if they change, is something we'll be watching very closely,\" said Price, noting that it will have more people, from stockholders to advertisers, to keep happy. \"Trying to be all things to all people is often a challenge.\"<br/>\u00a0<br/>Information from Times wires was used in this report.

An optometrist has an office downstairs.</p><p>Weinberg's company, DuckDuckGo, has become one of the feistiest adversaries of Google. Started over a decade ago, DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-focused alternative to Google's search engine.</p><p>The company's share of the search engine market is still tiny - about 1% compared with Google's 85%, according to StatCounter. But it has tripled over the past two years and is now handling around 40 million searches a day. It has also made a profit in each of the last five years, Weinberg said.</p><p>Weinberg, 40, is among the most outspoken critics of the internet giants. DuckDuckGo's chief executive has repeatedly called for new privacy-focused legislation and has warned at hearings and in newspaper opinion pieces about the problems that big companies can cause by tracking our every move online.</p><p>But the challenges faced by DuckDuckGo reflect just how difficult it is to take on the giants and build an internet business that is focused on the privacy of its users.</p><p>After a decade, the private company's modest success is an indication that, even as regulators around the world consider tougher rules for the data-tracking methods of big tech companies, selling consumers on privacy-focused services is still an uphill battle.</p><p>Like other search companies, DuckDuckGo displays ads at the top of each search page. But unlike others, it does not track the online behavior of its users to personalize the ads.</p><p>DuckDuckGo constantly bumps into Google's business, which stretches far beyond search. It also has to contend with the fact that most people don't seem willing to give up much to recover their privacy, and are easily overwhelmed when they decide to try to make a change.</p><p>\"It's not as easy to switch as we'd like it to be,\" Weinberg said while sitting in his office in jeans, red sneakers and a black short-sleeve shirt. \"There is a lot of inertia drawing people back to the existing system.\"</p><p>These limitations are reflected in DuckDuckGo's modest offices. DuckDuckGo, which has 65 employees, has done only two relatively small fundraising rounds, about $13 million, that add up to less than what Google makes in an hour. Weinberg parks his 2011 Honda minivan in a parking lot you can see from his corner office, which is papered mostly in drawings by his two sons.</p><p>For people who care about privacy, DuckDuckGo is a reminder that it is possible to offer internet access and build an online business without logging every move made by users. It also provides a vision of what the internet might look like if companies are forced to scale back the surveillance economy.</p><p>\"DuckDuckGo is very much a poster child for a future in which companies stand with their users and still make money,\" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on privacy and online rights. \"They counter the assumption that we've all been socialized to accept: that it is normal to hand over all your information. DuckDuckGo shows that doesn't have to be the way.\"</p><p>Google has so far avoided any showdowns with DuckDuckGo. Last year, Google added DuckDuckGo as one of the four default search engines available for users of its internet browser, Chrome.</p><p>But the internet giant has not taken kindly to DuckDuckGo's suggestions that it is selling information about its users to the highest bidder.</p><p>\"The data we collect makes our product more helpful for people in a variety of ways, such as improving our understanding of queries and combating threats like spam and fraud,\" said Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman. \"We keep this data private and secure, and we provide controls so people can make their own choices.\"</p><p>Weinberg started DuckDuckGo in 2008 when he was a stay-at-home dad, after struggling to get two previous startups off the ground. The early versions of DuckDuckGo (its name is a nod to the children's game) did not have any focus on privacy. When he went in that direction, it was attractive to only a small number of privacy advocates.</p><p>But after Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, revealed extensive online surveillance by the U.S. government in 2013, privacy became a selling point. Business began to grow.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is not the only upstart that is trying to capitalize on privacy concerns. Proton Technologies, a Swiss startup, is taking on Gmail with an alternative email service. The Firefox and Brave browsers are more focused on privacy than Chrome. And Google Maps users can switch to OpenStreetMap.</p><p>DuckDuckGo's search site looks similar to Google, with the G replaced by a playful cartoon head of a duck, who goes by the name Dax. Type in a question and up pops a list of links that looks like what you'd get from Google, with definitions from Wikipedia at the top and maps supplied through a partnership with Apple Maps.</p><p>Weinberg said the site was designed to make it feel similar to Google, to ease the transition for new users. While DuckDuckGo does not keep data on its users, it can pull the geographic location from each query and serve local results for things like restaurants and news.</p><p>\"We don't think privacy is stopping getting good search results for anybody,\" Weinberg said.</p><p>In online reviews at sites like Reddit and Quora, users praising DuckDuckGo's little features - like shortcuts for searching specific websites, known as bangs - are roughly equal in number to those who find its search results inferior.</p><p>I made DuckDuckGo my default search engine while I was doing my reporting for this article. I mostly didn't notice a difference, though I did find the maps and local results to be less on target. And there were times when DuckDuckGo couldn't figure out what I was looking for when Google could, especially for more obscure queries.</p><p>Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written extensively about privacy, said that whenever he had tried DuckDuckGo, he had given up after a few days because of nagging doubts about quality of the results.</p><p>\"I'm almost embarrassed to say that I don't use it more than I do,\" Turow said. \"There is something in my head that tells me I'll get a better search from Google, even when I don't know if that is demonstrably correct or not.\"</p><p>DuckDuckGo is also up against another hard reality of the online world: If you call up DuckDuckGo on the Chrome browser, for example, Google is still logging your search queries.</p><p>\"It can feel a bit futile as an individual,\" said Liz Coll, the head of digital change at Consumers International, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's quite hard to isolate your search engine as opposed to all the other things you do online.\"</p><p>DuckDuckGo is expanding beyond the search engine. The company's second most popular product, a free widget that can be installed in any browser, blocks invisible trackers from Google and other companies while providing a privacy and security grade for every website.</p><p>The plug-in gives Google's main website a grade of D, because, DuckDuckGo says, Google tracks you across the web and keeps permanent logs of your activity, which either the government or hackers might exploit.</p><p>Google has said it offers users many settings so they can opt out of data collection. Most people don't, the company said, because the data collection makes online services better and hasn't led to big problems - at least at Google.</p><p>Weinberg said the challenge of parsing what Google did and did not do was an indication of why it was so important to build alternatives that don't keep any data.</p><p>\"All of these companies were saying you can't make money without tracking your users,\" he said. \"By us existing and getting bigger and being profitable, we serve as the existence proof that it is possible.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUFNEW-648621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUFNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKF-MMT1-DY37-D0MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8391</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1305\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Buffalo News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Buffalo News (New York)</publicationName><edition>Buffalo News Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QLV</classCode><className>OPTOMETRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009SQW</classCode><className>PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEZQ</classCode><className>WEB ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DKTF</classCode><className>SURVEILLANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QLV</classCode><className>OPTOMETRY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEZQ</classCode><className>WEB ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CYGN</classCode><className>PARKING SPACES &amp; FACILITIES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RURCMEVGMTYyNjAzNDFDM0E0QzBEMjJCNTgxMTc5MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUQzM0QzNzNGREY4NDcxOEIyRTk4NTM1OTcwMzcwMUY</classCode><className>Parking Facilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Residents welcome the growth but are wary of its hazards after a crane collapse left four dead.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SEATTLE \u2014 For Seattle, a tech boomtown anxious about how fast it is growing, one distinction has been bittersweet: More giant construction cranes crowding its skyline than in any other city in the country, for three years running. The cranes symbolize a building frenzy driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs that most cities would envy \u2014 but one that has also brought worsening traffic jams, soaring housing costs and tear-down threats to popular landmarks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cranes themselves turned menacing on Saturday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/us/seattle-crane-collapse.html\">when pieces of one came crashing down</url> from atop a building being built for Google, killing two ironworkers who were involved with taking the crane apart and two passers-by on the busy street below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents said on Sunday that they were withholding judgment until more is known about the cause of the accident, which happened on a day with erratic weather. But they are resigned to the reality that Seattle will be one giant construction site for the foreseeable future.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the city of cranes,\u201d said Daniel Kahane, a violin teacher who lives on a boat on Lake Union, near the accident site. \u201cThey are a necessity if we want to grow this city. I walk under them, but I do have my eyes to the sky.\u201d</p><p>The latest building craze was touched off largely by Amazon, which decided in 2007 to locate its headquarters in the South Lake Union district just north of downtown. Other big tech companies followed, and so many streets now have blocked lanes or closed sidewalks to accommodate construction that navigating parts of the core business district can feel like a game of Frogger.</p><p>Tiara Jewell and her family used to live in South Lake Union, where she could count 16 cranes from her apartment window. But they moved after two buildings on either side of theirs were torn down to make way for large new ones. \u201cI was concerned about having to walk under the construction site, and with all the debris,\u201d Ms. Jewell said.</p><p>She used to take precautions like crossing the street to stay away from building sites, she said, but \u201cit has become so ubiquitous, you can\u2019t avoid it.\u201d But now, she said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t take anything for granted.\u201d</p><p>Ms. Jewell said she was a block away from the accident site a few hours before the crane fell down on Saturday, taking her son for vaccinations and then a doughnut afterward as a reward. When she heard about the accident, she was shaken.</p><p>\u201cIf everything is moving so fast, are we actually taking the time to make sure things are safe?\u201d she said.</p><p>By Sunday morning, crews had cleared the crushed cars and crane debris from Mercer Street, a major thoroughfare that passes the accident site and connects to Interstate 5. Much of the equipment used for the cleanup was gone by late afternoon. Officials said Mercer Street may be reopened for the Monday evening commute.</p><p>And overhead, construction crews were once again taking apart the stricken crane, lowering sections that flatbed trucks hauled away to a storage lot.</p><p>King County officials have not released the names of the four people killed, but on Sunday, Seattle Pacific University, a Christian college a few miles north of downtown, said that one of them was Sarah Wong, a freshman who intended to major in nursing. She was in a car driving down Mercer Street that was struck by part of the falling crane.</p><p>\u201cWhile we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of our precious student, we draw comfort from each other, our strong community of faith, and God\u2019s presence with us in times of sorrow,\u201d the school said in a statement.</p><p>The Washington Department of Labor and Industries is responsible for investigating the accident. Tim Church, a spokesman for the department, said that when he reached the scene late Saturday, \u201cit looked like something had exploded.\u201d Machinery was strewn across the street, he said, and the roofs of cars had been ripped open by rescue workers to free people inside.</p><p>Mr. Church said four companies would be involved in the investigation: GLY Construction, the general contractor on the building; Morrow Equipment, which owned the crane; Northwest TowerCrane Service, which was disassembling it; and Omega Rigging and Machinery Moving, whose mobile crane was being used to lower detached sections. \u201cYou can see there are a lot of people involved, and it was very complex,\u201d he said.</p><p>GLY said in a statement that it was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the accident, and that it and its relevant subcontractors are \u201ccooperating fully with investigators and assisting the local authorities.\u201d</p><p>The state tightened the regulation of cranes after one collapsed in Bellevue in 2006, killing a Microsoft lawyer in his apartment. The state got more resources for overseeing cranes after that, but \u201cwith 120 tower cranes and seven investigators, you can tell they are very busy all the time,\u201d Mr. Church said.</p><p>It may be a while before the cause of Saturday\u2019s accident is determined. The 2006 investigation, which took roughly six months, ultimately <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/blame-for-crane-collapse-affirmed/\">cited faulty design of the crane\u2019s base</url>.</p><p>For years, much of South Lake Union was a hodgepodge of warehouses, car repair shops and light industry. Paul Allen, a co-founder of Microsoft, bought a lot of the land in the district and hoped to turn it into Seattle\u2019s version of Central Park, but the public voted down the plans. Mr. Allen\u2019s real estate company, Vulcan, then had ideas about developing it as a medical research center, before Amazon agreed to use much of the land for its headquarters campus.</p><p>Drawn by the engineering and technical talent that Amazon and Microsoft built up in the region, more than a dozen other major tech companies have built major outposts in Seattle, including Facebook and Uber.</p><p>Google\u2019s Seattle headquarters was being developed by Vulcan on a prominent spot, the last available development site just south of Lake Union. People who regularly pass through the area had seen indications recently that the building was nearly finished and that Google would soon be moving in.</p><p>Alex Watson, who operates a streetcar that passes by the building, said he saw last week that workers had hung a large, brightly colored logo for Google\u2019s cloud division on the facade.</p><p>Mr. Watson said he had once trained to be a crane operator, so he was interested in cranes and had hoped on Saturday morning to catch glimpses of the big one on the Google building being dismantled. The horizontal boom was already down, he said, but by the time he had to move on, the vertical tower was still standing.</p><p>Shaking his head on Sunday at the scale of the accident, he said, \u201cImagine a semi-truck fell down off a 10-story building onto the street.\u201d</p><p>But the city has to keep building just the same, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s life, it\u2019s what we need.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Four people were killed when part of a construction crane crashed down from atop a building in Seattle on Saturday. The crane was being dismantled at the time of the accident.

The cranes symbolize a building frenzy driven by an influx of high-paying tech jobs that most cities would envy -- but one that has also brought worsening traffic jams, soaring housing costs and tear-down threats to popular landmarks.</p><p>The cranes themselves turned menacing Saturday, when pieces of  one came crashing down from atop a building being built for Google,  killing two ironworkers who were involved with taking the crane  apart and two passers-by on the busy street below.</p><p> Residents said Sunday that they were withholding judgment until  more is known about the cause of the accident, which happened on a  day with erratic weather. But they are resigned to the reality that  Seattle will be one giant construction site for the foreseeable  future.</p><p> \"It's the city of cranes,\" said Daniel Kahane, a violin teacher  who lives on a boat on Lake Union, near the accident site. \"They  are a necessity if we want to grow this city. I walk under them,  but I do have my eyes to the sky.\"</p><p> The latest building craze was touched off largely by Amazon,  which decided in 2007 to locate its headquarters in the South Lake  Union district just north of downtown. Other big tech companies  followed, and so many streets now have blocked lanes or closed  sidewalks to accommodate construction that navigating parts of the  core business district can feel like a game of Frogger.</p><p> Tiara Jewell and her family used to live in South Lake Union,  where she could count 16 cranes from her apartment window. But they  moved after two buildings on either side of theirs were torn down  to make way for large new ones. \"I was concerned about having to  walk under the construction site, and with all the debris,\" Jewell  said.</p><p> She used to take precautions like crossing the street to stay  away from building sites, she said, but \"it has become so  ubiquitous, you can't avoid it.\" But now, she said, \"I shouldn't  take anything for granted.\"</p><p> Jewell said she was a block away from the accident site a few  hours before the crane fell down Saturday, taking her son for  vaccinations and then a doughnut afterward as a reward. When she  heard about the accident, she was shaken.</p><p> \"If everything is moving so fast, are we actually taking the  time to make sure things are safe?\" she said.</p><p> By Sunday morning, crews had cleared the crushed cars and crane  debris from Mercer Street, a major thoroughfare that passes the  accident site and connects to Interstate 5. The equipment used for  the cleanup was largely gone by late afternoon, raising the  possibility that Mercer Street could be reopened for the Monday  morning commute.</p><p> And overhead, construction crews were once again taking apart  the stricken crane, lowering sections that flatbed trucks hauled  away to a storage lot.</p><p> King County officials have not released the names of the four  people killed, but on Sunday, Seattle Pacific University, a  Christian college a few miles north of downtown, said that one of  them was Sarah Wong, a freshman who intended to major in nursing.  She was in a car driving down Mercer Street that was struck by part  of the falling crane.</p><p> \"While we grieve the sudden and tragic loss of our precious  student, we draw comfort from each other, our strong community of  faith, and God's presence with us in times of sorrow,\" the school  said in a statement.</p><p> The Washington Department of Labor and Industries is  responsible for investigating the accident. Tim Church, a spokesman  for the department, said that when he reached the scene late  Saturday, \"it looked like something had exploded.\" Machinery was  strewn across the street, he said, and the roofs of cars had been  ripped open by rescue workers to free people inside.</p><p> Church said four companies would be involved in the  investigation: GLY Construction, the general contractor on the  building; Morrow Equipment, which owned the crane; Northwest TowerCrane Service, which was disassembling it; and Omega Rigging and  Machinery Moving, whose mobile crane was being used to lower  detached sections. \"You can see there are a lot of people involved,  and it was very complex,\" he said.</p><p> GLY said in a statement that it was \"heartbroken\" by the  accident, and that it and its relevant subcontractors are  \"cooperating fully with investigators and assisting the local  authorities.\"</p><p> The state tightened the regulation of cranes after one  collapsed in Bellevue in 2006, killing a Microsoft lawyer in his  apartment. The state got more resources for overseeing cranes after  that, but \"with 120 tower cranes and seven investigators, you can  tell they are very busy all the time,\" Church said.</p><p> It may be a while before the cause of Saturday's accident is  determined. The 2006 investigation, which took roughly six months,  ultimately cited faulty design of the crane's base.</p><p> For years, much of South Lake Union was a hodgepodge of  warehouses, car repair shops and light industry. Paul Allen, a  co-founder of Microsoft, bought a lot of the land in the district  and hoped to turn it into Seattle's version of Central Park, but  the public voted down the plans. Allen's real estate company,  Vulcan, then had ideas about developing it as a medical research  center, before Amazon agreed to use much of the land for its  headquarters campus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-DLYGAZ20190429Ar00300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYGAZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0M-PVB1-JBCN-43T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Next week, we're expecting a final decision on new city regulations on the likes of Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft. More details:</p><p><br/> \u2014Since late 2009, when the producers of the award-winning documentary Sonicsgate: Requiem for a Team raised $5,012 from 66 supporters online[5], Seattle-based projects of every description have collectively attracted pledges of more than $28 million from supporters via Kickstarter. Earlier this month, the leading crowd-funding platform touted its milestone of more than $1 billion pledged[6] since its April 2009 inception. Some 2,987 projects based in Seattle have been funded, including Planetary Resources, which sought support for a private space telescope to be used by individuals[7], and Robot Turtles, the board game from Dan Shapiro for teaching youngsters to think like programmers[8]. Sonicsgate[9] appears to be the first successful Seattle-based project. A version of the documentary will air nine times on ESPN Classic, beginning tonight.<br/> \u2014Seattle drug developer Kineta[10] is taking an undisclosed investment from a new 'physician-led' private equity firm called angelMD[11]. Kineta, which aims to turn profits faster by focusing on early-stage trials that can be licensed to bigger players for further development, is the first investment for the fund, which is based in Seattle and San Francisco. The company has taken funding from some unique sources, including an undisclosed investment last May from a group of oil traders[12]. Kineta had accumulated $46 million in total research and development support to that point. It says its development pipeline now includes five drugs, headlined by ShK-186, a compound in an early-stage trial for psoriatic arthritis.<br/> \u2014The Seattle City Council is set to vote Monday on driver caps for Lyft, Sidecar, and UberX, the so-called transportation network companies. I haven't delved into this issue, but luckily several other media outlets are doing a great job covering it. GeekWire, in particular, has offered comprehensive coverage[13] of this complex issue, right down to the glue on Uber's promotional posters[14]. Goldy, the erstwhile Stranger writer, also has a lengthy piece up at HorsesAss[15] this week arguing why TNCs, as they're currently operated, violate the city's municipal code.<br/> \u2014Lively[16], the Seattle-based company taking concert bootlegs to a whole new level, got some solid local and national ink going into South By Southwest this week, including a write-up in The New York Times[17]. SXSW, the big tech-music event in Austin, TX\u2014see a slideshow from our Xconomy Texas readers, curated by editor Angela Shah[18]\u2014looked to be a potentially break-out moment for Lively, and according to this great profile by The Seattle Times' Paul de Barros[19], the company was going all-in. It was courting the Mr. Bigs[20] of the major music labels and planning to record 120 concerts. Lively backer Rich Barton tells de Barros, 'This could be a defining event.'<br/> Comments[21] | Reprints[22] | Share: <url

I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight on a special edition of THE WILLIS REPORT, live from Washington, D.C., hey it's sorry but nothing is changing. That's the takeaway from Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the Obamacare website mess today. She's apologizing but not rolling back on deadlines. Americans will still have to pay fines if they don't play along with the White House's tune.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to weigh in, Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Form and Republican congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio who is at the hearing today. Doug, I'm going to start with you. We got an apology.</p><p/><p>DOUG HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM PRESIDENT: Yes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Obviously - were you satisfied with what you heard?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, I thought the secretary did a good job, quite frankly. She had the right demeanor. I thought the apology rang true. And she did her job in that she answered the question she wanted to answer and she didn't answer the ones that they did not want her to talk about.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: It was a lot that didn't get answered today. We will hit on some of that. But you know, this got testy testing many, many times. And Sebelius telling <person><nameText>Marsha Blackburn </nameText></person>the congresswoman to hold her accountable. Even that was testy. Listen to this.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. <person><nameText>MARSHA BLACKBURN </nameText></person>(R), TENNESSEE: Who is in charge, madam secretary?</p><p/><p><person><nameText>KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, </nameText></person>HHS SECRETARY: The person now in charge as an integrator is QSSI, one of our -</p><p/><p>BLACKBURN: Who was in charge?</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: -- was in charge -</p><p/><p>BLACKBURN: AT that team who is the individual -</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: Michele Snyder.</p><p/><p>BLACKBURN: Michele Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle.</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: Well, excuse me, congresswoman, Michele Snyder is not responsible for the debacle, hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.</p><p/><p>BLACKBURN: OK.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I'm responsible. You just heard that from the secretary of Health and Human Services.</p><p/><p>Congressman, if she's accountable, why does she still have the job?</p><p/><p>REP. BILL JOHNSON (R), OHIO: Well, that's a good question. You know, <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>serves at the pleasure of the president, as does the lady that she said was in charge. If that's the kind of performance that they are willing to tolerate, I can tell you my experience as a program manager, I would not have had a job if I had performed like this.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You know, I think in the private sector nobody understands what's going on. I tell you in New York we are all mystified. But here in Washington, different rules apply. Here is my big question. And my take away from the whole thing today. She seemed to be saying, \"We are sorry. We are sorry. We really didn't mean it. We apologize,\" but at the same time, you are getting no brakes. We might have screwed up but you're getting no delay in deadlines, you're still going to have to pay penalties. It's all on you. Doug.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: That's exactly right. Remember, the president said, \"This is more than a website,\" and they believe that deeply. They want the policies, they want the whole agenda, and they believe that they can get people to the polls one way or another. They've done it before. They think about it like a political campaign and they're going to try to get in there one way or another.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Congressman, you're an expert in IT. You've spent part of your career and IT, certainly in school in IT, you've studied it. Is <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>the right person to run what is a massive e-commerce website?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, apparently not because many, many mistakes were made. You know, I've looked through the contracts. I've seen the testing that was required to be performed under that contract. We know now that integration testing didn't even begin until two weeks prior to going live. They were supposed to do a full suite of testing, part of a pre-operational readiness review back in the fourth quarter of 2012 and then a final review with test results, test analysis, and all of that in the first quarter of 2013. And I can't find anyone there that will tell me whether that has occurred or not.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What grade do you give them? (INAUDIBLE) somebody who knows how well it done.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well, it's failed. It is absolutely an F. That's the grade they give.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. I want you to hear some more - this is from Congressman Mike Rogers questioning Sebelius on this very issue.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. MIKE ROGERS: You accepted a risk on behalf of every user of this computer that put their personal financial information at risk because you did not even have the most basic end-to-end test for security of the system. Amazon would never do this. Pro Flowers would never do this. Kayak would never do this.</p><p/><p>I will commit today secretary to shut down the system and do an end to end security test so that these Americans -</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: No, sir.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: All right. So if you heard the tail end of that, what she said is no. We are not shutting it down. We're not shutting it down for an end to end test even though that that may be the only way to find out what is wrong. Doug.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: This was a bull's-eye. This is a deep concern to the American public. The privacy of their personal information is paramounts. They played politics with this schedule. They played politics with the policy. But you can't play politics with people's privacy. That is going to hurt and then you can worry about it.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Or your health care, in my view. I think that is why people are so upset. This policy is right up in people's grill. It's about how much health care you get, what you're going to pay for it, what the quality of your life is really going to be like.</p><p/><p>Congressman, to you. I was amused to hear that the federal chief information officer today said, \"What we have been through is a teachable moment.\" What do you make of that?</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: A teachable moment?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A teachable moment.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: I would like to have him in my class because I have a few things that I would like to teach. You just don't get this far into an implementation with these many problems and think that you're going to be able to fix it. They may create a perception that it is being fixed, but I submit that it is going to cost millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars more to repair and replace this system than to simply fix it. It is badly, badly broken.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: We are still waiting on those numbers. We don't really know those numbers, how much it costs, how much of the taxpayer money were sunk into this.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Right. The transparency is terrible. For an administration that publicly prides itself on transparency, you can't find out anything in this process. I think there are too big lessons that are going to play in the debate for a long time.</p><p/><p>There is a generation of Americans who believed the president when he said that government solves problems. The government is an active force in your life. But they didn't understand government fails. And fails a lot. This is a massive failure. They're learning that lesson. They also will learn that this - the private sector succeeds because there is a financial incentive to make trades, make transactions. Why does the New York Stock Exchange work? That exchange works for a reason. So does the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, so does Amazon, so does Ebay. That is a lesson as well.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Gerri, the biggest concern that I've got right now is what he said. You know, it's easy to spend somebody else's money when it's not coming out of your pocket. I mean the American taxpayers have already paid for this system one time. And it was badly flawed.</p><p/><p>Now they're being asked to pay for it again because this new systems integrator, that was supposed to be independent, QSSI, that was part of the development team and part of the independent (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>WILLIS: In the first place.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: In the first place.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Is now going to be paid more to try and rescue this system. I want to know how they're going to recover the money and pay for this thing without taking (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>WILLIS: One of the scariest words in the English language. I'm from the government (INAUDIBLE). Guys, thanks for helping me out tonight. You did a great job. Thanks, congressman.</p><p/><p>Jonathan, Doug will be with us after the break.</p><p/><p>But first we want to know what you think. Here is our question tonight - do you buy Sebelius' apology? Log on to gerriwillis.com. Vote on the right hand side of the screen. I will show the results at the end of tonight's show. We got more and more to come. From Washington D.C., this hour, including calls for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to throw in the towel.</p><p/><p>And next, more on the lies and broken promises of this law, especially the one we got to keep your insurance plan. Remember that. Senator John Barrasso is here after the break. Stay with us.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Time and time again the president campaigning on this promise to the American people in his push for Obamacare.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you like your doctor you will be able to keep her doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: A promise broken hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times over as more insurance cancellations keep people - keep these pouring into the mailbox.</p><p/><p>We're live in D.C. bringing you the very latest on the Obamacare fiasco. Back with me now, Doug Holtz-Eakin from the American Action Forum. And joining us to is Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.</p><p/><p>Senator, I will start with you. You know, we have been talking about this broken promise. Essentially Democrats have said, you can't complain about the law. It's the law of the land. But if it was sold on bad information, what does that mean?</p><p/><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), TENNESSEE: Well, I think the president intentionally had these lines designed to deceive the American people. So they could force through of party-line vote a health care law that I think is bad for patients as well as doctors and nurses who take care of them as well as the taxpayers this - the problems with the website are only the tip of the iceberg. The law itself is fatally flawed in terms of keeping your doctor, in terms of all of these cancellations of policies. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I'm going to show some numbers on that right now because we have been running a tally on the cancellations. I've got something like - 1.7 million. If you add up all these numbers from all over the country, we're seeing hundreds of thousands of people getting cancellations every day.</p><p/><p>And in the testimony today, Sebelius was saying those aren't cancellations. If they're not cancellations , what are they?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They are cancellations, and there are more to come. Because there are more and more of these so-called grandfather plans where they will have to make enough changes to comply with the law that they'll be canceled. They're no longer legal for sale and that's that and it's because the law (INAUDIBLE) on that front.</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: And the regulations that they wrote afterwards because you have a tower of regulations that's going to be tall. They've really got very restrictive in the regulations when the president said \"If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance.\" It really only if the White House likes your insurance.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's right.</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: You can keep your insurance. And if the White House doesn't like your insurance you can keep it.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Essential health benefits. I want you to hear from Cory Gardner. He's a congressman who got up in today's hearing and said \"Here's my cancellation notice. I just got it.\" Listen to this.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO: This is the letter that my family got canceling our insurance. We chose to have our just have our own private policy back in Colorado so we could be in the same boat as every one of my constituents, and yet my insurance policy has been canceled. The White House website says if you like your health plan you can keep it. Did I hear it wrong?</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So you hear the congressman say he has lost his health insurance. He's very upset. He went on to say to <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>\"I think you should be enrolled in Obamacare. Why aren't you enrolled in Obamacare?\" What did you make of that exchange?</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: Well, I think that every employee in the White House ought to be involved and enrolled in the Obama health care law and (INAUDIBLE) to buy insurance on the exchanges. None of them - they all have exemptions from this health care law. I think they all should be involved. But he is right, and it is not just people losing their coverage but then they have to go and buy insurance, they're getting hit with sticker shock, Gerri, because they are seeing it's turning out to be a lot more expensive.</p><p/><p>Remember, the president promised easier to use than Amazon, the website, cheaper than your cellphone bill, and you can keep your doctor. And the American people feel deceived by the lines of the president.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Exactly.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And that is really important. Because the way they tried to keep prices down and there's a lot of sticker shock already, is to have tight networks. That means you probably won't get to see your doctor or go to the usual hospital.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I think we are all headed for RNs, I think at the end of the day. I want you to hear something from Congressman Lee Terry. Because another issue for me has been when are we going to get details, when are we going to know, understand how many people are being enrolled? It's an open question. Here is what he had to say.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>REP. LEE TERRY (R), NEBRASKA: That should be a pretty reliable number.</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: The system is not functioning. So we are not getting that reliable data.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So the secretary says essentially we don't know because we are not getting reliable data. Doug.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I find this the least believable in a long list of things that are believable.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That's not true.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Pick up the phone. Insurance companies in America know who they have signed up. If they have completed a contract with somebody, it has gone down to the billed out for premiums and they're going to know. Ask the insurers. How many have you signed up. How many have you signed up? Add (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I don't think the insurers have good information either.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They may not have the right information about who they signed up but they're going to know how many people have made it through the process. They have to.</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: And our insurance commissioner in the state of Wyoming, he has tried to log on to the website every day since October 1st, has not gotten through as of this past week. Lisa Markowsky, the senator from Alaska told a number of us today that they made the calls. There are three people in the state of Alaska who have been able to sign up.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Let me tell you, one thing that was almost missed in the coverage today because we weren't in the room. We're watching it on TV. They have a video up of the website. It was not available. You couldn't sign on during that very congressional hearing that is investigating why this website is not up. This is like prime time for the administration. If you are able to get this website to work, it would be during this congressional hearing. It did not happen.</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: And if you're ever going to try to convince young healthy individuals to sign up, they are losing this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: These are the people that have to sign up for the financing of the whole program to work. They're depending on 2.7 million young people to pay more for more insurance than they need to pay for older, sicker people.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p/><p>BARRASSO: And that is what this whole thing is built upon.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They touted some numbers. You heard the president, for example, say more than 60,000 people.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Those are all Medicaid recipients. Those are not people - the Oregon exchange has not yet opened. And so they are also not being clear about who is in what category. It will have a very, very, very (INAUDIBLE) rollout.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: If you have to guess the proportion of people who are signing up now, who are actually on Medicaid rather than Obamacare, what would it be?</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I guess 90 percent.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: We're going to have to leave it there. Senator, Doug, thanks for being with us. Great job. Fascinating conversation. Really appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And later in the show, hear what President Obama had to say following his secretary's testimony.</p><p/><p>Next, despite getting some praise for performance today many in Congress are calling for Sebelius to be fired, and one of those senators, Lamar Alexander, joins me next. Stay with us.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: The top Republican on the Senate's health panel calling for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to quit. His reaction to her testimony, next.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: With the unsuccessful rollout of the Obamacare website, many lawmakers have been calling for Health and Human Services secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to resign, adding to that, chorus of calls is the ranking member on the Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Earlier today, I spoke with him and asked him if he was satisfied with what he heard today.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), TENNESSEE: I'm not satisfied. She should step down. I mean, this is the private sector, that kind of performance would not be tolerated. And she should step down and somebody else should take charge.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, she said she was sorry. She said she regretted it. She says she's working on all the problems. Why isn't that good enough?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Well, it's not good enough. You know, Admiral Rickover created our nuclear navy and told the captains of the submarines, \"Look, you are in charge of the reactor, too. There is ever a problem with the reactor, your career is over.\" And so we never had a problem with the reactors. That's what we need here. We need accountability. Even in their public sector, we need accountability.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Accountability, a big theme with you. You know, you called for her resignation. You're not backing off right now. Interesting. You've asked for documents though and what you want is a weekly report.</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Sure.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What do you want to see?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Well, we want to know how many people have tried through the exchange to buy Obamacare, how many succeeded, in what zip code do they live, what level of insurance did they buy. We need to know that. We ought to know it every week. You know, before the internet age RCA knew how many records Elvis was selling every day. I mean, Ford knew how many cars it was selling every day. McDonald's could tell you how many hamburgers they're selling every day.</p><p/><p>Now we're in the middle of the internet age, the Obama administration should be able to tell us every day how many people are signing up. What are they buying?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Doesn't the problems with the website tell you just how dramatic this is. She seems to be saying \"We can't tell you. We don't know. We don't have the information.\" Do you buy that?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Well, if they don't know it is worse than I even think. The important thing is the website is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is going to be the canceled premiums, the millions of Americans who are going to find on January 1 that the premiums that the president said they could keep are being canceled because they are not legal under Obamacare. These businesses are going to be finding that the costs are so high they're going to drop a lot of their coverage and their employees are going into Medicaid, and businesses are also struggling because of the 30- hour work week requirement. They're going to have to cut pay, in fact, by putting employees on 30-hour work weeks to avoid the Obamacare requirement.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What do you mean these premiums aren't legal?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: What I mean is that under Obamacare only some insurance policies are legal. You may have an insurance policy with say a high deductible that you can afford and you like. The Obamacare may say that is as good enough for you, therefore that policy cannot be issued by an insurance company after January 1. So your policy is gone. So you then have to go on an exchange through a website that doesn't work to buy insurance or you will be fined by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Senator, that is an issue we have been talking a lot about this week. Hundreds of thousands of people already seeing their policies canceled, and for that very reason they don't meet the requirements of the Obama administration.</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: That's more than hundreds of thousands. I mean, just in California, Florida, and New Jersey. We've counted up at least a million and a half Americans whose policies will be cancelled on January 1 which is about 10 times the number of people who applied for insurance in just those three states.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Astonishing fast. And as we look forward, one of the things we are hearing is that the costs are a big debate. We don't know how much this thing is costing us. Here's what Sebelius had to say today about what she has paid out for this website. Listen to this -</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>BLACKBURN: Can you give me a ballpark of what you have spent on this website that does not work, that individuals can not get to. What is your cost estimate?</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: So far, Congresswoman, we have spent about $118 million on the website itself and about $56 million has been expended on other IT to support the web.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So that's $174 million. In last week's testimony, the IT contractors themselves say they spent nearly 500 million. So who is right? What's the real number?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Well, I don't know. I've heard 400. But the fact is, this is the president's signature achievement. He has had three and half years to do it. I used to be a governor, that's smaller potatoes. But on something that is important to me, I put somebody in charge. I'll be with him every week or every month and say is it on budget. Is it getting done? And if it's not I'll get somebody else to do it. I don't know how why the president has not been doing that.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: One final question, a couple of weeks ago, February 2010, you told the president \"if you put this program in place you're going to raise people's premiums and it's going to cause people more money.\" He said, \"You didn't have the facts straight.\" What is the reality?</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Well, the reality was then I was right and today I am proven right because I said, \"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has said that individual premiums are going to go up under your claim. You don't know the facts.\" It turns out today individual premiums and there are 19 million Americans who have those, are seeing premium increases of maybe 50 percent to 100 percent.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: But a long way to go. Senator, thanks for coming on the show tonight.</p><p/><p>ALEXANDER: Thank you.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Coming up, the calls for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to step down grow louder. Is the face of Obamacare ready to do that.</p><p/><p>Next, this secretary isn't the only White House official in front of a camera today. The president also offering his take.</p><p/><p>Our Rich Edson have the latest after the break.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington D.C., here again is Gerri Willis.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Welcome back to a special edition of \"The Willis Report.\" We are live from our nation's capital. President Obama skipping out of town to sell his signature policy in Boston. The president eagerly trying to compare Massachusetts health care law's low start to Obamacare's, Fox Business' Rich Edson have the latest.</p><p/><p>Rich, did the president comment on people losing their coverage?</p><p/><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: He did, Gerri, and it has become the primary criticism of the law this week, even overshadowing the botched rollout of healthcare.gov. President Obama said if Americans liked their substandard plans, they could have kept them. As for those who have seen their plans disappear, the president blamed insurance companies for canceling those policies. He then encourages Americans to find better Obamacare insurance.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>OBAMA: If you are getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace. That is what it's for. Because of the tax credits that we're offering and the competition between insurers, most people are going to be able to get better comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected. You are going to get a better deal.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>EDSON: Republicans say that the president lied when he was selling the proposal and that Americans largely cannot keep their cheaper, bare-bones insurance plans. The health care law was designed to phase out those policies, Gerri.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Rich, thank you. We appreciate your time.</p><p/><p><person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>sat in front of the House panel for three and a half long hours today, facing some tough questions. So what are the key takeaways? Let's get to it, joining me now, Avik Roy, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller. He is author of \"Why Obamacare is Wrong for America.\" Avik, I will start with you. You were in the hearing, what did you make of it?</p><p/><p>AVIK ROY, MANHATTAN INST.: I thought it was substantive. I thought there was a lot less of the grandstanding that you normally see at these kinds of hearings, but I think what I was struck by most of all was the depth and the scope and the breadth of the problems with the exchanges.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: They were all over the place, it was everything from technical glitches to people losing their coverage. It was--</p><p/><p>ROY: Front end, back-end, verifying with the IRS, the security and the privacy stuff that Congressman Rogers talked about that you played the clip of. It was just all over the place, and I look at this and I say, it is going to be a lot harder to fix this than I think a lot of people think.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I guess the problems are just starting, Tom. What did you make of the hearing?</p><p/><p>TOM MILLER, AEI: What is coming out more and more is that problems with Obamacare are features, not bugs, it's not just a matter of technical incompetence. We've had plenty of that, but you start with the inability of people to access the site, but then we are learning about these other concerns, that the prices are a big problem for people, people are losing their plans, security and privacy are real concerns. There has been misleading information out on the web site, telling people between the ages of 27 and 50, here is the standard price for everyone, even though it's going to vary, same thing for 50 and above. All of these reflect that this was designed in a way different than what was sold to the American public. The president said you can keep your plan period, he forgot to say there was a semicolon. He had a few extra clauses which said there are other conditions on that one.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: That is right. One of the things that nobody's talking about and really fascinates me, I don't feel that we really know <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>she is sort of a black box for a lot of us. We know she is not from around here. We know her dad was John Gilligan, who invented the state income tax, but beyond that, who is this woman running our health care?</p><p/><p>ROY: I have written a lot about <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>at my Forbes column and National Review, over the years, monitoring all the implementation of Obamacare, and what I can tell you is that she is arguably the most partisan operator at the cabinet level in the Obama administration. She has been very willing to change a lot of the things about the way that law is implemented, in order to maximize the political advantage of the administration. They postponed a lot of regulations dealing with the exchanges until after the election.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What about changing the shopping feature, that was politically motivated, Tom?</p><p/><p>MILLER: And it came in just the last couple of weeks. They will try to throw the private contractors under the bus. They can't go too far or the private contractors will start revealing some private memos, which will not look very good. But that was a clear turnoff to keep people from knowing what the real prices were in order to induce them into the exchange and getting them--</p><p/><p>WILLIS: One of the things people don't talk about, she is an old insurance commissioner, and that is often the job of someone who is very political, and somebody who really wants to hold the industry's feet to the fire.</p><p/><p>MILLER: She believed in regulation as the insurance commissioner in Kansas. We think of Kansas as this deeply conservative state. She was on the other side of the divided both as the insurance commissioner and as the governor. So she is not only a second-hand manager, she is a believer in this. And a direct (inaudible).</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You could hear in her voice, her commitment to this idea that everyone should get health care, that this is a national right. Is this a national right?</p><p/><p>ROY: It is a particular kind of healthcare. Her view is that insurance means you have to be covered for every single thing, whereas normally in the business world, we think of insurance as you get hit by a bus, you have a stroke, you are covered. She thinks of insurance as everything should be paid for -- birth control, your allergy pills.</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Someone said to me, while we had all these conversations, for so many months on Obamacare, if you wanted to get auto insurance, would you expect to go on the web and not tell anybody anything at all about your driving history? No, you would not, that would never happen, Tom, but that is exactly what is happening with Obamacare.</p><p/><p>MILLER: Well, we passed the law without knowing what was in it. Now we have coverage where after you enroll, maybe you'll find out what's in it.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Absolutely right. Avik?</p><p/><p>ROY: One of the things that is really important to understand about the architects of the law is they knew, they knew the web site was not ready, they knew eight months ago the web site wasn't ready. They only did the first end-to-end test of the web site one week before October 1, and yet they still launched the web site. And that is the question we didn't hear an answer to tonight or this morning. We didn't hear the answer to that question, you knew this web site was not ready yet you still launched it on October 1, why?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: There was a great exchange today on that issue of end-to-end testing. Why didn't you take the website down, someone suggested, and test end-to-end, so you can figure out where the problems are. Fix it, repair it, get it back up, she said we're not stopping it. And that the point I made at the top of the show, which is it seems her message today was, I am sorry we have problems, I am sorry we have mistakes, issues along the way, but it doesn't matter. We're going full steam ahead, right, Tom?</p><p/><p>MILLER: It was a politically driven operation. They knew what their political goals were first, the customers stood well behind that in terms of priorities, whether it was functional or not, they had to get something out on October 1. That drove all of the messiness and incomplete testing behind it.</p><p/><p>ROY: People who do software for a living are pulling their hair out, because they are looking at those kinds of decisions and say, no competent IT process would eve be run this way. And this is the most important IT project in modern history.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And it is the most important consumer story, I believe, going on right now. Tom and Avik, thank you for being with us. You'll be back later. Appreciate your time. Stay with us.</p><p/><p>When we come back, the truth behind these so-called glitches from the woman who helped redesign the WhiteHouse.gov under the Bush administration, she has great advice coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>on the hot seat, as she battles to rebound from the flawed Obamacare rollout. So who exactly is <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>and what does the future hold for her? We're back with Avik Roy from the Manhattan Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller. Welcome back to both of you. You know, the conversation got heated several times, and it was funny, she got a little flustered a couple of times. I want you to hear this exchange between the secretary and Congressman Harper.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are saying that the president is not responsible for HHS?</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: Sir, I didn't say that.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, so the president ultimately is responsible -- while I think it is great you are a team player, and you are taking responsibility, it is the president's ultimate responsibility, correct?</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: You clearly -- whatever. Yes, he is the president, he is responsible for government programs.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Tom, is it all about accountability here? Is it all about where the buck stops? I think she was trying to say, Sebelius today, that it stops with me, but I have a sense this was all for show?</p><p/><p>MILLER: Well, this is the unaccountable care act, done politically at least. <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>is making a virtue out of her ignorance. As long as she can say I don't really know anything about this technology, you don't have to look any further under the hood. But she is also there to serve the president. She is the heat shield, because if she's not in the way, people say to the man in the White House, did Bo chew your homework, or what did you do in terms of administrating the country?</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Certainly the spotlight goes back on the president. Big question tonight, a lot of people are asking, should she resign?</p><p/><p>ROY: The president said last week, it is not just a web site, Obamacare is not just a web site, it is a whole law that changes the health care system. Republicans agree. It's not just a web site. It is the underlying architectural law, and if you replace <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>the flawed architectural law would still exist. So I don't see what that accomplishes, frankly.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, she's going to lead this, she's going to take heat, would it be better to have somebody else in the job?</p><p/><p>MILLER: You can't confirm a full-time secretary in this political environment. So you lose technically the ability--</p><p/><p>WILLIS: No way to get that done.</p><p/><p>MILLER: You need votes.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Can't get it done--</p><p/><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p/><p>MILLER: -- more rounds of hearings about how HHS is run.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So at the end of the day, she is going to keep her job, at least for the present, and she is going to be in charge of fixing what she has not been able to put in place for three years.</p><p/><p>ROY: And that is why she can say I am responsible for this debacle, because she's secure in her job, she knows she can take the arrows and she has the confidence of the president. But, will she fix it? She can't, she is responsible, she is -- the White House and HHS are both responsible for this mess, because that October 1 launch date, that was the White House's decision to say we're going to stick to this October 1 launch date, even if we're not ready, even if everyone tells us we're not ready.</p><p/><p>MILLER: There is another launch date, which is January 1st, where people have lost their coverage, and where the exchange coverage begins. I believe that the president will carry out a time honored tradition, on opening day he throws out the first scapegoat, and it might be <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius.</nameText></person></p><p/><p>ROY: It's kind of like Macbeth. Macbeth says, well, my hands are bloodied, so should I just kill everyone else or should I just stop now. And I think they are at the I'm going to kill everyone else day.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: You are gleeful in what's going on, which is a tragedy for the American people. We were talking earlier in the show about hundreds of thousands of people losing their coverage tonight. California, Florida, all over the country. Tom, to you, this is playing out in the living rooms now.</p><p/><p>ROY: It's real.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Not just a congressional hearing, that is in fact just a television set, let's face it, this is a real story.</p><p/><p>MILLER: And that is what changes this from I'm going to give you another speech, I'm going to tell you what is coming, here is what it's going to be. Instead it all of a sudden shows up in the daily lives of the average Americans, even the loss of coverage thing that's due to the grandfathering rules, it's actually due to a lot of the provisions in the law, which are literally outlawing coverage, whether or not you are grandfathered. There are other requirements in the law which means that these old individual plans no longer qualify as legitimate plans in the marketplace.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And we've certainly seen a lot of that. As I was saying, hundreds of thousands of people losing their coverage, but not everyone wants coverage in case they get pregnant, or mental health coverage.</p><p/><p>ROY: To your point about how this is a living room issue now, the politics are a lose-lose for the administration. If they were to shut down the web site, there would be a temporary humiliation, but the American people would be better off, the American people would be better off if we delayed this law, get the web site rebuilt, allow people to have their existing coverage until the new law is built out. They don't want to do that, and that is a real problem, and I think a lot of people will be upset about this.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: I think we have to move to a conversation about solutions, because it is really not enough to say this is not working, we don't like it, we don't like the president, that's a really -- that's boring, right? What do you do to fix it?</p><p/><p>MILLER: There are short-term patches, they are difficult though because the law, the provisions are so interrelated. You move this over here, you create a problem somewhere else. You can change the mandate date, or delay it, then that affects some of the coverage projections. So you can expand the enrollment period, same problem. So what you probably have got to do, which we don't have the leverage for, is to say if there is a plan on the marketplace that you used to buy before, you can keep it, and it can still be a valid plan. That is the first step. You make this a lot less complex.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Today she said I'm not doing that, we're not going to do that. We're not going to extend the enrollment period. You cannot have a 12 month enrollment period.</p><p/><p>ROY: There has been a bill introduced by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, he has introduced a bill that is also being introduced by Upton in the Energy and Commerce Committee, to say if you had a plan in 2013 that was legal, you can keep it in 2014. And if -- there are a couple of Democrats in the Senate, Mary Landrieu announced she is in favor of that approach. So I think you might see something like that get through Congress.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Well, we'll have to wait and see. I know that secretary of health and human services does not like it. Maybe there will be cooler heads that prevail.</p><p/><p>MILLER: Security Sebelius will feel comfortable and secure in her job until the president says, you are doing a heck of a job, Kathleen.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Thank you for being on, Avik and Tom. Great job, thanks so much.</p><p/><p>Still to come, my two cents more, and Secretary Sebelius says Obamacare web site has been miserably frustrating, but it has not crashed. We'll separate fact from fiction with the former White House chief information officer. You want to see that, coming up.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Countless Americans are struggling to find quality, affordable health care coverage on the Obamacare web site. Americans like 62-year-old David Byron (ph), who last night on our show told us it took days to navigate all the glitches, and he is now on hold for another 45 days. Meanwhile, here in Washington, politicians are debating whether the web site problems are really all that bad.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The program has crashed and burned at least three times, it has been down the whole time you've been testifying, the system is down at this moment.</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: I would suggest that the web site has never crashed.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Joining me now Theresa Payton, former White House chief information officer under President George W. Bush. She was tasked with redesigning the WhiteHouse.Gov web site. Theresa, thank you for joining us. I have to ask you, how in the world can you say that this web site has not crashed?</p><p/><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORMER WH CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER: I think this is very difficult. You know, a lot of times techies get caught up in the site didn't crash, it is actually that the site is just slow or a form is not working. And in this case, if you think about it, the customer is king here, and what we learned at the White House is, if they came to the site, could not get the information they wanted, in their mind it crashed.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Exactly. I think that is what so many people take away. And during the entire hearing, practically, the site was down. So it was right there in front of everyone to see. Shocking, the other big tech question, everybody was talking about it, was privacy. I'm sure as you know, there was a language buried deep in the web site, that said you really can't trust this site to keep your privacy safe. Sebelius countered that. Here is what she said.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: That is boilerplate language that should not have been in this particular contract, because there are the highest security standards are in place, and people have every right to expect privacy.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: So Theresa, she said we are going to get rid of this. It will not be on the web site anymore, but does that mean we're safe or does that mean a line of code they just got rid of? What does it mean?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: I think this is more complicated than that. You are absolutely right. And on the first thing, I was glad to hear her say, we have a right to expect privacy. So I hope, to get customer confidence back, they will actually create a privacy policy we can all read and understand. And it should be front and center on this web site.</p><p/><p>The second piece, is even a great privacy and security policy does not mean that the web site is not hackable. So, people need to take precautions and keep that in mind as they are putting information on the web site.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Theresa, isn't it true, I just read this today, they are having problems with a password reset that is causing an opportunity for hackers out there, and from I read in the trades, what they are saying is it's not unusual that there is a problem. The problem is that they have not found it yet, and why was it not fixed, why was it not fixed immediately. What do you say to that?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Well, you know, one thing that I learned in my time at Banking and at the White House is, time and testing can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It sounds like they feel they did not have enough time to actually test.</p><p/><p>In this situation, with the password reset, one of the things that we can't control is some of these bugs in the system. So a piece of advice I have for everyone is, there will be other bugs, it could put your data at risk. So go ahead and get a unique e-mail address that is not attached to your bank account or the rest of your life, and use that unique e-mail address just for health care. That way if the bad guys get in, and get your data, it is going to be harder for them to take over the rest of your accounts online.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Theresa, that is great advice. I want to play one more piece of sound, this is Congressman Rogers asking Sebelius about testing. Here it is.</p><p/><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Has each piece of that code that has been introduced in the system been security tested?</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: That is my understanding, yes, sir.</p><p/><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each piece of that code has been tested? Yes or no.</p><p/><p>SEBELIUS: I don't know.</p><p/><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: What do you make of that, Theresa? It sounds like she is confused about what they've done, what they haven't done. Were you surprised?</p><p/><p>PAYTON: I was a little surprised, because any program manager worth their weight would make sure there was a good full testing plan. And there are automated testing tools, it does not just require bodies these days. You can actually program testing tools to test all kinds of scenarios. So I think one of the questions that needs to be asked, is how do you answer the testing questions to the satisfaction for the security team, and do we have data in grave danger of either being corrupted or stolen? I think that is a key question that needs to be answered.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: And not answered yet. So many questions, so few answers on the technical difficulties with the web site. Theresa, thanks for coming in tonight and chatting with us about it. We appreciate your time.</p><p/><p>PAYTON: Thanks for having me.</p><p/><p>WILLIS: We'll be right back with my two cents more and the answer to the question of the day, do you buy Sebelius' apology? Stay with us.</p><p/><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p/><p>WILLIS: Finally tonight, kudos to <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>for admitting her role in the debacle that is the Obamacare web site. But now to the people's problem, since the site does not work and people cannot get on the site to fulfill the requirements of the law, why wouldn't we delay the mandate further? When the administration can't get the centerpiece of its key program working in the middle of a congressional hearing on its lack of competency, well, that is a sign that continuing to push forward makes no sense. But the administration is not waiting. Sorry we screwed up, but there will be no delays in the mandate. Apology for the mistake, but you'll still face penalties if you do not apply. We're taking responsibility for our screwups, but we are forging ahead anyway, sorry.</p><p/><p>I'm reminded what the secretary muttered under her breath as the congressman began to ask her why she had not applied for coverage -- don't do this to me, she said. Indeed, don't do this to us. That's my two cents more. And that's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you right here. Well, not right here, but in New York tomorrow. Have a good night.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2013 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

I'm Gerri Willis. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight on a special edition of THE WILLIS REPORT, live from Washington,  D.C., hey it's sorry but nothing is changing. That's the takeaway from  Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testifying before the  House Energy and Commerce Committee on the Obamacare website mess today.   She's apologizing but not rolling back on deadlines.  Americans will still  have to pay fines if they don't play along with the White House's tune.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to weigh in, Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Form  and Republican congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio who is at the hearing  today.  Doug, I'm going to start with you.  We got an apology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DOUG HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM PRESIDENT:  Yes.</p><p>WILLIS:  Obviously - were you satisfied with what you heard?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Well, I thought the secretary did a good job, quite frankly.   She had the right demeanor.  I thought the apology rang true.  And she did  her job in that she answered the question she wanted to answer and she  didn't answer the ones that they did not want her to talk about.</p><p>WILLIS:  It was a lot that didn't get answered today.  We will hit on some  of that.  But you know, this got testy testing many, many times.  And  Sebelius telling Marsha Blackburn the congresswoman to hold her  accountable.  Even that was testy.  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARSHA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Who is in charge, madam secretary? </p><p>KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, HHS SECRETARY:  The person now in charge as an  integrator is QSSI, one of our -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Who was in charge?</p><p>SEBELIUS:  -- was in charge -</p><p>BLACKBURN:  AT that team who is the individual -</p><p>SEBELIUS:  Michele Snyder.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Michele Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle.</p><p>SEBELIUS:  Well, excuse me, congresswoman, Michele Snyder is not  responsible for the debacle, hold me accountable for the debacle.  I'm  responsible.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm responsible.  You just heard that from the secretary of Health  and Human Services.  </p><p>Congressman, if she's accountable, why does she still have the job?</p><p>REP. BILL JOHNSON (R), OHIO:  Well, that's a good question.  You know,  Kathleen Sebelius serves at the pleasure of the president, as does the lady  that she said was in charge.  If that's the kind of performance that they  are willing to tolerate, I can tell you my experience as a program manager,  I would not have had a job if I had performed like this.</p><p>WILLIS:  You know, I think in the private sector nobody understands what's  going on.  I tell you in New York we are all mystified.  But here in  Washington, different rules apply.  Here is my big question.  And my take  away from the whole thing today.  She seemed to be saying, \"We are sorry.   We are sorry.  We really didn't mean it.  We apologize,\"  but at the same  time, you are getting no brakes.  We might have screwed up but you're  getting no delay in deadlines, you're still going to have to pay penalties.   It's all on you.  Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  That's exactly right.  Remember, the president said, \"This is  more than a website,\" and they believe that deeply.  They want the  policies, they want the whole agenda, and they believe that they can get  people to the polls one way or another.  They've done it before.  They  think about it like a political campaign and they're going to try to get in  there one way or another.</p><p>WILLIS:  Congressman, you're an expert in IT.  You've spent part of your  career and IT, certainly in school in IT, you've studied it.  Is Kathleen  Sebelius the right person to run what is a massive e-commerce website?</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, apparently not because many, many mistakes were made.  You  know, I've looked through the contracts.  I've seen the testing that was  required to be performed under that contract.  We know now that integration  testing didn't even begin until two weeks prior to going live.  They were  supposed to do a full suite of testing, part of a pre-operational readiness  review back in the fourth quarter of 2012 and then a final review with test  results, test analysis, and all of that in the first quarter of 2013.  And  I can't find anyone there that will tell me whether that has occurred or  not.</p><p>WILLIS:  What grade do you give them?  (INAUDIBLE) somebody who knows how  well it done.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well, it's failed.  It is absolutely an F.  That's the grade they  give.</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  I want you to hear some more - this is from  Congressman Mike Rogers questioning Sebelius on this very issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MIKE ROGERS:  You accepted a risk on behalf of every user of this  computer that put their personal financial information at risk because you  did not even have the most basic end-to-end test for security of the  system.  Amazon would never do this.  Pro Flowers would never do this.   Kayak would never do this.</p><p>I will commit today secretary to shut down the system and do an end to end  security test so that these Americans -</p><p>SEBELIUS:  No, sir.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  All right.  So if you heard the tail end of that, what she said is  no.  We are not shutting it down.  We're not shutting it down for an end to  end test even though that that may be the only way to find out what is  wrong.  Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  This was a bull's-eye.  This is a deep concern to the  American public.  The privacy of their personal information is paramounts.   They played politics with this schedule.  They played politics with the  policy.  But you can't play politics with people's privacy.  That is going  to hurt and then you can worry about it.</p><p>WILLIS:  Or your health care, in my view.  I think that is why people are  so upset.  This policy is right up in people's grill.  It's about how much  health care you get, what you're going to pay for it, what the quality of  your life is really going to be like.</p><p>Congressman, to you.  I was amused to hear that the federal chief  information officer today said, \"What we have been through is a teachable  moment.\"  What do you make of that?</p><p>JOHNSON:  A teachable moment?</p><p>WILLIS:  A teachable moment.</p><p>JOHNSON:  I would like to have him in my class because I have a few things  that I would like to teach.  You just don't get this far into an  implementation with these many problems and think that you're going to be  able to fix it.  They may create a perception that it is being fixed, but I  submit that it is going to cost millions, if not hundreds of millions of  dollars more to repair and replace this system than to simply fix it.  It  is badly, badly broken.</p><p>WILLIS:  We are still waiting on those numbers.  We don't really know those  numbers, how much it costs, how much of the taxpayer money were sunk into  this.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Right.  The transparency is terrible.  For an administration  that publicly prides itself on transparency, you can't find out anything in  this process.  I think there are too big lessons that are going to play in  the debate for a long time.</p><p>There is a generation of Americans who believed the president when he said  that government solves problems.  The government is an active force in your  life.  But they didn't understand government fails.  And fails a lot.  This  is a massive failure.  They're learning that lesson.  They also will learn  that this - the private sector succeeds because there is a financial  incentive to make trades, make transactions.  Why does the New York Stock  Exchange work?  That exchange works for a reason.  So does the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange, so does Amazon, so does Ebay.  That is a lesson as  well.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Gerri, the biggest concern that I've got right now is what he  said.  You know, it's easy to spend somebody else's money when it's not  coming out of your pocket.  I mean the American taxpayers have already paid  for this system one time.  And it was badly flawed.</p><p>Now they're being asked to pay for it again because this new systems  integrator, that was supposed to be independent, QSSI, that was part of the  development team and part of the independent (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS:  In the first place.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  In the first place.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Is now going to be paid more to try and rescue this system.  I  want to know how they're going to recover the money and pay for this thing  without taking (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS:  One of the scariest words in the English language.  I'm from the  government (INAUDIBLE).  Guys, thanks for helping me out tonight.  You did  a great job.  Thanks, congressman.</p><p>Jonathan, Doug will be with us after the break.</p><p>But first we want to know what you think.  Here is our question tonight -  do you buy Sebelius' apology?  Log on to gerriwillis.com.  Vote on the  right hand side of the screen.  I will show the results at the end of  tonight's show.  We got more and more to come.  From Washington D.C., this  hour, including calls for Kathleen Sebelius to throw in the towel.</p><p>And next, more on the lies and broken promises of this law, especially the  one we got to keep your insurance plan.  Remember that.  Senator John  Barrasso is here after the break.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS: Time and time again the president campaigning on this promise to  the American people in his push for Obamacare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  If you like your doctor you  will be able to keep her doctor.  Period.  If you like your health care  plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan.  Period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  A promise broken hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times  over as more insurance cancellations keep people - keep these pouring into  the mailbox.</p><p>We're live in D.C. bringing you the very latest on the Obamacare fiasco.   Back with me now, Doug Holtz-Eakin from the American Action Forum.  And  joining us to is Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.</p><p>Senator, I will start with you.  You know, we have been talking about this  broken promise.  Essentially Democrats have said, you can't complain about  the law.  It's the law of the land.  But if it was sold on bad information,  what does that mean?</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), TENNESSEE:  Well, I think the president  intentionally had these lines designed to deceive the American people.  So  they could force through of party-line vote a health care law that I think  is bad for patients as well as doctors and nurses who take care of them as  well as the taxpayers this - the problems with the website are only the tip  of the iceberg.  The law itself is fatally flawed in terms of keeping your  doctor, in terms of all of these cancellations of policies.  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS:  I'm going to show some numbers on that right now because we have  been running a tally on the cancellations.  I've got something like - 1.7  million.  If you add up all these numbers from all over the country, we're  seeing hundreds of thousands of people getting cancellations every day.</p><p>And in the testimony today, Sebelius was saying those aren't cancellations.   If they're not cancellations , what are they?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  They are cancellations, and there are more to come.  Because  there are more and more of these so-called grandfather plans where they  will have to make enough changes to comply with the law that they'll be  canceled.  They're no longer legal for sale and that's that and it's  because the law (INAUDIBLE) on that front.</p><p>BARRASSO:  And the regulations that they wrote afterwards because you have  a tower of regulations that's going to be tall.  They've really got very  restrictive in the regulations when the president said \"If you like your  insurance, you can keep your insurance.\"  It really only if the White House  likes your insurance.</p><p>WILLIS:  That's right.</p><p>BARRASSO:  You can keep your insurance.  And if the White House doesn't  like your insurance you can keep it.</p><p>WILLIS:  Essential health benefits.  I want you to hear from Cory Gardner.   He's a congressman who got up in today's hearing and said \"Here's my  cancellation notice. I just got it.\"  Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO:  This is the letter that my family got  canceling our insurance.  We chose to have our just have our own private  policy back in Colorado so we could be in the same boat as every one of my  constituents, and yet my insurance policy has been canceled.  The White  House website says if you like your health plan you can keep it.  Did I  hear it wrong?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  So you hear the congressman say he has lost his health insurance.   He's very upset.  He went on to say to Kathleen Sebelius, \"I think you  should be enrolled in Obamacare.  Why aren't you enrolled in Obamacare?\"   What did you make of that exchange?</p><p>BARRASSO:  Well, I think that every employee in the White House ought to be  involved and enrolled in the Obama health care law and (INAUDIBLE) to buy  insurance on the exchanges.  None of them - they all have exemptions from  this health care law.  I think they all should be involved.  But he is  right, and it is not just people losing their coverage but then they have  to go and buy insurance, they're getting hit with sticker shock, Gerri,  because they are seeing it's turning out to be a lot more expensive.</p><p>Remember, the president promised easier to use than Amazon, the website,  cheaper than your cellphone bill, and you can keep your doctor.  And the  American people feel deceived by the lines of the president.</p><p>WILLIS:  Exactly.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  And that is really important.  Because the way they tried to  keep prices down and there's a lot of sticker shock already, is to have  tight networks.  That means you probably won't get to see your doctor or go  to the usual hospital.</p><p>WILLIS:  I think we are all headed for RNs, I think at the end of the day.   I want you to hear something from Congressman Lee Terry.  Because another  issue for me has been when are we going to get details, when are we going  to know, understand how many people are being enrolled?  It's an open  question.  Here is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LEE TERRY (R), NEBRASKA:  That should be a pretty reliable number.</p><p>SEBELIUS:  The system is not functioning.  So we are not getting that  reliable data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  So the secretary says essentially we don't know because we are not  getting reliable data.  Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I find this the least believable in a long list of things  that are believable.</p><p>WILLIS:  That's not true.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Pick up the phone.  Insurance companies in America know who  they have signed up.  If they have completed a contract with somebody, it  has gone down to the billed out for premiums and they're going to know.   Ask the insurers.  How many have you signed up.  How many have you signed  up?  Add (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS:  I don't think the insurers have good information either.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  They may not have the right information about who they signed  up but they're going to know how many people have made it through the  process.  They have to.</p><p>BARRASSO:  And our insurance commissioner in the state of Wyoming, he has  tried to log on to the website every day since October 1st, has not gotten  through as of this past week.  Lisa Markowsky, the senator from Alaska told  a number of us today that they made the calls.  There are three people in  the state of Alaska who have been able to sign up.</p><p>WILLIS: Let me tell you, one thing that was almost missed in the coverage  today because we weren't in the room.  We're watching it on TV.  They have  a video up of the website.  It was not available.  You couldn't sign on  during that very congressional hearing that is investigating why this  website is not up.  This is like prime time for the administration.  If you  are able to get this website to work, it would be during this congressional  hearing.  It did not happen.</p><p>BARRASSO:  And if you're ever going to try to convince young healthy  individuals to sign up, they are losing this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARRASSO:  These are the people that have to sign up for the financing of  the whole program to work.  They're depending on 2.7 million young people  to pay more for more insurance than they need to pay for older, sicker  people.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.</p><p>BARRASSO:  And that is what this whole thing is built upon.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  They touted some numbers.  You heard the president, for  example, say more than 60,000 people.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Those are all Medicaid recipients.  Those are not people -  the Oregon exchange has not yet opened.  And so they are also not being  clear about who is in what category.  It will have a very, very, very  (INAUDIBLE) rollout.</p><p>WILLIS:  If you have to guess the proportion of people who are signing up  now, who are actually on Medicaid rather than Obamacare, what would it be?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  I guess 90 percent.</p><p>WILLIS:  We're going to have to leave it there.  Senator, Doug, thanks for  being with us.  Great job.  Fascinating conversation.  Really appreciate  your time.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN:  Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS:  And later in the show, hear what President Obama had to say  following his secretary's testimony.</p><p>Next, despite getting some praise for performance today many in Congress  are calling for Sebelius to be fired, and one of those senators, Lamar  Alexander, joins me next.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  The top Republican on the Senate's health panel calling for  Kathleen Sebelius to quit.  His reaction to her testimony, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  With the unsuccessful rollout of the Obamacare website, many  lawmakers have been calling for Health and Human Services secretary  Kathleen Sebelius to resign, adding to that, chorus of calls is the ranking  member on the Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar  Alexander of Tennessee.  Earlier today, I spoke with him and asked him if  he was satisfied with what he heard today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), TENNESSEE:  I'm not satisfied.  She should step  down.  I mean, this is the private sector, that kind of performance would  not be tolerated.  And she should step down and somebody else should take  charge.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, she said she was sorry.  She said she regretted it.  She  says she's working on all the problems.  Why isn't that good enough?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Well, it's not good enough.  You know, Admiral Rickover created  our nuclear navy and told the captains of the submarines, \"Look, you are in  charge of the reactor, too.  There is ever a problem with the reactor, your  career is over.\"  And so we never had a problem with the reactors.  That's  what we need here.  We need accountability.  Even in their public sector,  we need accountability.</p><p>WILLIS:  Accountability, a big theme with you.  You know, you called for  her resignation.  You're not backing off right now.  Interesting.  You've  asked for documents though and what you want is a weekly report.</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Sure.</p><p>WILLIS:  What do you want to see?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Well, we want to know how many people have tried through the  exchange to buy Obamacare, how many succeeded, in what zip code do they  live, what level of insurance did they buy.  We need to know that.  We  ought to know it every week.  You know, before the internet age RCA knew  how many records Elvis was selling every day.  I mean, Ford knew how many  cars it was selling every day.  McDonald's could tell you how many  hamburgers they're selling every day.</p><p>Now we're in the middle of the internet age, the Obama administration  should be able to tell us every day how many people are signing up.  What  are they buying?</p><p>WILLIS:  Doesn't the problems with the website tell you just how dramatic  this is.  She seems to be saying \"We can't tell you.  We don't know.  We  don't have the information.\"  Do you buy that?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Well, if they don't know it is worse than I even think.  The  important thing is the website is not the biggest problem.  The biggest  problem is going to be the canceled premiums, the millions of Americans who  are going to find on January 1 that the premiums that the president said  they could keep are being canceled because they are not legal under  Obamacare.  These businesses are going to be finding that the costs are so  high they're going to drop a lot of their coverage and their employees are  going into Medicaid, and businesses are also struggling because of the 30- hour work week requirement.  They're going to have to cut pay, in fact, by  putting employees on 30-hour work weeks to avoid the Obamacare requirement.</p><p>WILLIS:  What do you mean these premiums aren't legal?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  What I mean is that under Obamacare only some insurance  policies are legal.  You may have an insurance policy with say a high  deductible that you can afford and you like.  The Obamacare may say that is  as good enough for you, therefore that policy cannot be issued by an  insurance company after January 1.  So your policy is gone.  So you then  have to go on an exchange through a website that doesn't work to buy  insurance or you will be fined by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>WILLIS:  Senator, that is an issue we have been talking a lot about this  week.  Hundreds of thousands of people already seeing their policies  canceled, and for that very reason they don't meet the requirements of the  Obama administration.</p><p>ALEXANDER:  That's more than hundreds of thousands.  I mean, just in  California, Florida, and New Jersey.  We've counted up at least a million  and a half Americans whose policies will be cancelled on January 1 which is  about 10 times the number of people who applied for insurance in just those  three states.</p><p>WILLIS:  Astonishing fast.  And as we look forward, one of the things we  are hearing is that the costs are a big debate.  We don't know how much  this thing is costing us.  Here's what Sebelius had to say today about what  she has paid out for this website.  Listen to this -</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Can you give me a ballpark of what you have spent on this  website that does not work, that individuals can not get to.  What is your  cost estimate?</p><p>SEBELIUS:  So far, Congresswoman, we have spent about $118 million on the  website itself and about $56 million has been expended on other IT to  support the web.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  So that's $174 million.  In last week's testimony, the IT  contractors themselves say they spent nearly 500 million.  So who is right?   What's the real number?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Well, I don't know.  I've heard 400.  But the fact is, this is  the president's signature achievement.  He has had three and half years to  do it.  I used to be a governor, that's smaller potatoes.  But on something  that is important to me, I put somebody in charge.  I'll be with him every  week or every month and say is it on budget.  Is it getting done?  And if  it's not I'll get somebody else to do it.  I don't know how why the  president has not been doing that.</p><p>WILLIS:  One final question, a couple of weeks ago, February 2010, you told  the president \"if you put this program in place you're going to raise  people's premiums and it's going to cause people more money.\"  He said,  \"You didn't have the facts straight.\"  What is the reality?</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Well, the reality was then I was right and today I am proven  right because I said, \"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has  said that individual premiums are going to go up under your claim.  You  don't know the facts.\"  It turns out today individual premiums and there  are 19 million Americans who have those, are seeing premium increases of  maybe 50 percent to 100 percent.</p><p>WILLIS:  But a long way to go.  Senator, thanks for coming on the show  tonight.</p><p>ALEXANDER:  Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS:  Coming up, the calls for Kathleen Sebelius to step down grow  louder.  Is the face of Obamacare ready to do that.</p><p>Next, this secretary isn't the only White House official in front of a  camera today.  The president also offering his take.</p><p>Our Rich Edson have the latest after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANNOUNCER:  Live from Washington D.C., here again is Gerri Willis.</p><p>WILLIS:  Welcome back to a special edition of \"The Willis Report.\"  We are  live from our nation's capital.  President Obama skipping out of town to  sell his signature policy in Boston.  The president eagerly trying to  compare Massachusetts health care law's low start to Obamacare's, Fox  Business' Rich Edson have the latest.</p><p>Rich, did the president comment on people losing their coverage? </p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  He did, Gerri, and it has become the  primary criticism of the law this week, even overshadowing the botched  rollout of healthcare.gov.  President Obama said if Americans liked their  substandard plans, they could have kept them.  As for those who have seen  their plans disappear, the president blamed insurance companies for  canceling those policies. He then encourages Americans to find better  Obamacare insurance.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA:  If you are getting one of these letters, just shop around in the  new marketplace.  That is what it's for.  Because of the tax credits that  we're offering and the competition between insurers, most people are going  to be able to get better comprehensive health care plans for the same price  or even cheaper than projected.  You are going to get a better deal.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  Republicans say that the president lied when he was selling the  proposal and that Americans largely cannot keep their cheaper, bare-bones  insurance plans.  The health care law was designed to phase out those  policies, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS:  Rich, thank you.  We appreciate your time.  </p><p>Kathleen Sebelius sat in front of the House panel for three and a half long  hours today, facing some tough questions.  So what are the key takeaways?   Let's get to it, joining me now, Avik Roy, senior fellow at the Manhattan  Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller.  He is author of \"Why Obamacare is  Wrong for America.\"  Avik, I will start with you.  You were in the hearing,  what did you make of it?  </p><p>AVIK ROY, MANHATTAN INST.:  I thought it was substantive.  I thought there  was a lot less of the grandstanding that you normally see at these kinds of  hearings, but I think what I was struck by most of all was the depth and  the scope and the breadth of the problems with the exchanges.  </p><p>WILLIS:  They were all over the place, it was everything from technical  glitches to people losing their coverage.  It was--</p><p>ROY:  Front end, back-end, verifying with the IRS, the security and the  privacy stuff that Congressman Rogers talked about that you played the clip  of.  It was just all over the place, and I look at this and I say, it is  going to be a lot harder to fix this than I think a lot of people think.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I guess the problems are just starting, Tom.  What did you make of  the hearing?  </p><p>TOM MILLER, AEI:  What is coming out more and more is that problems with  Obamacare are features, not bugs, it's not just a matter of technical  incompetence.  We've had plenty of that, but you start with the inability  of people to access the site, but then we are learning about these other  concerns, that the prices are a big problem for people, people are losing  their plans, security and privacy are real concerns.  There has been  misleading information out on the web site, telling people between the ages  of 27 and 50, here is the standard price for everyone, even though it's  going to vary, same thing for 50 and above.  All of these reflect that this  was designed in a way different than what was sold to the American public.   The president said you can keep your plan period, he forgot to say there  was a semicolon.  He had a few extra clauses which said there are other  conditions on that one.</p><p>WILLIS:  That is right.  One of the things that nobody's talking about and  really fascinates me, I don't feel that we really know Kathleen Sebelius,  she is sort of a black box for a lot of us.  We know she is not from around  here. We know her dad was John Gilligan, who invented the state income tax,  but beyond that, who is this woman running our health care? </p><p>ROY:  I have written a lot about Kathleen Sebelius at my Forbes column and  National Review, over the years, monitoring all the implementation of  Obamacare, and what I can tell you is that she is arguably the most  partisan operator at the cabinet level in the Obama administration.  She  has been very willing to change a lot of the things about the way that law  is implemented, in order to maximize the political advantage of the  administration.  They postponed a lot of regulations dealing with the  exchanges until after the election.  </p><p>WILLIS:  What about changing the shopping feature, that was politically  motivated, Tom?</p><p>MILLER:  And it came in just the last couple of weeks.  They will try to  throw the private contractors under the bus.  They can't go too far or the  private contractors will start revealing some private memos, which will not  look very good.  But that was a clear turnoff to keep people from knowing  what the real prices were in order to induce them into the exchange and  getting them--</p><p>WILLIS:  One of the things people don't talk about, she is an old insurance  commissioner, and that is often the job of someone who is very political,  and somebody who really wants to hold the industry's feet to the fire.  </p><p>MILLER:  She believed in regulation as the insurance commissioner in  Kansas.  We think of Kansas as this deeply conservative state.  She was on  the other side of the divided both as the insurance commissioner and as the  governor.  So she is not only a second-hand manager, she is a believer in  this.  And a direct (inaudible).</p><p>WILLIS:  You could hear in her voice, her commitment to this idea that  everyone should get health care, that this is a national right.  Is this a  national right? </p><p>ROY:  It is a particular kind of healthcare.  Her view is that insurance  means you have to be covered for every single thing, whereas normally in  the business world, we think of insurance as you get hit by a bus, you have  a stroke, you are covered.  She thinks of insurance as everything should be  paid for -- birth control, your allergy pills.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Someone said to me, while we had all these conversations, for so  many months on Obamacare, if you wanted to get auto insurance, would you  expect to go on the web and not tell anybody anything at all about your  driving history?  No, you would not, that would never happen, Tom, but that  is exactly what is happening with Obamacare.  </p><p>MILLER:  Well, we passed the law without knowing what was in it.  Now we  have coverage where after you enroll, maybe you'll find out what's in it.    </p><p>WILLIS:  Absolutely right. Avik?</p><p>ROY:  One of the things that is really important to understand about the  architects of the law is they knew, they knew the web site was not ready,  they knew eight months ago the web site wasn't ready.  They only did the  first end-to-end test of the web site one week before October 1, and yet  they still launched the web site.  And that is the question we didn't hear  an answer to tonight or this morning.  We didn't hear the answer to that  question, you knew this web site was not ready yet you still launched it on  October 1, why?  </p><p>WILLIS:  There was a great exchange today on that issue of end-to-end  testing.  Why didn't you take the website down, someone suggested, and test  end-to-end, so you can figure out where the problems are.  Fix it, repair  it, get it back up, she said we're not stopping it.  And that the point I  made at the top of the show, which is it seems her message today was, I am  sorry we have problems, I am sorry we have mistakes, issues along the way,  but it doesn't matter.  We're going full steam ahead, right, Tom?</p><p>MILLER:  It was a politically driven operation.  They knew what their  political goals were first, the customers stood well behind that in terms  of priorities, whether it was functional or not, they had to get something  out on October 1.  That drove all of the messiness and incomplete testing  behind it. </p><p>ROY:  People who do software for a living are pulling their hair out,  because they are looking at those kinds of decisions and say, no competent  IT process would eve be run this way.  And this is the most important IT  project in modern history.</p><p>WILLIS:  And it is the most important consumer story, I believe, going on  right now.  Tom and Avik, thank you for being with us.  You'll be back  later.  Appreciate your time. Stay with us.  </p><p>When we come back, the truth behind these so-called glitches from the woman  who helped redesign the WhiteHouse.gov under the Bush administration, she  has great advice coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on the hot  seat, as she battles to rebound from the flawed Obamacare rollout.  So who  exactly is Kathleen Sebelius and what does the future hold for her? We're  back with Avik Roy from the Manhattan Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller.   Welcome back to both of you.  You know, the conversation got heated several  times, and it was funny, she got a little flustered a couple of times.  I  want you to hear this exchange between the secretary and Congressman  Harper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You are saying that the president is not responsible  for HHS?  </p><p>SEBELIUS:  Sir, I didn't say that.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Okay, so the president ultimately is responsible --  while I think it is great you are a team player, and you are taking  responsibility, it is the president's ultimate responsibility, correct?  </p><p>SEBELIUS:  You clearly -- whatever.  Yes, he is the president, he is  responsible for government programs.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  Tom, is it all about accountability here?  Is it all about where  the buck stops?  I think she was trying to say, Sebelius today, that it  stops with me, but I have a sense this was all for show?  </p><p>MILLER:  Well, this is the unaccountable care act, done politically at  least.  Kathleen Sebelius is making a virtue out of her ignorance.  As long  as she can say I don't really know anything about this technology, you  don't have to look any further under the hood.  But she is also there to  serve the president.  She is the heat shield, because if she's not in the  way, people say to the man in the White House, did Bo chew your homework,  or what did you do in terms of administrating the country?  </p><p>WILLIS:  Certainly the spotlight goes back on the president.  Big question  tonight, a lot of people are asking, should she resign?  </p><p>ROY:  The president said last week, it is not just a web site, Obamacare is  not just a web site, it is a whole law that changes the health care system.   Republicans agree.  It's not just a web site.  It is the underlying  architectural law, and if you replace Kathleen Sebelius, the flawed  architectural law would still exist.  So I don't see what that  accomplishes, frankly.</p><p>WILLIS:  Well, she's going to lead this, she's going to take heat, would it  be better to have somebody else in the job?  </p><p>MILLER:  You can't confirm a full-time secretary in this political  environment.  So you lose technically the ability--</p><p>WILLIS:  No way to get that done.  </p><p>MILLER:  You need votes.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Can't get it done--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MILLER:  -- more rounds of hearings about how HHS is run.  </p><p>WILLIS:  So at the end of the day, she is going to keep her job, at least  for the present, and she is going to be in charge of fixing what she has  not been able to put in place for three years.  </p><p>ROY:  And that is why she can say I am responsible for this debacle,  because she's secure in her job, she knows she can take the arrows and she  has the confidence of the president.  But, will she fix it?  She can't, she  is responsible, she is -- the White House and HHS are both responsible for  this mess, because that October 1 launch date, that was the White House's  decision to say we're going to stick to this October 1 launch date, even if  we're not ready, even if everyone tells us we're not ready. </p><p>MILLER:  There is another launch date, which is January 1st, where people  have lost their coverage, and where the exchange coverage begins.  I  believe that the president will carry out a time honored tradition, on  opening day he throws out the first scapegoat, and it might be Kathleen  Sebelius.    </p><p>ROY:  It's kind of like Macbeth.  Macbeth says, well, my hands are  bloodied, so should I just kill everyone else or should I just stop now.   And I think they are at the I'm going to kill everyone else day.</p><p>WILLIS:  You are gleeful in what's going on, which is a tragedy for the  American people.  We were talking earlier in the show about hundreds of  thousands of people losing their coverage tonight.  California, Florida,  all over the country.  Tom, to you, this is playing out in the living rooms  now.  </p><p>ROY:  It's real.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Not just a congressional hearing, that is in fact just a  television set, let's face it, this is a real story.  </p><p>MILLER:  And that is what changes this from I'm going to give you another  speech, I'm going to tell you what is coming, here is what it's going to  be.  Instead it all of a sudden shows up in the daily lives of the average  Americans, even the loss of coverage thing that's due to the grandfathering  rules, it's actually due to a lot of the provisions in the law, which are  literally outlawing coverage, whether or not you are grandfathered.  There  are other requirements in the law which means that these old individual  plans no longer qualify as legitimate plans in the marketplace.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And we've certainly seen a lot of that.  As I was saying, hundreds  of thousands of people losing their coverage, but not everyone wants  coverage in case they get pregnant, or mental health coverage.  </p><p>ROY:  To your point about how this is a living room issue now, the politics  are a lose-lose for the administration.  If they were to shut down the web  site, there would be a temporary humiliation, but the American people would  be better off, the American people would be better off if we delayed this  law, get the web site rebuilt, allow people to have their existing coverage  until the new law is built out.  They don't want to do that, and that is a  real problem, and I think a lot of people will be upset about this.  </p><p>WILLIS:  I think we have to move to a conversation about solutions, because  it is really not enough to say this is not working, we don't like it, we  don't like the president, that's a really -- that's boring, right?  What do  you do to fix it?  </p><p>MILLER:  There are short-term patches, they are difficult though because  the law, the provisions are so interrelated.  You move this over here, you  create a problem somewhere else.  You can change the mandate date, or delay  it, then that affects some of the coverage projections.  So you can expand  the enrollment period, same problem.  So what you probably have got to do,  which we don't have the leverage for, is to say if there is a plan on the  marketplace that you used to buy before, you can keep it, and it can still  be a valid plan.  That is the first step.  You make this a lot less  complex.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Today she said I'm not doing that, we're not going to do that.   We're not going to extend the enrollment period.  You cannot have a 12  month enrollment period.  </p><p>ROY:  There has been a bill introduced by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin,  he has introduced a bill that is also being introduced by Upton in the  Energy and Commerce Committee, to say if you had a plan in 2013 that was  legal, you can keep it in 2014.  And if -- there are a couple of Democrats  in the Senate, Mary Landrieu announced she is in favor of that approach.   So I think you might see something like that get through Congress.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Well, we'll have to wait and see.  I know that secretary of health  and human services does not like it.  Maybe there will be cooler heads that  prevail.  </p><p>MILLER:  Security Sebelius will feel comfortable and secure in her job  until the president says, you are doing a heck of a job, Kathleen.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Thank you for being on, Avik and Tom.  Great job, thanks so much.</p><p>Still to come, my two cents more, and Secretary Sebelius says Obamacare web  site has been miserably frustrating, but it has not crashed.  We'll  separate fact from fiction with the former White House chief information  officer.  You want to see that, coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Countless Americans are struggling to find quality, affordable  health care coverage on the Obamacare web site.  Americans like 62-year-old  David Byron (ph), who last night on our show told us it took days to  navigate all the glitches, and he is now on hold for another 45 days.   Meanwhile, here in Washington, politicians are debating whether the web  site problems are really all that bad.    </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The program has crashed and burned at least three  times, it has been down the whole time you've been testifying, the system  is down at this moment.  </p><p>SEBELIUS:  I would suggest that the web site has never crashed.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  Joining me now Theresa Payton, former White House chief  information officer under President George W. Bush.  She was tasked with  redesigning the WhiteHouse.Gov web site.  Theresa, thank you for joining  us.  I have to ask you, how in the world can you say that this web site has  not crashed?  </p><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORMER WH CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER:  I think this is very  difficult.  You know, a lot of times techies get caught up in the site  didn't crash, it is actually that the site is just slow or a form is not  working.  And in this case, if you think about it, the customer is king  here, and what we learned at the White House is, if they came to the site,  could not get the information they wanted, in their mind it crashed.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Exactly.  I think that is what so many people take away.  And  during the entire hearing, practically, the site was down.  So it was right  there in front of everyone to see.  Shocking, the other big tech question,  everybody was talking about it, was privacy.  I'm sure as you know, there  was a language buried deep in the web site, that said you really can't  trust this site to keep your privacy safe.  Sebelius countered that.  Here  is what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBELIUS:  That is boilerplate language that should not have been in this  particular contract, because there are the highest security standards are  in place, and people have every right to expect privacy.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  So Theresa, she said we are going to get rid of this.  It will not  be on the web site anymore, but does that mean we're safe or does that mean  a line of code they just got rid of?  What does it mean?</p><p>PAYTON:  I think this is more complicated than that.  You are absolutely  right.  And on the first thing, I was glad to hear her say, we have a right  to expect privacy.  So I hope, to get customer confidence back, they will  actually create a privacy policy we can all read and understand.  And it  should be front and center on this web site.  </p><p>The second piece, is even a great privacy and security policy does not mean  that the web site is not hackable.  So, people need to take precautions and  keep that in mind as they are putting information on the web site.  </p><p>WILLIS:  Theresa, isn't it true, I just read this today, they are having  problems with a password reset that is causing an opportunity for hackers  out there, and from I read in the trades, what they are saying is it's not  unusual that there is a problem.  The problem is that they have not found  it yet, and why was it not fixed, why was it not fixed immediately.  What  do you say to that?</p><p>PAYTON:  Well, you know, one thing that I learned in my time at Banking and  at the White House is, time and testing can be your best friend or your  worst enemy.  It sounds like they feel they did not have enough time to  actually test.  </p><p>In this situation, with the password reset, one of the things that we can't  control is some of these bugs in the system.  So a piece of advice I have  for everyone is, there will be other bugs, it could put your data at risk.   So go ahead and get a unique e-mail address that is not attached to your  bank account or the rest of your life, and use that unique e-mail address  just for health care.  That way if the bad guys get in, and get your data,  it is going to be harder for them to take over the rest of your accounts  online. </p><p>WILLIS:  Theresa, that is great advice.  I want to play one more piece of  sound, this is Congressman Rogers asking Sebelius about testing.  Here it  is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Has each piece of that code that has been introduced in  the system been security tested?  </p><p>SEBELIUS:  That is my understanding, yes, sir.    </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Each piece of that code has been tested?  Yes or no.  </p><p>SEBELIUS:  I don't know.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS:  What do you make of that, Theresa?  It sounds like she is confused  about what they've done, what they haven't done.  Were you surprised?  </p><p>PAYTON:  I was a little surprised, because any program manager worth their  weight would make sure there was a good full testing plan.  And there are  automated testing tools, it does not just require bodies these days.  You  can actually program testing tools to test all kinds of scenarios.  So I  think one of the questions that needs to be asked, is how do you answer the  testing questions to the satisfaction for the security team, and do we have  data in grave danger of either being corrupted or stolen?  I think that is  a key question that needs to be answered.  </p><p>WILLIS:  And not answered yet.  So many questions, so few answers on the  technical difficulties with the web site.  Theresa, thanks for coming in  tonight and chatting with us about it.  We appreciate your time.  </p><p>PAYTON:  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>WILLIS:  We'll be right back with my two cents more and the answer to the  question of the day, do you buy Sebelius' apology?  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WILLIS:  Finally tonight, kudos to Kathleen Sebelius for admitting her role  in the debacle that is the Obamacare web site.  But now to the people's  problem, since the site does not work and people cannot get on the site to  fulfill the requirements of the law, why wouldn't we delay the mandate  further?  When the administration can't get the centerpiece of its key  program working in the middle of a congressional hearing on its lack of  competency, well, that is a sign that continuing to push forward makes no  sense.  But the administration is not waiting.  Sorry we screwed up, but  there will be no delays in the mandate.  Apology for the mistake, but  you'll still face penalties if you do not apply.  We're taking  responsibility for our screwups, but we are forging ahead anyway, sorry.</p><p>I'm reminded what the secretary muttered under her breath as the  congressman began to ask her why she had not applied for coverage -- don't  do this to me, she said.  Indeed, don't do this to us.  That's my two cents  more.  And that's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT.  Thanks for joining us.   We'll see you right here.  Well, not right here, but in New York tomorrow.   Have a good night.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2013 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight on a special edition of THE WILLIS REPORT, live from Washington, D.C., hey it's sorry but nothing is changing. That's the takeaway from Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee on the Obamacare website mess today. She's apologizing but not rolling back on deadlines. Americans will still have to pay fines if they don't play along with the White House's tune.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here to weigh in, Doug Holtz-Eakin, president of the American Action Form and Republican congressman Bill Johnson of Ohio who is at the hearing today. Doug, I'm going to start with you. We got an apology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DOUG HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM PRESIDENT: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Obviously - were you satisfied with what you heard?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Well, I thought the secretary did a good job, quite frankly. She had the right demeanor. I thought the apology rang true. And she did her job in that she answered the question she wanted to answer and she didn't answer the ones that they did not want her to talk about.</p><p>WILLIS: It was a lot that didn't get answered today. We will hit on some of that. But you know, this got testy testing many, many times. And Sebelius telling <person><nameText>Marsha Blackburn </nameText></person>the congresswoman to hold her accountable. Even that was testy. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. <person><nameText>MARSHA BLACKBURN </nameText></person>(R), TENNESSEE: Who is in charge, madam secretary?</p><p><person><nameText>KATHLEEN SEBELIUS, </nameText></person>HHS SECRETARY: The person now in charge as an integrator is QSSI, one of our -</p><p>BLACKBURN: Who was in charge?</p><p>SEBELIUS: -- was in charge -</p><p>BLACKBURN: AT that team who is the individual -</p><p>SEBELIUS: Michele Snyder.</p><p>BLACKBURN: Michele Snyder is the one responsible for this debacle.</p><p>SEBELIUS: Well, excuse me, congresswoman, Michele Snyder is not responsible for the debacle, hold me accountable for the debacle. I'm responsible.</p><p>BLACKBURN: OK.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: I'm responsible. You just heard that from the secretary of Health and Human Services.</p><p>Congressman, if she's accountable, why does she still have the job?</p><p>REP. BILL JOHNSON (R), OHIO: Well, that's a good question. You know, <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>serves at the pleasure of the president, as does the lady that she said was in charge. If that's the kind of performance that they are willing to tolerate, I can tell you my experience as a program manager, I would not have had a job if I had performed like this.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, I think in the private sector nobody understands what's going on. I tell you in New York we are all mystified. But here in Washington, different rules apply. Here is my big question. And my take away from the whole thing today. She seemed to be saying, \"We are sorry. We are sorry. We really didn't mean it. We apologize,\" but at the same time, you are getting no brakes. We might have screwed up but you're getting no delay in deadlines, you're still going to have to pay penalties. It's all on you. Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: That's exactly right. Remember, the president said, \"This is more than a website,\" and they believe that deeply. They want the policies, they want the whole agenda, and they believe that they can get people to the polls one way or another. They've done it before. They think about it like a political campaign and they're going to try to get in there one way or another.</p><p>WILLIS: Congressman, you're an expert in IT. You've spent part of your career and IT, certainly in school in IT, you've studied it. Is <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>the right person to run what is a massive e-commerce website?</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, apparently not because many, many mistakes were made. You know, I've looked through the contracts. I've seen the testing that was required to be performed under that contract. We know now that integration testing didn't even begin until two weeks prior to going live. They were supposed to do a full suite of testing, part of a pre-operational readiness review back in the fourth quarter of 2012 and then a final review with test results, test analysis, and all of that in the first quarter of 2013. And I can't find anyone there that will tell me whether that has occurred or not.</p><p>WILLIS: What grade do you give them? (INAUDIBLE) somebody who knows how well it done.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well, it's failed. It is absolutely an F. That's the grade they give.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. I want you to hear some more - this is from Congressman Mike Rogers questioning Sebelius on this very issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MIKE ROGERS: You accepted a risk on behalf of every user of this computer that put their personal financial information at risk because you did not even have the most basic end-to-end test for security of the system. Amazon would never do this. Pro Flowers would never do this. Kayak would never do this.</p><p>I will commit today secretary to shut down the system and do an end to end security test so that these Americans -</p><p>SEBELIUS: No, sir.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: All right. So if you heard the tail end of that, what she said is no. We are not shutting it down. We're not shutting it down for an end to end test even though that that may be the only way to find out what is wrong. Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: This was a bull's-eye. This is a deep concern to the American public. The privacy of their personal information is paramounts. They played politics with this schedule. They played politics with the policy. But you can't play politics with people's privacy. That is going to hurt and then you can worry about it.</p><p>WILLIS: Or your health care, in my view. I think that is why people are so upset. This policy is right up in people's grill. It's about how much health care you get, what you're going to pay for it, what the quality of your life is really going to be like.</p><p>Congressman, to you. I was amused to hear that the federal chief information officer today said, \"What we have been through is a teachable moment.\" What do you make of that?</p><p>JOHNSON: A teachable moment?</p><p>WILLIS: A teachable moment.</p><p>JOHNSON: I would like to have him in my class because I have a few things that I would like to teach. You just don't get this far into an implementation with these many problems and think that you're going to be able to fix it. They may create a perception that it is being fixed, but I submit that it is going to cost millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars more to repair and replace this system than to simply fix it. It is badly, badly broken.</p><p>WILLIS: We are still waiting on those numbers. We don't really know those numbers, how much it costs, how much of the taxpayer money were sunk into this.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Right. The transparency is terrible. For an administration that publicly prides itself on transparency, you can't find out anything in this process. I think there are too big lessons that are going to play in the debate for a long time.</p><p>There is a generation of Americans who believed the president when he said that government solves problems. The government is an active force in your life. But they didn't understand government fails. And fails a lot. This is a massive failure. They're learning that lesson. They also will learn that this - the private sector succeeds because there is a financial incentive to make trades, make transactions. Why does the New York Stock Exchange work? That exchange works for a reason. So does the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, so does Amazon, so does Ebay. That is a lesson as well.</p><p>JOHNSON: Gerri, the biggest concern that I've got right now is what he said. You know, it's easy to spend somebody else's money when it's not coming out of your pocket. I mean the American taxpayers have already paid for this system one time. And it was badly flawed.</p><p>Now they're being asked to pay for it again because this new systems integrator, that was supposed to be independent, QSSI, that was part of the development team and part of the independent (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: In the first place.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: In the first place.</p><p>JOHNSON: Is now going to be paid more to try and rescue this system. I want to know how they're going to recover the money and pay for this thing without taking (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: One of the scariest words in the English language. I'm from the government (INAUDIBLE). Guys, thanks for helping me out tonight. You did a great job. Thanks, congressman.</p><p>Jonathan, Doug will be with us after the break.</p><p>But first we want to know what you think. Here is our question tonight - do you buy Sebelius' apology? Log on to gerriwillis.com. Vote on the right hand side of the screen. I will show the results at the end of tonight's show. We got more and more to come. From Washington D.C., this hour, including calls for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to throw in the towel.</p><p>And next, more on the lies and broken promises of this law, especially the one we got to keep your insurance plan. Remember that. Senator John Barrasso is here after the break. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: Time and time again the president campaigning on this promise to the American people in his push for Obamacare.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: If you like your doctor you will be able to keep her doctor. Period. If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: A promise broken hundreds of thousands, if not millions of times over as more insurance cancellations keep people - keep these pouring into the mailbox.</p><p>We're live in D.C. bringing you the very latest on the Obamacare fiasco. Back with me now, Doug Holtz-Eakin from the American Action Forum. And joining us to is Republican Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming.</p><p>Senator, I will start with you. You know, we have been talking about this broken promise. Essentially Democrats have said, you can't complain about the law. It's the law of the land. But if it was sold on bad information, what does that mean?</p><p>SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), TENNESSEE: Well, I think the president intentionally had these lines designed to deceive the American people. So they could force through of party-line vote a health care law that I think is bad for patients as well as doctors and nurses who take care of them as well as the taxpayers this - the problems with the website are only the tip of the iceberg. The law itself is fatally flawed in terms of keeping your doctor, in terms of all of these cancellations of policies. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: I'm going to show some numbers on that right now because we have been running a tally on the cancellations. I've got something like - 1.7 million. If you add up all these numbers from all over the country, we're seeing hundreds of thousands of people getting cancellations every day.</p><p>And in the testimony today, Sebelius was saying those aren't cancellations. If they're not cancellations , what are they?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They are cancellations, and there are more to come. Because there are more and more of these so-called grandfather plans where they will have to make enough changes to comply with the law that they'll be canceled. They're no longer legal for sale and that's that and it's because the law (INAUDIBLE) on that front.</p><p>BARRASSO: And the regulations that they wrote afterwards because you have a tower of regulations that's going to be tall. They've really got very restrictive in the regulations when the president said \"If you like your insurance, you can keep your insurance.\" It really only if the White House likes your insurance.</p><p>WILLIS: That's right.</p><p>BARRASSO: You can keep your insurance. And if the White House doesn't like your insurance you can keep it.</p><p>WILLIS: Essential health benefits. I want you to hear from Cory Gardner. He's a congressman who got up in today's hearing and said \"Here's my cancellation notice. I just got it.\" Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. CORY GARDNER (R), COLORADO: This is the letter that my family got canceling our insurance. We chose to have our just have our own private policy back in Colorado so we could be in the same boat as every one of my constituents, and yet my insurance policy has been canceled. The White House website says if you like your health plan you can keep it. Did I hear it wrong?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: So you hear the congressman say he has lost his health insurance. He's very upset. He went on to say to <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>\"I think you should be enrolled in Obamacare. Why aren't you enrolled in Obamacare?\" What did you make of that exchange?</p><p>BARRASSO: Well, I think that every employee in the White House ought to be involved and enrolled in the Obama health care law and (INAUDIBLE) to buy insurance on the exchanges. None of them - they all have exemptions from this health care law. I think they all should be involved. But he is right, and it is not just people losing their coverage but then they have to go and buy insurance, they're getting hit with sticker shock, Gerri, because they are seeing it's turning out to be a lot more expensive.</p><p>Remember, the president promised easier to use than Amazon, the website, cheaper than your cellphone bill, and you can keep your doctor. And the American people feel deceived by the lines of the president.</p><p>WILLIS: Exactly.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: And that is really important. Because the way they tried to keep prices down and there's a lot of sticker shock already, is to have tight networks. That means you probably won't get to see your doctor or go to the usual hospital.</p><p>WILLIS: I think we are all headed for RNs, I think at the end of the day. I want you to hear something from Congressman Lee Terry. Because another issue for me has been when are we going to get details, when are we going to know, understand how many people are being enrolled? It's an open question. Here is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. LEE TERRY (R), NEBRASKA: That should be a pretty reliable number.</p><p>SEBELIUS: The system is not functioning. So we are not getting that reliable data.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: So the secretary says essentially we don't know because we are not getting reliable data. Doug.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I find this the least believable in a long list of things that are believable.</p><p>WILLIS: That's not true.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Pick up the phone. Insurance companies in America know who they have signed up. If they have completed a contract with somebody, it has gone down to the billed out for premiums and they're going to know. Ask the insurers. How many have you signed up. How many have you signed up? Add (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>WILLIS: I don't think the insurers have good information either.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They may not have the right information about who they signed up but they're going to know how many people have made it through the process. They have to.</p><p>BARRASSO: And our insurance commissioner in the state of Wyoming, he has tried to log on to the website every day since October 1st, has not gotten through as of this past week. Lisa Markowsky, the senator from Alaska told a number of us today that they made the calls. There are three people in the state of Alaska who have been able to sign up.</p><p>WILLIS: Let me tell you, one thing that was almost missed in the coverage today because we weren't in the room. We're watching it on TV. They have a video up of the website. It was not available. You couldn't sign on during that very congressional hearing that is investigating why this website is not up. This is like prime time for the administration. If you are able to get this website to work, it would be during this congressional hearing. It did not happen.</p><p>BARRASSO: And if you're ever going to try to convince young healthy individuals to sign up, they are losing this (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARRASSO: These are the people that have to sign up for the financing of the whole program to work. They're depending on 2.7 million young people to pay more for more insurance than they need to pay for older, sicker people.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>BARRASSO: And that is what this whole thing is built upon.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: They touted some numbers. You heard the president, for example, say more than 60,000 people.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Those are all Medicaid recipients. Those are not people - the Oregon exchange has not yet opened. And so they are also not being clear about who is in what category. It will have a very, very, very (INAUDIBLE) rollout.</p><p>WILLIS: If you have to guess the proportion of people who are signing up now, who are actually on Medicaid rather than Obamacare, what would it be?</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: I guess 90 percent.</p><p>WILLIS: We're going to have to leave it there. Senator, Doug, thanks for being with us. Great job. Fascinating conversation. Really appreciate your time.</p><p>HOLTZ-EAKIN: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: And later in the show, hear what President Obama had to say following his secretary's testimony.</p><p>Next, despite getting some praise for performance today many in Congress are calling for Sebelius to be fired, and one of those senators, Lamar Alexander, joins me next. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: The top Republican on the Senate's health panel calling for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to quit. His reaction to her testimony, next.</p><p>WILLIS: With the unsuccessful rollout of the Obamacare website, many lawmakers have been calling for Health and Human Services secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to resign, adding to that, chorus of calls is the ranking member on the Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Earlier today, I spoke with him and asked him if he was satisfied with what he heard today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEN. LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), TENNESSEE: I'm not satisfied. She should step down. I mean, this is the private sector, that kind of performance would not be tolerated. And she should step down and somebody else should take charge.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, she said she was sorry. She said she regretted it. She says she's working on all the problems. Why isn't that good enough?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, it's not good enough. You know, Admiral Rickover created our nuclear navy and told the captains of the submarines, \"Look, you are in charge of the reactor, too. There is ever a problem with the reactor, your career is over.\" And so we never had a problem with the reactors. That's what we need here. We need accountability. Even in their public sector, we need accountability.</p><p>WILLIS: Accountability, a big theme with you. You know, you called for her resignation. You're not backing off right now. Interesting. You've asked for documents though and what you want is a weekly report.</p><p>ALEXANDER: Sure.</p><p>WILLIS: What do you want to see?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, we want to know how many people have tried through the exchange to buy Obamacare, how many succeeded, in what zip code do they live, what level of insurance did they buy. We need to know that. We ought to know it every week. You know, before the internet age RCA knew how many records Elvis was selling every day. I mean, Ford knew how many cars it was selling every day. McDonald's could tell you how many hamburgers they're selling every day.</p><p>Now we're in the middle of the internet age, the Obama administration should be able to tell us every day how many people are signing up. What are they buying?</p><p>WILLIS: Doesn't the problems with the website tell you just how dramatic this is. She seems to be saying \"We can't tell you. We don't know. We don't have the information.\" Do you buy that?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, if they don't know it is worse than I even think. The important thing is the website is not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is going to be the canceled premiums, the millions of Americans who are going to find on January 1 that the premiums that the president said they could keep are being canceled because they are not legal under Obamacare. These businesses are going to be finding that the costs are so high they're going to drop a lot of their coverage and their employees are going into Medicaid, and businesses are also struggling because of the 30- hour work week requirement. They're going to have to cut pay, in fact, by putting employees on 30-hour work weeks to avoid the Obamacare requirement.</p><p>WILLIS: What do you mean these premiums aren't legal?</p><p>ALEXANDER: What I mean is that under Obamacare only some insurance policies are legal. You may have an insurance policy with say a high deductible that you can afford and you like. The Obamacare may say that is as good enough for you, therefore that policy cannot be issued by an insurance company after January 1. So your policy is gone. So you then have to go on an exchange through a website that doesn't work to buy insurance or you will be fined by the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p>WILLIS: Senator, that is an issue we have been talking a lot about this week. Hundreds of thousands of people already seeing their policies canceled, and for that very reason they don't meet the requirements of the Obama administration.</p><p>ALEXANDER: That's more than hundreds of thousands. I mean, just in California, Florida, and New Jersey. We've counted up at least a million and a half Americans whose policies will be cancelled on January 1 which is about 10 times the number of people who applied for insurance in just those three states.</p><p>WILLIS: Astonishing fast. And as we look forward, one of the things we are hearing is that the costs are a big debate. We don't know how much this thing is costing us. Here's what Sebelius had to say today about what she has paid out for this website. Listen to this -</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BLACKBURN: Can you give me a ballpark of what you have spent on this website that does not work, that individuals can not get to. What is your cost estimate?</p><p>SEBELIUS: So far, Congresswoman, we have spent about $118 million on the website itself and about $56 million has been expended on other IT to support the web.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: So that's $174 million. In last week's testimony, the IT contractors themselves say they spent nearly 500 million. So who is right? What's the real number?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, I don't know. I've heard 400. But the fact is, this is the president's signature achievement. He has had three and half years to do it. I used to be a governor, that's smaller potatoes. But on something that is important to me, I put somebody in charge. I'll be with him every week or every month and say is it on budget. Is it getting done? And if it's not I'll get somebody else to do it. I don't know how why the president has not been doing that.</p><p>WILLIS: One final question, a couple of weeks ago, February 2010, you told the president \"if you put this program in place you're going to raise people's premiums and it's going to cause people more money.\" He said, \"You didn't have the facts straight.\" What is the reality?</p><p>ALEXANDER: Well, the reality was then I was right and today I am proven right because I said, \"Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office has said that individual premiums are going to go up under your claim. You don't know the facts.\" It turns out today individual premiums and there are 19 million Americans who have those, are seeing premium increases of maybe 50 percent to 100 percent.</p><p>WILLIS: But a long way to go. Senator, thanks for coming on the show tonight.</p><p>ALEXANDER: Thank you.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILLIS: Coming up, the calls for <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>to step down grow louder. Is the face of Obamacare ready to do that.</p><p>Next, this secretary isn't the only White House official in front of a camera today. The president also offering his take.</p><p>Our Rich Edson have the latest after the break.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: Live from Washington D.C., here again is Gerri Willis.</p><p>WILLIS: Welcome back to a special edition of \"The Willis Report.\" We are live from our nation's capital. President Obama skipping out of town to sell his signature policy in Boston. The president eagerly trying to compare Massachusetts health care law's low start to Obamacare's, Fox Business' Rich Edson have the latest.</p><p>Rich, did the president comment on people losing their coverage?</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: He did, Gerri, and it has become the primary criticism of the law this week, even overshadowing the botched rollout of healthcare.gov. President Obama said if Americans liked their substandard plans, they could have kept them. As for those who have seen their plans disappear, the president blamed insurance companies for canceling those policies. He then encourages Americans to find better Obamacare insurance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: If you are getting one of these letters, just shop around in the new marketplace. That is what it's for. Because of the tax credits that we're offering and the competition between insurers, most people are going to be able to get better comprehensive health care plans for the same price or even cheaper than projected. You are going to get a better deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Republicans say that the president lied when he was selling the proposal and that Americans largely cannot keep their cheaper, bare-bones insurance plans. The health care law was designed to phase out those policies, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: Rich, thank you. We appreciate your time.</p><p><person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>sat in front of the House panel for three and a half long hours today, facing some tough questions. So what are the key takeaways? Let's get to it, joining me now, Avik Roy, senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller. He is author of \"Why Obamacare is Wrong for America.\" Avik, I will start with you. You were in the hearing, what did you make of it?</p><p>AVIK ROY, MANHATTAN INST.: I thought it was substantive. I thought there was a lot less of the grandstanding that you normally see at these kinds of hearings, but I think what I was struck by most of all was the depth and the scope and the breadth of the problems with the exchanges.</p><p>WILLIS: They were all over the place, it was everything from technical glitches to people losing their coverage. It was--</p><p>ROY: Front end, back-end, verifying with the IRS, the security and the privacy stuff that Congressman Rogers talked about that you played the clip of. It was just all over the place, and I look at this and I say, it is going to be a lot harder to fix this than I think a lot of people think.</p><p>WILLIS: I guess the problems are just starting, Tom. What did you make of the hearing?</p><p>TOM MILLER, AEI: What is coming out more and more is that problems with Obamacare are features, not bugs, it's not just a matter of technical incompetence. We've had plenty of that, but you start with the inability of people to access the site, but then we are learning about these other concerns, that the prices are a big problem for people, people are losing their plans, security and privacy are real concerns. There has been misleading information out on the web site, telling people between the ages of 27 and 50, here is the standard price for everyone, even though it's going to vary, same thing for 50 and above. All of these reflect that this was designed in a way different than what was sold to the American public. The president said you can keep your plan period, he forgot to say there was a semicolon. He had a few extra clauses which said there are other conditions on that one.</p><p>WILLIS: That is right. One of the things that nobody's talking about and really fascinates me, I don't feel that we really know <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>she is sort of a black box for a lot of us. We know she is not from around here. We know her dad was John Gilligan, who invented the state income tax, but beyond that, who is this woman running our health care?</p><p>ROY: I have written a lot about <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>at my Forbes column and National Review, over the years, monitoring all the implementation of Obamacare, and what I can tell you is that she is arguably the most partisan operator at the cabinet level in the Obama administration. She has been very willing to change a lot of the things about the way that law is implemented, in order to maximize the political advantage of the administration. They postponed a lot of regulations dealing with the exchanges until after the election.</p><p>WILLIS: What about changing the shopping feature, that was politically motivated, Tom?</p><p>MILLER: And it came in just the last couple of weeks. They will try to throw the private contractors under the bus. They can't go too far or the private contractors will start revealing some private memos, which will not look very good. But that was a clear turnoff to keep people from knowing what the real prices were in order to induce them into the exchange and getting them--</p><p>WILLIS: One of the things people don't talk about, she is an old insurance commissioner, and that is often the job of someone who is very political, and somebody who really wants to hold the industry's feet to the fire.</p><p>MILLER: She believed in regulation as the insurance commissioner in Kansas. We think of Kansas as this deeply conservative state. She was on the other side of the divided both as the insurance commissioner and as the governor. So she is not only a second-hand manager, she is a believer in this. And a direct (inaudible).</p><p>WILLIS: You could hear in her voice, her commitment to this idea that everyone should get health care, that this is a national right. Is this a national right?</p><p>ROY: It is a particular kind of healthcare. Her view is that insurance means you have to be covered for every single thing, whereas normally in the business world, we think of insurance as you get hit by a bus, you have a stroke, you are covered. She thinks of insurance as everything should be paid for -- birth control, your allergy pills.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Someone said to me, while we had all these conversations, for so many months on Obamacare, if you wanted to get auto insurance, would you expect to go on the web and not tell anybody anything at all about your driving history? No, you would not, that would never happen, Tom, but that is exactly what is happening with Obamacare.</p><p>MILLER: Well, we passed the law without knowing what was in it. Now we have coverage where after you enroll, maybe you'll find out what's in it.</p><p>WILLIS: Absolutely right. Avik?</p><p>ROY: One of the things that is really important to understand about the architects of the law is they knew, they knew the web site was not ready, they knew eight months ago the web site wasn't ready. They only did the first end-to-end test of the web site one week before October 1, and yet they still launched the web site. And that is the question we didn't hear an answer to tonight or this morning. We didn't hear the answer to that question, you knew this web site was not ready yet you still launched it on October 1, why?</p><p>WILLIS: There was a great exchange today on that issue of end-to-end testing. Why didn't you take the website down, someone suggested, and test end-to-end, so you can figure out where the problems are. Fix it, repair it, get it back up, she said we're not stopping it. And that the point I made at the top of the show, which is it seems her message today was, I am sorry we have problems, I am sorry we have mistakes, issues along the way, but it doesn't matter. We're going full steam ahead, right, Tom?</p><p>MILLER: It was a politically driven operation. They knew what their political goals were first, the customers stood well behind that in terms of priorities, whether it was functional or not, they had to get something out on October 1. That drove all of the messiness and incomplete testing behind it.</p><p>ROY: People who do software for a living are pulling their hair out, because they are looking at those kinds of decisions and say, no competent IT process would eve be run this way. And this is the most important IT project in modern history.</p><p>WILLIS: And it is the most important consumer story, I believe, going on right now. Tom and Avik, thank you for being with us. You'll be back later. Appreciate your time. Stay with us.</p><p>When we come back, the truth behind these so-called glitches from the woman who helped redesign the WhiteHouse.gov under the Bush administration, she has great advice coming up.</p><p>WILLIS: Health and Human Services Secretary <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>on the hot seat, as she battles to rebound from the flawed Obamacare rollout. So who exactly is <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>and what does the future hold for her? We're back with Avik Roy from the Manhattan Institute and AEI scholar Tom Miller. Welcome back to both of you. You know, the conversation got heated several times, and it was funny, she got a little flustered a couple of times. I want you to hear this exchange between the secretary and Congressman Harper.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You are saying that the president is not responsible for HHS?</p><p>SEBELIUS: Sir, I didn't say that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Okay, so the president ultimately is responsible -- while I think it is great you are a team player, and you are taking responsibility, it is the president's ultimate responsibility, correct?</p><p>SEBELIUS: You clearly -- whatever. Yes, he is the president, he is responsible for government programs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Tom, is it all about accountability here? Is it all about where the buck stops? I think she was trying to say, Sebelius today, that it stops with me, but I have a sense this was all for show?</p><p>MILLER: Well, this is the unaccountable care act, done politically at least. <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>is making a virtue out of her ignorance. As long as she can say I don't really know anything about this technology, you don't have to look any further under the hood. But she is also there to serve the president. She is the heat shield, because if she's not in the way, people say to the man in the White House, did Bo chew your homework, or what did you do in terms of administrating the country?</p><p>WILLIS: Certainly the spotlight goes back on the president. Big question tonight, a lot of people are asking, should she resign?</p><p>ROY: The president said last week, it is not just a web site, Obamacare is not just a web site, it is a whole law that changes the health care system. Republicans agree. It's not just a web site. It is the underlying architectural law, and if you replace <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius, </nameText></person>the flawed architectural law would still exist. So I don't see what that accomplishes, frankly.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, she's going to lead this, she's going to take heat, would it be better to have somebody else in the job?</p><p>MILLER: You can't confirm a full-time secretary in this political environment. So you lose technically the ability--</p><p>WILLIS: No way to get that done.</p><p>MILLER: You need votes.</p><p>WILLIS: Can't get it done--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MILLER: -- more rounds of hearings about how HHS is run.</p><p>WILLIS: So at the end of the day, she is going to keep her job, at least for the present, and she is going to be in charge of fixing what she has not been able to put in place for three years.</p><p>ROY: And that is why she can say I am responsible for this debacle, because she's secure in her job, she knows she can take the arrows and she has the confidence of the president. But, will she fix it? She can't, she is responsible, she is -- the White House and HHS are both responsible for this mess, because that October 1 launch date, that was the White House's decision to say we're going to stick to this October 1 launch date, even if we're not ready, even if everyone tells us we're not ready.</p><p>MILLER: There is another launch date, which is January 1st, where people have lost their coverage, and where the exchange coverage begins. I believe that the president will carry out a time honored tradition, on opening day he throws out the first scapegoat, and it might be <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius.</nameText></person></p><p>ROY: It's kind of like Macbeth. Macbeth says, well, my hands are bloodied, so should I just kill everyone else or should I just stop now. And I think they are at the I'm going to kill everyone else day.</p><p>WILLIS: You are gleeful in what's going on, which is a tragedy for the American people. We were talking earlier in the show about hundreds of thousands of people losing their coverage tonight. California, Florida, all over the country. Tom, to you, this is playing out in the living rooms now.</p><p>ROY: It's real.</p><p>WILLIS: Not just a congressional hearing, that is in fact just a television set, let's face it, this is a real story.</p><p>MILLER: And that is what changes this from I'm going to give you another speech, I'm going to tell you what is coming, here is what it's going to be. Instead it all of a sudden shows up in the daily lives of the average Americans, even the loss of coverage thing that's due to the grandfathering rules, it's actually due to a lot of the provisions in the law, which are literally outlawing coverage, whether or not you are grandfathered. There are other requirements in the law which means that these old individual plans no longer qualify as legitimate plans in the marketplace.</p><p>WILLIS: And we've certainly seen a lot of that. As I was saying, hundreds of thousands of people losing their coverage, but not everyone wants coverage in case they get pregnant, or mental health coverage.</p><p>ROY: To your point about how this is a living room issue now, the politics are a lose-lose for the administration. If they were to shut down the web site, there would be a temporary humiliation, but the American people would be better off, the American people would be better off if we delayed this law, get the web site rebuilt, allow people to have their existing coverage until the new law is built out. They don't want to do that, and that is a real problem, and I think a lot of people will be upset about this.</p><p>WILLIS: I think we have to move to a conversation about solutions, because it is really not enough to say this is not working, we don't like it, we don't like the president, that's a really -- that's boring, right? What do you do to fix it?</p><p>MILLER: There are short-term patches, they are difficult though because the law, the provisions are so interrelated. You move this over here, you create a problem somewhere else. You can change the mandate date, or delay it, then that affects some of the coverage projections. So you can expand the enrollment period, same problem. So what you probably have got to do, which we don't have the leverage for, is to say if there is a plan on the marketplace that you used to buy before, you can keep it, and it can still be a valid plan. That is the first step. You make this a lot less complex.</p><p>WILLIS: Today she said I'm not doing that, we're not going to do that. We're not going to extend the enrollment period. You cannot have a 12 month enrollment period.</p><p>ROY: There has been a bill introduced by Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, he has introduced a bill that is also being introduced by Upton in the Energy and Commerce Committee, to say if you had a plan in 2013 that was legal, you can keep it in 2014. And if -- there are a couple of Democrats in the Senate, Mary Landrieu announced she is in favor of that approach. So I think you might see something like that get through Congress.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, we'll have to wait and see. I know that secretary of health and human services does not like it. Maybe there will be cooler heads that prevail.</p><p>MILLER: Security Sebelius will feel comfortable and secure in her job until the president says, you are doing a heck of a job, Kathleen.</p><p>WILLIS: Thank you for being on, Avik and Tom. Great job, thanks so much.</p><p>Still to come, my two cents more, and Secretary Sebelius says Obamacare web site has been miserably frustrating, but it has not crashed. We'll separate fact from fiction with the former White House chief information officer. You want to see that, coming up.</p><p>WILLIS: Countless Americans are struggling to find quality, affordable health care coverage on the Obamacare web site. Americans like 62-year-old David Byron (ph), who last night on our show told us it took days to navigate all the glitches, and he is now on hold for another 45 days. Meanwhile, here in Washington, politicians are debating whether the web site problems are really all that bad.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The program has crashed and burned at least three times, it has been down the whole time you've been testifying, the system is down at this moment.</p><p>SEBELIUS: I would suggest that the web site has never crashed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Joining me now Theresa Payton, former White House chief information officer under President George W. Bush. She was tasked with redesigning the WhiteHouse.Gov web site. Theresa, thank you for joining us. I have to ask you, how in the world can you say that this web site has not crashed?</p><p>THERESA PAYTON, FORMER WH CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER: I think this is very difficult. You know, a lot of times techies get caught up in the site didn't crash, it is actually that the site is just slow or a form is not working. And in this case, if you think about it, the customer is king here, and what we learned at the White House is, if they came to the site, could not get the information they wanted, in their mind it crashed.</p><p>WILLIS: Exactly. I think that is what so many people take away. And during the entire hearing, practically, the site was down. So it was right there in front of everyone to see. Shocking, the other big tech question, everybody was talking about it, was privacy. I'm sure as you know, there was a language buried deep in the web site, that said you really can't trust this site to keep your privacy safe. Sebelius countered that. Here is what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBELIUS: That is boilerplate language that should not have been in this particular contract, because there are the highest security standards are in place, and people have every right to expect privacy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: So Theresa, she said we are going to get rid of this. It will not be on the web site anymore, but does that mean we're safe or does that mean a line of code they just got rid of? What does it mean?</p><p>PAYTON: I think this is more complicated than that. You are absolutely right. And on the first thing, I was glad to hear her say, we have a right to expect privacy. So I hope, to get customer confidence back, they will actually create a privacy policy we can all read and understand. And it should be front and center on this web site.</p><p>The second piece, is even a great privacy and security policy does not mean that the web site is not hackable. So, people need to take precautions and keep that in mind as they are putting information on the web site.</p><p>WILLIS: Theresa, isn't it true, I just read this today, they are having problems with a password reset that is causing an opportunity for hackers out there, and from I read in the trades, what they are saying is it's not unusual that there is a problem. The problem is that they have not found it yet, and why was it not fixed, why was it not fixed immediately. What do you say to that?</p><p>PAYTON: Well, you know, one thing that I learned in my time at Banking and at the White House is, time and testing can be your best friend or your worst enemy. It sounds like they feel they did not have enough time to actually test.</p><p>In this situation, with the password reset, one of the things that we can't control is some of these bugs in the system. So a piece of advice I have for everyone is, there will be other bugs, it could put your data at risk. So go ahead and get a unique e-mail address that is not attached to your bank account or the rest of your life, and use that unique e-mail address just for health care. That way if the bad guys get in, and get your data, it is going to be harder for them to take over the rest of your accounts online.</p><p>WILLIS: Theresa, that is great advice. I want to play one more piece of sound, this is Congressman Rogers asking Sebelius about testing. Here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Has each piece of that code that has been introduced in the system been security tested?</p><p>SEBELIUS: That is my understanding, yes, sir.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Each piece of that code has been tested? Yes or no.</p><p>SEBELIUS: I don't know.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: What do you make of that, Theresa? It sounds like she is confused about what they've done, what they haven't done. Were you surprised?</p><p>PAYTON: I was a little surprised, because any program manager worth their weight would make sure there was a good full testing plan. And there are automated testing tools, it does not just require bodies these days. You can actually program testing tools to test all kinds of scenarios. So I think one of the questions that needs to be asked, is how do you answer the testing questions to the satisfaction for the security team, and do we have data in grave danger of either being corrupted or stolen? I think that is a key question that needs to be answered.</p><p>WILLIS: And not answered yet. So many questions, so few answers on the technical difficulties with the web site. Theresa, thanks for coming in tonight and chatting with us about it. We appreciate your time.</p><p>PAYTON: Thanks for having me.</p><p>WILLIS: We'll be right back with my two cents more and the answer to the question of the day, do you buy Sebelius' apology? Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: Finally tonight, kudos to <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>for admitting her role in the debacle that is the Obamacare web site. But now to the people's problem, since the site does not work and people cannot get on the site to fulfill the requirements of the law, why wouldn't we delay the mandate further? When the administration can't get the centerpiece of its key program working in the middle of a congressional hearing on its lack of competency, well, that is a sign that continuing to push forward makes no sense. But the administration is not waiting. Sorry we screwed up, but there will be no delays in the mandate. Apology for the mistake, but you'll still face penalties if you do not apply. We're taking responsibility for our screwups, but we are forging ahead anyway, sorry.</p><p>I'm reminded what the secretary muttered under her breath as the congressman began to ask her why she had not applied for coverage -- don't do this to me, she said. Indeed, don't do this to us. That's my two cents more. And that's it for tonight's WILLIS REPORT. Thanks for joining us. We'll see you right here. Well, not right here, but in New York tomorrow. Have a good night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLSRPT-2013103001cb222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLSRPT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59PV-J6X1-DXH2-64YM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>The Willis Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>October 30, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Meetings</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Medicare and Medicaid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internet</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policies</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legislation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

We are on the frontlines of a long overdue national change, fixing a broken health system. Now this is the most meaningful work I've ever been a part of. In fact, it's been the cause of my life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>NEIL CAVUTO, FBN HOST</nameText></person>: Well, not anymore. Because Sebelius is out and look who's coming in. Welcome everybody. I'm <person><nameText>Neil Cavuto. </nameText></person>And maybe Republicans should stop high fiving each other over this <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>resignation over at HHS.</p><p>And take a gander at who is quickly filling the void for HHS, not the woman yet to be confirmed there but the folks already up and running at the IRS. Yes, the IRS. It's true and it is kind of frightening because the Internal Revenue Service now it's carte blanche to kind of do anything. Are you surprised?</p><p>Don't be. The IRS is already knee deep in this healthcare thing. Policing it, hiring agents to enforce it, monitoring virtually all financing aspects of it. Yes, the taxman, better known to conservatives are targeting them, now the default go to healthcare law enforcers, monitoring us, all of us. So talk about taxing and talk about out of the frying pan and into another federal agency fire. Maybe a worse one.</p><p>To former <person><nameText>Governor Mike Huckabee, </nameText></person>former Health &amp; Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson on why this gap could be an even bigger slap. <person><nameText>Governor Huckabee, </nameText></person>what do you think?</p><p>FMR. <person><nameText>GOV. MIKE HUCKABEE, </nameText></person>ARKANSAS: Well, I think the IRS issue is a huge one because you got one of the most powerful government agencies that have information on every citizen in this country and for them to take the power that they have and use it to crush people whose views they don't like, I think turns the IRS into a criminal enterprise. I know that strong word but I think that's exactly what it has become and the reason that we have to get to the bottom of it is because if you can't trust an agency of the federal government without much power, you really lost trust in the federal government completely.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, you know, a lot of people, if you think about it, Secretary, lost for us HHS and they might be attained with this switch in leaders but the fact of the matter is this is going to be a learning curve and in the middle of that curve is the IRS who (INAUDIBLE) up and running, already doing a lot of this administrative healthcare law. What do you think of that?</p><p>TOMMY THOMPSON, FMR. HHS SECRETARY: Well, I'm very concerned about is as <person><nameText>Governor Huckabee </nameText></person>has just indicated, the IRS seems to be off the reservation, being investigated by Congress in many different ways. Lois Lerner refuses to answer any questions and the attorney general says they are investigating but we all know that Benghazi and the armed situation in Mexico, the bait-and-switch operation, the conservatives that have been attacked by IRS, all indicate to me the IRS is not the agency to be running healthcare in America.</p><p>CAVUTO: But it is now. But it is, right? And governor, it is the default (INAUDIBLE) for this because but there are no others doing it for the time being and yet they are the ones collecting revenue and policing to how it's going to be enforced (INAUDIBLE) those who didn't pay right now, make sure they better pay. There is a lot of power here.</p><p>THOMPSON: 16,000 employees have been hired by IRS to do the policing of this. If you think that your taxes are going to be audited wait until you have 16,000 individuals who are on America whose only job is to find people that are not signing up for health care. I think it's an awesome power, an awesome responsibility and it's going to cause a lot of concern as <person><nameText>Governor Huckabee </nameText></person>has said across America.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, not exactly awesome to us though, is it.</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, one of the concerns that we have to have is the privacy issue. Think about the IRS having detailed medical information about people who are qualifying for certain federal subsidies, or they have the opportunity to have access to data. It's really is none of their business. Now this is an agency that leased out information regarding the International Organization for Marriage and their donors, that blew up horribly for the NON and so you've already found that the IRS can't keep a secret.</p><p>How can you possibly trust them with people's health care records? It is outrageous.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, secretary, are you going to expect any changes now with the new head coming in, presumably she's not going to encounter that much resistance taking over HHS? Or is it still going to be much the same? The underlying problem is the underlying law itself.</p><p>THOMPSON: Well, the problem has always been with (INAUDIBLE) is that the White House runs it but they never really gave <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>the opportunity. They blamed her and they put her as the face of Affordable Care but it's truly the White House who is doing it.</p><p>I believe the new secretary is going to have more powers to make changes because I think she probably requested it of the president. But there is still going to be a continuation because in the rule - in the law that was passed, the second law that was passed, people really don't understand this, Neil, that the first law that was passed in Congress, that was signed into law did not work.</p><p>So they had to pass a remedial bill that gave awesome powers to the secretary over 1,000 shelves are in that particular bill and those proclamation, that rule making is going to continue under the new secretary as it did under the old and that is really one of the problems with the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>CAVUTO: Which you argued as the problem itself, the law itself, right?</p><p>HUCKABEE: Well, it's the law itself. <person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>is like the astronauts sitting on top of the rocket. She's sitting there on top of $100 million worth of equipment designed by the lowest bidder. And so in many ways she can't be blamed for everything that was sitting up under her. I do think she could be faulted for going out there and giving the Pollyanna, everything is coming up roses speech all the time and not being more honest but I've known Kathleen as a governor. She was an insurance commissioner. She knew better.</p><p>But I think she was doing the work of the administration. They put her in an impossible situation. They gave her a car that wouldn't drive. No wonder she couldn't drive it.</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, thank you both, very much. We'll watch closely.</p><p>We got a lot more coming. Who do you think Harry Reid is really worried about these days? What if I told you, not this guy. What if I told you these guys. Then I heard of pay to play but pay to quit. You look at Amazon and not really into it, Bill cut you a check to leave it. How big a check would your boss have to write to get you to chuck it. We're on it.</p><p>And Tom Delay now smelling blood and telling Republicans don't you dare give an inch.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, now they are saying nice things about her. Weeks ago, they were demanding her head. Now Republicans (INAUDIBLE) their best wishes as Sebelius just heads out. Congressman Darryl Issa, \"<person><nameText>Kathleen Sebelius </nameText></person>had a supremely difficult job.\" Eric Cantor posting on Twitter \"I thank Secretary Sebelius for her service. She had an impossible task.\" Senator Orrin Hatch, \"Secretary Sebelius did the best she could during the tumultuous and volatile roll out of the law.\"</p><p>With me now, Center for American Progress' Emily Tisch Sussman. Emily, what do you make of this? Obviously, they're quietly delighted she is gone but maybe getting a little ahead of themselves? What?</p><p>EMILY TISCH SUSSMAN, CENTER FOR AMERICAN PROGRESS: Yes, well, first, I think it's very nice they're not asking her to hit the door on the way out, nicely giving her some compliment on her way out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Actually one of them did. I left that one out. But you're right, most of them were pretty nice.</p><p>SUSSMAN: That's very nice. I think that one, they are setting themselves up to actually have a pretty smooth confirmation process. You know, for the next nominee who is coming in from OMB. I think they don't want to have a tough fight around that. I think they're setting themselves up for that. But I also think that there was an acknowledgement that Secretary Sebelius had an extremely difficult task as they had mentioned.</p><p>But one of the things I think (INAUDIBLE) talked about as much is the fact that she actually went out, went beyond the politics and reached out to Republican governors to go state by state and try to convince them to actually take the Medicaid expansion.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I'm always wanting - you know, they always look for a sacrificial lamb every time they force someone out or want to force someone out but she did not strike me as being up on old details of the law but then again, neither did her bosses at the White House. So I'm just wondering whether just changing ahead of an agency is really going to change all the problem we had seen with this law or do we take Steny Hoyer and his word, who was here not too long ago, saying, you give this thing time. Things are going to get better. They are getting better. What do you think?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Look, I think that she left at a natural point. It wasn't like she was forced out and by all accounts the president didn't ask her to step down. She offered to step down. She has been there from the beginning.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wait a minute. She said - is this the first time she offered to step down because sometimes - is this the first time she offered to step down because sometimes when someone offers that - like I offered to resign every day and \"Neil, you can't go. Please no. No.\"</p><p>SUSSMAN: They haven't taken you up yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: No. When they take you up on it is when you get nervous. So obviously they didn't wait a nanosecond to say \"Oh, you got to go. OK. Bye.\"</p><p>SUSSMAN: Look, she has outlasted all of the major cabinet positions with the exception of Holder and Arne Duncan. She has lasted every major milestone. She's been there. She is really - she has had her slug through. This is a natural point. They announced last week -</p><p>CAVUTO: What is the natural point? Post the number of enrollees that they announced?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Exactly.</p><p>CAVUTO: After that she could go.</p><p>SUSSMAN: Certainly. You know, at the end of the first open enrolment period -</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>SUSSMAN: They were aiming for 7.1 million enrollees. They hit 7.5. It's an estimation that it's 10 million that weren't insured before, now have insurance. This is the natural point for (INAUDIBLE) turnover.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well those are debatable. Those are debatable numbers, right? I mean, we talked about how many paid? How many really are real?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Neil, all of that will come out. We'll see that in the next - I mean -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: But you think better news (INAUDIBLE) I hear what you're saying. What you're saying better news is ahead and these Republicans who were delighting in her departure, Sebelius' departure, might be getting ahead of themselves, right?</p><p>SUSSMAN: You know, I think that's true. They've been so hard on there's no compromise. There's no way to work out the law. It's repeal, repeal, repeal. It's over. I think politically that moment has passed. Now you need to look at what is maybe not working so well and move - you know, as any major law.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>SUSSMAN: This is not a surprise that there are pieces of the law that need to be adjusted as you go. That's to be expected.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you surprised though that even with - let's say the news is looking better. That a lot of vulnerable Democrats running for re-election are avoiding it like the plague, still?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Well, I think they are looking at poll by poll in their state but many of them aren't. Many of them are running on the law.</p><p>CAVUTO: Who? Who's running on it? Who is making it their cause?</p><p>SUSSMAN: Look, I think we have to look no further than Arkansas and just say that, you know, Prior is saying this has been something that has been good for Arkansas. I also think when we're talking about the politics, let's look at the Republicans state governors who have gone through and who have now accepted the Medicaid expansion, particularly Ohio with Kasik there, Gov. Jan Brewer in Arizona. Though she's not running for re- election now. But Kasik and Corben in Pennsylvania.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, you raised a good point.</p><p>SUSSMAN: These are governors -</p><p>CAVUTO: You raised a good point.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SUSSMAN: Not only (INAUDIBLE) protest they have larger ambitions. They must think that this is politically great for them.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's also easy money.</p><p>SUSSMAN: Never a problem there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Emily Tisch Sussman, thank you. Very good seeing you again.</p><p>And next, paying dollars to get dead weight out the door. Well Amazon is trying to (INAUDIBLE) for it. Then the politician who's got a serious coke addiction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID, HOUSE SPEAKER: Mr. President, you know, I'm not afraid of this Coke Brothers, Coke Brothers, Coke Brothers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. I want you to meet the guest who says \"Harry, you have got to get over this Coke fix.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REID: Coke Brothers, Coke Brothers, Coke Brothers, Coke Brothers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: So not into working at Amazon, how about a $5,000 check to get you to quit Amazon. Don't laugh. Amazon is quite serious, convinced that paying workers who aren't all that into their job, to leave their job, helps keep workers who remain jazzed in their jobs.</p><p>Steve Odland, the former Office Depot chairman on whether this makes good business sense and radio host, political sensation Gina Loudon on whether it makes good people cents. The people part first. It doesn't make sense.</p><p>GINA LOUDON, PH.D., RADIO HOST &amp; AUTHOR: You know, this is public relations. I don't know how long ago it was but I was on your show and we were talking about the drones. Remember they're going to be delivering packages by drones. We had the Microsoft (INAUDIBLE), we've had these incidences come up again and again. And this is for publicity. The thing I kind of like about this one is it is actually doable. Delivering packages by drone, probably not doable and the Microsoft bra - I don't even know what was going on with that. But this is actually something that -</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm remembering a Microsoft (INAUDIBLE), not doable?</p><p>LOUDON: Well, OK. Maybe but not. It was a publicity stand.</p><p>CAVUTO: Understand.</p><p>LOUDON: Even though this is a publicity stunt, at least it is something that is truly applicable and doable for the (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. Steve, I'm back to Amazon and paying people to just, you know, take a hike. What do you think of that?</p><p>STEVE ODLAND, FMR. OFFICE DEPOT CEO: Well, this is not a publicity stand. This is something that has been in place at Zappos.com for quite some time and they're CEO Tony Hsieh implemented this many years ago and I had a chance to meet with him and they got a chance to get people to stand back and say \"Look, are you happy? Are you not happy? If you're not happy, why? But here's an incentive for you to go, if you're not.</p><p>And the kids -</p><p>CAVUTO: Well how much is it? How much are they paying because Zappos, if my memory serves me right, they sell shoes online, right? I mean, I get such really good shoes, you're going to be passionate about. If you're not maybe (INAUDIBLE). But did it work?</p><p>ODLAND: So, well, it worked fine and they had a really interesting culture and then Zappos now had been purchased by Amazon. So the sub story here is that this is very unusual for an acquiring company, particularly a bigger one like Amazon to adopt a procedure or a policy that was in a company that they acquired and I think what Jeff Bezos should be applauded for is taking this and introducing it to Amazon.</p><p>The fact is very few employees actually take advantage of it but it does give them a chance to stand back and to reassess on whether they are happy because the whole point is if you're not happy you're not going to be giving the customer service that you want to happen in the company and therefore you're better off having those unhappy people leave.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: In Bezos' case, he just (INAUDIBLE) the \"Washington Post,\" I can guarantee you half of those guys are miserable. Just because that's their disposition.</p><p>LOUDON: But that's why - you know, the psychology, the reverse psychology of this actually were is that it is fascinating here because it does - you know, my background is in organizational development and this does boost employee morale. It gives people permission to go, to make a decision on a yearly basis, am I happy? Am I not happy? And so they're going to be -</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Why offer them a check? I mean, Jack Welch was saying this for the GE days of weeding out the dead wood or those who really weren't jazz because he thought negative attitudes were contagious and all and just got rid of them. They didn't offer a check to leave the door, just said you're out.</p><p>LOUDON: It's a very polite way to show people the door if they want to take it -</p><p>CAVUTO: But if you're earning 50,000 a year and you are given a check for 5,000 to leave your job, you're not going to take a $5,000 check?</p><p>LOUDON: No, of course not. But the point is that you could. So it gives that employee that internal sense of that locus of control. They feel more in control, they're generally more content in their work and they're going to tend, probably stay longer and have better positive employee (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>CAVUTO: I see. It makes sense. But Steve, I always think that I know what Amazon was trying to do here. They want to (INAUDIBLE) and engage workforce and the not so subtle message here is if you're not jazz, you're not into it. Here's 5,000 bucks and get the heck out of here. But what if it doesn't work and they're offering this and people don't take them up on it. Is that when the firing start?</p><p>ODLAND: Well, you know, I'm sure that they do terminate people or they manage people out as well but I think it's much better to have a caring approach versus the stick approach. The stick approach teaches -</p><p>CAVUTO: Again, Steve, how would a $5,000 check do that?</p><p>ODLAND: It's because it allows and the conversation to happen in a positive way and people, you know, to raise their hand and say, you know, I'm going to take this and I'm going to go. And it gives people the chance to, you know, supervises the change to say to them \"Look, do you want to take advantage of this thing?\" So there's some subtle encouragement. It's the carrot rather than saying there's a culture of fear where we're going to fire you.</p><p>CAVUTO: What if they get workman's compensation if they do that?</p><p>LOUDON: In a $50,000 a year job, it's more than care, it's more like a cupcake. I know you can relate to that. Right?</p><p>CAVUTO: That has no meaning to be such a (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>So you think that if done properly this could work?</p><p>LOUDON: I think if done properly what this does is boost morale on a regular basis.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, what do you think of the surviving workers then. See, their buddies go with a $5,000 check?</p><p>LOUDON: It's better than seeing their buddies go with nothing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Maybe they're getting more work to do.</p><p>LOUDON: It's better than their buddies go with nothing and they can always, you know, hire more people. We need jobs out there.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you think of that? I mean, if they go, Steve, then the remaining workers are stuck doing the losers' jobs, right?</p><p>ODLAND: Yes, but they have the opportunity to go.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>ODLAND: So I think, net-net, it's a positive thing because it ends up with a more committed work force, somebody who has thought through and who said, you know, I really want to be here.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Well, I think Gina is on to something if they pay them all with food. I mean, I don't know. We could be talking something here.</p><p>Guys, thank you both very much.</p><p>LOUDON: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, (INAUDIBLE) 35 hour workweek then mandatory vacation at totaling at least five weeks and now no more e-mails after 6:00 p.m. any day, any week, always. The new law that makes me think the over the top arrogant dude in that Cadillac ad might be right on.</p><p>But first, it's hammer time. Tom Delay delighted that she's out, now telling Republicans man, up. And when it comes to this health care law don't give Democrats an inch.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, forget about trying to make it to work. Tom Delay is telling Republicans to do with the law what they (INAUDIBLE) due to the woman who was in charge of that law, making history too. The former Republican leader joining me now.</p><p>So Tom, your essential message, you've said this before. You've been consistent. Hang tough, be tough, don't do anything to keep this thing going, right?</p><p>TOM DELAY, FMR. HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: That's exactly right. First of all, Neil, the federal government being involved in health insurance is unconstitutional. And not only that but has whole Obamacare has been based on the wrong premise. You want the federal government to get in to running our health care system and create a huge new entitlement program, all for the sake of however many people don't have insurance who have chosen not to have insurance.</p><p>And Nancy Pelosi said yesterday, and it's just amazing to me that she was very proud of Sebelius for creating a right of health care for the federal government and for the American people. Healthcare is not a right, it's a responsibility and it needs to be repelled. It doesn't need to be fixed. And it doesn't need to be replaced. It needs to be repealed.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, (INAUDIBLE) if you ever see the former speaker, Tom, is to keep calling it Obamacare. It drives her nuts. Affordable Care, Affordable Care. So it just drives her nuts. So if I ever bump into her, I always say Obamacare, Obamacare.</p><p>Anyway, do you think that when Republicans were working with these provisions that would drop some of the burdens and rules and access regulations off of small businesses, even though they were doing it ostensibly to help those businesses - it was done by a voice vote too which was weird, the unintended consequences that was keeping this thing going longer.</p><p>DELAY: Well, I'm not sure about that. If there is no mandate for small businesses, that is repealing the law step-by-step, we could do it that way or do it wholesale but taking the mandatory out of the small business, and I would like to see them take the mandatory out for individuals that eviscerates the law. You don't have much of a law anymore.</p><p>CAVUTO: So when Robert Gibbs was talking about removing that mandate or very likely that the businessman that would go and that got Nancy Pelosi almost as upset as saying Obamacare, Obamacare, Obamacare. That got her annoyed. What do you make of that and what he was more or less acknowledging?</p><p>DELAY: Well, he was acknowledging that they were taking Obamacare apart piece by piece. The next piece that needs to be taken out is the entitlement part. People aren't paying attention that most of the people that have signed up are getting subsidies. This is a new entitlement, just like Medicare or Medicaid, especially Medicaid. Both of those are going to bankrupt us and bankrupt the state if we don't do something about it. And now we're layering another one and where all these people are getting subsidies from the American taxpayer. This just can't be sustained unless we want to replace it with single payer government runs everything like Europe or Canada, and that will be the end of our health care system.</p><p>CAVUTO: I don't want to sound jaded or -- I think that that was their intention all along, that insurance companies quite naturally would have to start upping and hiking their rates to cover all the new additions, and that the administration foresaw this, saw the people would be getting angry at insurance companies for doing that. And ultimately we will go in that direction. And then what?</p><p>DELAY: That is where they are headed. And now they want to invite the Republicans in to fix it and going to make that part of the campaign this year.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, what would you do?</p><p>DELAY: What I would do is elect Republicans to the Senate, as many as you can get over there in the Senate. Elect some more good, solid conservatives in the House, and just start throwing repeals to Obama for the next two years and make sure that this Obamacare is a major part in the next presidential election. That is what I would do.</p><p>CAVUTO: In the meantime, the administration is crowing about they are getting more and more people signing up for this, more and more people signing up for Medicaid, it might be for the various reasons that you alluded to, that they are switching from one government program to another, and taxing Americans in the process. But that the trend will be their friend, and actually come November, it might not be that big of an issue, or the issue that Republicans hope. What do you think?</p><p>DELAY: That's just not going to happen. You're going to have more bad stuff. Every month, there is another bad news about this. Even the national media cannot avoid telling the American people about it, and you can bet that those millions that are getting their health care insurance canceled are telling their friends. This election has been set, and the American people have lost all trust in this president, have lost all trust in the Democrats. They have no credibility. If the Republicans don't screw it up, this is going to be another wave election.</p><p>CAVUTO: Let's see. They have grabbed defeat from the jaws of victory in the past, you know.</p><p>DELAY: Well, 2010 was a good election. And the American people have had it. Have had it. And they don't want any more of it. And anyone that has had anything to do with it is going to be thrown out if we have a good opponent against them.</p><p>CAVUTO: We'll watch closely. Tom DeLay, it's always a pleasure.</p><p>DELAY: Thank you, Neil. It's great to be with you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Meanwhile, maybe the guy in that Cadillac ad was right.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Other countries, they work, they stroll home, they stop by the cafe. They take August off. Off. Why aren't you like that? Why aren't we like that? Because we're crazy, driven, hard working believers, that's why.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: I love it when he just acknowledges the other child. Anyway, maybe that is why the rest of the world really are a bunch of wusses. Because something the French just did sacre bleu my mind.</p><p>CAVUTO: Time for our viewerr (ph) segment, or should I say le viewer (ph). Tonight a French twist, because for the folks not exactly big on work, a move that proves these guys, who for some reason like to plop an egg on everything, really are a piece of work. France wants to ban email, all e- mails after 6:00 p.m., says it just gets in the way of family life and gets in the way of sipping a latte at the cafe for hours at a time and ignoring your family. But (inaudible) tweets this is a sure bet to make French employees even more unproductive. Still another from Leneck (ph). Just more senseless regulation. That's why their economy is in la (inaudible). And finally, (inaudible) who tweets, Neil, I cannot comment. Must be after 6:00 p.m. somewhere. That's very clever.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make of this?</p><p>DAVID ASMAN, FBN: I think it's great news for us, the competitors. Anybody who competes with the French, this is great news. We love to work. What they call our greed and our type A personality, we call good work. You work hard and it helps you get ahead, helps you move up. It also helps you get as much money as you can possibly get. I don't think that's a bad thing, but apparently they do.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: We're missing life. We're in such a rush.</p><p>ASMAN: What is scary though is the extent to which this administration and a lot of people in America now want us to move us towards the French way in terms of health care. (inaudible), remember when that CBO report came out saying Americans are going to work less because of Obamacare? The administration said, that is great. They could become poets. They could move to France and drink latte at the cafes. That ain't what makes the American dream, brother.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you know, you and I can remember a time when you went on vacation, no one bothered you. Now you have to have your device with you. Maybe they're on to something.</p><p>ASMAN: You and I can remember a lot of times we should've forgotten long ago. You know what I'm saying?</p><p>[LAUGHTER]</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Somehow I can picture that. But this idea where we are 24/7 working, and we're on, our gadgets are on, we have to be on, we have to be engaged, the French just don't see it.</p><p>ASMAN: The greatest thing about America is not necessarily the people who were born here, but the immigrants that come here, and they work 14 to 18 hours a day. You better believe they wouldn't accept these French rules. In fact, some of the immigrants are probably from France.</p><p>People who come here and appreciate the fact that if you work here, you get rewards. I guess over there, you have such high tax rates, if you work hard, eventually doesn't pay to work that much. So maybe you should sit back...</p><p>CAVUTO: I think that is a profound point right there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Issue two, almost as maddening as the French.</p><p>A guy who's just as fried, Harry Reid, look at this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. HARRY REID, D-NEV.: Mr. President, I am not afraid of the Koch brothers.</p><p>Koch brothers--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: The Senate majority leader apparently thinking that the Koch brothers are a bigger threat than Vladimir Putin could ever be. It's true. In an analysis of Nevada Democrat's public comments last month, the Koch brothers were mentioned 65 times. Vlad apparently only once. That's got our Twitter followers going nuts. One writing it is Senator Harry Reid who is the biggest threat to the United States. Another, no, George Soros is the biggest threat. One more from Nac (ph). Phrasing it in a different way. Who is the bigger threat to Harry Reid's job? What do you make of that?</p><p>ASMAN: The Democrats have failed miserably to stop the advance of our enemy, and I think Vladimir Putin is our enemy. At least right now he is. Maybe he'll switch eventually. But they have succeeded very well in lambasting people who have created 60,000 jobs. Koch Industries, 60,000. By the way, many of those jobs are union jobs, I think about a third of them are union. So they are friends to unions as well, and they have given away hundreds of millions, I am not exaggerating.</p><p>CAVUTO: It was George Soros who is just as influential, if not more so. He's influential and more so on the left.</p><p>ASMAN: But they make George Soros look like a piker when it comes to giving money to good causes. I'm not talking about political causes here. They just gave $100 million to a hospital after which, by the way, Harry Reid got on the floor and said, they're taking advantage of the poor cancer patients by using them and exploiting them. The fact is, they gave $100 million to the Presbyterian Hospital here in New York.</p><p>CAVUTO: But you can't pick and choose your billionaires and their causes, right? I mean, if you're OK with George Soros doing what he's doing, simply because he gives to liberal causes, which you like, shouldn't you lump him with the Koch brothers, then, if that's going to be your--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ASMAN: If you're honest, you have to do that. But what really gets me about Harry Reid is him calling these people and I am quoting now, as un- American as anyone that I can imagine. What is un-American about building a huge enterprise that employs 60,000 people? What is un-American about giving $100 million to a hospital, $600 million to various institutions in New York, including a lot of artsy-fartsy stuff that you like.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: -- the way they go after Sheldon Adelson, a big Republican--</p><p>ASMAN: From Las Vegas.</p><p>CAVUTO: That any of them are bad, any of them are bad, but the left leaning billionaires that give to causes that they like, they're never going to be cited.</p><p>ASMAN: So why are you looking for consistency with their arguments? There is none!</p><p>CAVUTO: There really is none at all.</p><p>ASMAN: I haven't seen it. And you pointed out just one of many inconsistent examples.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: -- move to France and cut off everything at 6:00 p.m.?</p><p>ASMAN: Well, because they don't want to lose their billions. You know, they have this millionaire tax over in France. I think, in fact, there are a lot of nothing will turn someone into a conservative more than a high tax rate. That is what happened in England, that's what happened in Sweden. They went from a socialist government to give it to a free-market government, and maybe it will happen here too.</p><p>CAVUTO: (inaudible), word of warning. They put eggs on everything. Meanwhile, coming up, former secretary of state, Condy Rice, just landed a very big job at a very big tech firm. But the critics have already started an Internet campaign against it and her. Find out why. But first, that refund you've been waiting for? I hate to break it to you, the IRS has already cashed a check. Not because you owe them money, but because your parents do. I'm not kidding, kids. Blame it on pops, kid. But apparently, it is all perfectly legal. Kids.</p><p>CAVUTO: In tonight's Biz Blitz, getting hosed at the IRS, and you really don't have to be a conservative, just a taxpayer whose parents owe money. Because if the tax man isn't getting the dough from them, he's going to get it from you. And it's all apparently perfectly legal. They don't pay, you pay. To Gary B. Smith and Keith Fitz Gerald and Jonas Max Ferris on whether the IRS is going a little too far here. Gary, what do you think?</p><p>GARY B. SMITH: Not just a little, way too far. Neil, in this case, it's almost impossible for the taxpayer to fight it. One, the Social Security often doesn't even have the records detailing this overpayment, or you don't have the records because the IRS says you only have to keep your records for three years. Or you don't have the money to fight it. So it's -- I guess it is a perfect scam on behalf of the government to collect money where you have to say, well, I guess I have to pay.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Keith, it's one thing to take your refund back because of something you screwed up on your taxes or you owe money from prior years. I didn't even know they were allowed to do this if a relative was in this position. It's just weird to me.</p><p>KEITH FITZ-GERALD: This is a stinkbomb of the highest order, and I think it demonstrates everything that is wrong with our government at the present time. This dates, as I understand it, to a singular cause in a farm bill or something years and years ago. The fact that the government has chosen to go after these people now, I think is symptomatic of the fact that they are totally out of control. I don't like the presumptions of innocence being taken away.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Jonas, the argument for this is we have seen cases like this before, where you settle your parents estate, whatever is owed on that estate, has to be paid first before any funds can make their way to heirs. So how is that different than this or this from that?</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS: If you look at it that way, your money goes to your kids if it's under a certain amount without the government stepping in. So if you have debts, then why should those just go to the government taxpayers? In some ways, the kids should also be responsible, so you can make the case. The government is very heavy-handed, and a very (inaudible) about how they collect money. You don't want to owe the government money. You don't want to rip them off because there are laws going back to the Civil War that are very serious about them going after you.</p><p>I will say, they are finally stepping it up. You have seen this when they went after the foreigners (ph), the IRS, the Swiss bank accounts, look at all the Medicare fraud that has been going on. There's a lot of ripping off of government, all the way down to Social Security, disability, Medicare, so I like to see the government stepping it up and tightening up, but this is a very kind of ham-handed way to get at this problem.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is goose-stepping it up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: It is weird. Judging our next president by the company they keep or the company with whom they have been keeping close ties, whether it's Condy Rice's role at Drop Box or Jeb Bush's service at Barclays Bank. Or Hillary, is that a shoe coming my way Clinton, getting 200 grand for a speech at Goldman Sachs. Should these corporate connections stick? And Gary, could they prove sticky? What do you think?</p><p>SMITH: Neil, I think this all boils down to, again, it's partisan politics. You know, the group that protested Rice with joining that board of directors at Drop Box said it's not partisan, but here are issues. No. 1, she helped start the Iraq war. Two, she helped to create Bush's torture program, and three, she served on the board of Chevron. I mean, this is -- the left out to get anyone associated with Bush, anyone associated with the Republican Party. It's just criminal.</p><p>CAVUTO: I just wonder if they make a big deal of anyone's corporate connections in the past. They are free to go wherever they want, they're free to take speech money from whoever they want, barring some dictator, I guess, it's always in the eye of the beholder, Keith. But this, to me, just seems like ancillary (ph) noise, but what do you think?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: I think it is ridiculous. Where were they when Henry Kissinger stepped up for AmEx or (inaudible) or any of these other companies? There are lots of guys who go from Wall Street to Washington and back and forth. They either have got to come to an agreement that that kind of behavior is not a complete no-no or they need to get off their high horse.</p><p>CAVUTO: What do you make of that, Jonas?</p><p>FERRIS: I thought the whole point of being a public servant at low pay was the corporate gravy train later and all the boards and --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERRIS: I'm not kidding. If you take away that gravy train, you will have bigger losers going into politics. That's one of the reasons that people take those jobs who are skilled.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERRIS: This specific case, I think there is a hint of legitimacy. The Drop Box thing is more about the paranoia about the government snooping on your files, Drop Box is a file sharing on the cloud, they hoard, they literally have all your data that you put there on the cloud. So it smells bad to have anybody from the government who is involved.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, I want to switch this around and talk about another development that could be very interesting maybe as this spring home shopping buying season tries to take root. Because indications are, and we have seen a lot of companies, JPMorgan Chase the latest, to say the home lending business, mortgage business, is down a lot, applications, and interest in it, off of 60 some odd percent. This shouldn't be happening this time of year. So what is going on? Should we worry? It's buffeting stocks, buffeting banks, really walloping out markets, who knows, Gary, into a correction? What do you think?</p><p>SMITH: I think we should be worried, but maybe not for the reason that you're thinking of. I think we should be worried that this is just government intrusion that has stepped all over these financial institutions. I tried to refinance about six, seven months ago, and I had to pore through so much paperwork, jump through so many hoops.</p><p>CAVUTO: You did?</p><p>SMITH: Just to refinance and pay a lower rate. If the government stepped out of the mortgage housing business, I think we'd be a lot better off.</p><p>CAVUTO: Whatever is going on here, people are just not into it. Keith, you were astute enough to point this out some months ago when the banks started laying off a lot of their mortgage personnel, that maybe that was the tipping hand here, but what's going on?</p><p>FITZ-GERALD: Well, there is a very simple explanation. No. 1, people have had it with big banks. No. 2, the government is all over them. But no. 3, more importantly, they have stepped into the retail market. Black Rock spent hundreds of millions of dollars. Groups out of California have spent hundreds of millions of dollars buying tens of thousands of homes, for the same purpose that everybody else is. They want to flip it, they want renters, everything else. So it's thrown the markets for a loop, it's brought mortgage applications down, because these guys are cash buyers, thanks to guess what, all the baiouts and all the derivatives that they sell and used to generate money on the other side of the house as collateral.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Jonas, I know you're in Miami, and that's a market that's been rebounding on the notion that things are back and maybe not to the giddiness they were prior to the meltdown, but certainly the lending is back, the building is back, and Miami is back, real estate is back. Maybe it's not.</p><p>FERRIS: The lending has loosened up a lot. Not all the way, there's no condo hotel on the (inaudible). But I will say, I think there is a little simpler explanation. I think the consumer backs off when the 10-year gets to about 3 percent, and rates for loans go up with it. They just don't want to -- they can't afford the house, the payments--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of them are reporting that they are interested in getting a loan, but the banks are not giving it to them.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FERRIS: I think the lending is pretty loose right now. It's never going to go back to the ninja days so don't -- that is not the benchmark for how lending is supposed to be. But today lending is pretty available if you have any down payment, or if you have got equity in your house, if you have income. It's not what it was in 2005 down here, but I think the rates are low and when they go low like this week, and when you see paranoia in the market, you're going to see I think applications --</p><p>CAVUTO: I think this negativity feeds on itself. That is my worry. I don't think it's justified, but I do think it feeds on itself.</p><p>SMITH: Well, I mean, if you have an income of a million dollars a year and a credit score of 799, you have no problem getting a loan. But then you don't need one. But for most other people out there, the other fear I think is that people are still worried about the economy, they are still worried about having a job. I don't care, they probably don't want a mortgage at any rate.</p><p>CAVUTO: Something is going on. We'll keep an eye on it. Gentlemen, thank you, again. Meanwhile, what is worse? Telling a lie? Or well, spouting a number that's a lie? I've reported and you have apparently decided. All of you folks in the White House? You just might want to run for cover.</p><p>CAVUTO: And what is the deal? With a president who promised us we could keep our doctor when we couldn't and now is asking us to believe his health care enrollment numbers. But maybe we shouldn't. Paddle, stat, Washington stat credibility zero. Stat.</p><p>Eric writes there are three kinds of lies, Neil. Lies, damned lies, and these statistics. Mary Ann, President Obama lost what little credibility he had when he lied to the American people about keeping their health care. Good luck getting us to believe anything else, ever. Beverly tweets, I'm losing trust in the entire government. Waste, fraud, and abuse on both sides. You're right about that. Bryce, who in the world actually believes anything he is saying? Fewer and fewer. Tom in New Jersey, Cavuto, you're a fine one to talk about trust. You look like a used car salesman and you wear a toupee.</p><p>Tom, you are bald, aren't you?</p><p>Mark, in Cranford, New Jersey, Cavuto, if I were you, I would just out and speed up on that rocket they are building for you and leave now. This planet is lost. Get out now, but please take me with you.</p><p>Well, I'm not giving up yet, Mark, but to be safe, I am moving full speed ahead on that rocket thing. Clark in New Rochelle, I've never believed any of your numbers, but that has not stopped me from watching you. I find you funny, just like I find the president funny. You're both funny. Funny how, Clark? Funny like a clown? What do you mean by funny? Do I amuse you?</p><p>PT via Yahoo. Numbers that back up lies are just lying numbers. Profound, PT, very profound. Dexter emails, if you were a number, Cavuto, I'd give you a zero, because you're a zero. Your ethics are zero, your looks are zero, your IQ is zero. Zero, zero, zero. Yet you have emailed me before, Dexter. So that makes you a zero watching a zero, which is like zero to infinity, zero.</p><p>Jenny tweets, love Cavuto, he cracks me up, he's handsome, plus he has a sense of humor and the ability to go through these Obamacare numbers. Which by the way does take a sense of humor. Ken writes, Cavuto, you are a butthead. Ken, you are an idiot. Karen writes, Neil, interview me please. I'm older but dependable and honest. I'm going to think about that, Karen, because I'm kind of running out of options in the dependable and honest category. Pudding tweets, do you let your small children say hosed? Which means screwed? Which means, you know, I know? Watch your mouth on TV. You are a nasty hypocrite.</p><p>First of all, you go by the name Pudding, and you're giving me morality lessons? Really, Pudding?</p><p>Anyway. Frank writes, Neil, you are the shining star of Fox. If people don't watch you, they don't know what they're missing. So true. I tell this to my wife all the time. Frank, all the time. Thanks for writing, good, bad or anything in between, have a safe weekend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CAVUTO-2914041101cb223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CAVUTO2914</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BYS-8RM1-JB20-G154-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347932</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2914 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CAVUTO</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>April 12, 2014</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000833</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N922120CC</classCode><className>LAW ENFORCEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000833</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>PE0009UMR</classCode><className>KATHLEEN SEBELIUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>PE0009TK2</classCode><className>MICHAEL HUCKABEE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>PE000A5DL</classCode><className>NEIL CAVUTO</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009TJW</classCode><className>TOMMY THOMPSON</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS119</classCode><className>ARKANSAS, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

In a unique move last week, the parent of social media app Snapchat sold $3.4 billion of shares to outside investors with no voting rights, raising concerns that those stockholders wouldn't get enough transparency or influence on matters like executive pay or strategy. </p><p>\"Unequal voting rights present complex and new issues that need to be understood and addressed,\" Commissioner Kara Stein, a Democrat, said at a meeting of the SEC's Investor Advisory Committee in Washington. \"We also must be mindful of the precedent being created.\" Stein said the agency should \"focus on how some innovations may prove detrimental to investors.\" Other big tech giants have offered shares with limited voting rights to outsiders in recent years; Snap[4] was the first to offer shares to outside investors with no voting rights at all. Institutional Investment Take Reuters noted the topic of unequal voting rights comes at a time when three of the five commission seats at SEC are currently empty and the sole member other than Stein, Republican Michael Piwowar, is its acting chairman. President Donald Trump has nominated Wall Street attorney Jay Clayton, also a Republican, as the U.S. securities regulator's permanent head. His confirmation would put Stein in the minority and possibly limit her influence. Meanwhile, Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents large pension funds and other asset managers, said share structures like Snap's pose risks such as leaving founders in control decades after their prime. \"At some point,\" Reuters said quoting Bertsch, \"there's some question of market confusion and a disabling of passive strategies.\" Related: Dan Nathan's Snap Options Trade[5] Snap Finds An Early Home At The $23 Area[6] \u00a9 2017 Benzinga.com.

After months of talks, industry and consumer privacy groups see momentum on a bill that failed in 2019. The privacy groups said a draft last week improves upon the previous version they thought weighed too heavily in industry's favor.</p><p>Up against the buzzer last spring, the House didn't take up a Senate-passed version that Microsoft and other tech companies backed but privacy groups condemned (see 1904180036). Carlyle sees \"a desire to get to yes\" and aims to gain consensus more quickly this time: \"I do not expect this to go to the last day.\" Carlyle spoke to new House Speaker Laurie Jinkins (D), who he said is \"very committed to resolution\" and more up on tech issues than the previous speaker. Releasing a draft two months before session starts allows time for feedback, Carlyle said this week.</p><p>Carlyle said he has listened \"very intently to the deep concerns of some of the opponents\" and is working closely with House Innovation, Technology and Economic Development Committee Chairman Zack Hudgins (D). Carlyle tried to make consumer rights more explicit and took another pass at consent, enforcement and various definitions, he said. Consumer groups had a \"very legitimate\" concern about a loophole allowing companies to continue using data even after a user requested its deletion, Carlyle said. He didn't add a private right of action sought by some privacy groups but would be open to reviewing that issue in a few years.</p><p>Washington's privacy bill is \"incredibly important to get right,\" said Center for Democracy and Technology Privacy and Data Project Director Michelle Richardson in an interview. \"Everybody's watching Washington as one of the most likely to get across the line\" in 2020 because lawmakers \"got so far last year.\" Businesses seek an alternative to the California Consumer Privacy Act to use as a model elsewhere, while consumer privacy groups see \"potential to add in new protections for users that we haven't seen in other states,\" including data minimization and secondary-use limitations, she said.</p><p>Privacy advocates complained last session about feeling excluded from the process in favor of Washington-based tech companies like Amazon and Microsoft. \"It's been a very open process,\" Carlyle said about the fresh effort to reach consensus, though he said process concerns are sometimes \"euphemisms for the outcome.\" Carlyle sees the presence of big tech companies in his state as an advantage for writing a good privacy bill.</p><p>Hudgins appreciates Carlyle \"listening to my concerns with such intentionality, and the clear changes he made to many parts of his bill,\" the House member emailed in an update last week with the new draft. \"I do have some concerns and questions and I am working through those details.\"</p><p>Positive Steps</p><p>The new draft would explicitly give consumers rights to opt out, as well as to access, correct, delete and move data.</p><p>It would require businesses to conduct a data protection assessment for personal data processing activities \"that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers, such as processing for purposes of targeted advertising or processing sensitive data,\" said a summary. The state attorney general would enforce the proposed law, which has no private right of action. Proposed privacy rules apply to businesses that target residents and that control or process data of more than 100,000 consumers or derive 50 percent of gross revenue from sale of personal information and control or process data of more than 25,000 consumers.</p><p>Washington's bill is \"moving in the right direction\" but isn't \"there yet,\" said CDT's Richardson. It has \"more principles that are about better corporate behavior and not just individual responsibilities,\" she said. But CDT is worried the bill is more concerned with whether a company tells consumers what it's going to do than making objective standards about what a company should be doing. The group supports a method for citizen complaints to supplement limited AG resources, though including a private right of action wouldn't likely be a \"red line\" for the group, Richardson said.</p><p>The measure is improved from last session, emailed Justin Brookman, Consumer Reports director-consumer privacy and technology policy. \"There's been more outreach than there was at this point last year,\" showing \"the extent of opposition from advocates last year may have surprised them.\" Brookman applauded removal of language \"predicating privacy rights on companies' internal risk determinations.\" He said lawmakers should tighten definitions including for sale, de-identified and pseudonymous, and add more consumer protections about first-party obligations and nondiscrimination.</p><p>The draft bill improves in some ways on the California Consumer Privacy Act and EU's general data protection regulation, said Interactive Advertising Bureau Senior Director-Public Policy Alex Propes in a statement: \"We welcome the acknowledgement of the benefits of pseudonymized data in providing meaningful protections to consumers.\" IAB supports opt-out here over opt-in in GDPR, he said. Differences with state laws in California and Nevada show \"the need for Congress to pass a uniform federal privacy standard that provides greater clarity to consumers and businesses alike,\" he said.</p><p>TechNet and members are reviewing the draft and conversing with legislators, said Samantha Kersul, TechNet executive director-Washington. Microsoft, Comcast and others in industry didn't comment through Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKP-0S81-DYRJ-04F4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

According to a prominent businessman, the SEC regulations are about to drive away the innovation from the United States to Asia and a new climate. If you are unfamiliar with them, it is safe to say that one of the leading crypto exchanges in the world Poloniex (owned by Circle) announced geofencing of nine assets on its platform recently. </p><p>This decision has led many to take a cautionary step fearing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its retribution. We are talking about Fred Wilson, who is the co-founder of Union Square Ventures. He recently voiced his opinion[2] towards the SEC regulations and the body's ruling to delist coins in the US cryptocurrency exchanges, labeling it as 'very damaging.' As many best cryptocurrency news sites[3] show, Wilson believed that hostile policies would eventually drive away innovation from Silicon Valley which according to him is the 'global epicenter of tech' to Asian countries. He tweeted pointing out to the SEC regulations: 'In 5-10 years when we look back and consider why the next big tech sector centered itself in Asia and not in the US, it will be the SEC's unwillingness to create new rules to regulate new assets that will be the cause.' <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1132045551594352646\">https://twitter.com/fredwilson/status/1132045551594352646</url> He cited Coinbase as an example and stated that 'most trusted/compliant/secure/safe' cryptocurrency exchanges were based in the United States. So, according to him, driving trading or liquidity to Asia is 'detrimental to safety and security.' An attorney at Byrne ...orm named Preston Byrne responded to the tweet concerning the SEC regulations, stating that 'alleged misconduct' in Asia would be harmful to the entire cryptocurrency space. He also emphasized that one of the major threats to Bitcoin adoption was the 'bad actors' who need to be properly identified and eliminated. '95% of trading volume is faked. The Bitfinex/Tether saga is insane and only just getting started. If crypto is going to be adopted, we need to have more trust in our trading venues. That requires close supervision of trading venues and markets.' Ari David Paul, the founder of BlockTower Capital, was also featured in the altcoin news[4] for reacting to the post and stating: 'Hopefully we're not headed toward a world where voluntary commerce can be stamped out globally. So for a global asset, this will always be an issue. Fortunately, you don't need to care. $1b in CME future volume is real and traceable. Manipulation is temporary by nature.'

Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p>SEIB:  I'm Jerry Seib, Washington -- executive Washington editor of the Wall Street Journal. I'm the moderator today, and I'll be presiding.</p><p>You know, the topic of today's conversation, as we agreed initially, is cyber-security and safeguarding U.S. elections, which we'll talk about because it's very timely, and -- and as we were just discussing, of broad significance around the country. There are some other issues. Border issues probably will come up. But we'll have plenty of time in the audience Q&amp;A to deal with issues beyond -- beyond cyber-security and elections.</p><p>But again, thank you for being here.</p><p>Let's talk about elections, because we are, as we speak, four days from what I think is a very charged and high-stakes election. Can Americans be confident their votes will count, that the system will hold, that there won't be interference, and that there won't be problems on Election Day?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, first of all, I just say we actually have an even higher bar.</p><p>SEIB:  OK.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we want to make sure that everyone's vote is counted, but is also counted correctly.</p><p>So as many of you know, there were concerns that proved unfounded, but as we see throughout the rest of the world with some of the attempts to hack the election infrastructure, there's also concern about the integrity. So we want to vote to count, we want it counted correctly.</p><p>What (inaudible), this is going to be the most secure election we've ever had. But as we all know, with this dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.</p><p>So as of today, we don't have any -- any indication that a foreign government has a sustained effort or a sustained plan to hack our election infrastructure. But having said that, the moment it changes, we, of course, will let our state and local partners know.</p><p>SEIB:  So, you know, you have said that the Russians probably attempted in 2016 to gain access to voting systems in all 50 states.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.</p><p>SEIB:  And they were, in fact, successful in a couple of cases. What are they doing now? And what did you learn from that 2016 experience?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah, so I think there's -- if I could, let me just back up and divide it into a couple different threats.</p><p>So the threat that DHS focuses on is any interference into the election infrastructure. So we work with our state and local partners, election officials, the Election Assistance Commission; I can go into a variety of other groups that we work with. But what we're trying to make sure is that that infrastructure, the voting -- the voter databases, the polling infrastructure, the voting machines are all secure.</p><p>The other threat, though, that we're facing, which is much more difficult to get our hands around, is the very pernicious attempts at influence by foreign governments. And this takes a variety of means. FBI has lead on that.</p><p>That's much more difficult. A lot of that, at the end of the day, is about educating the American public to think -- to think about what you're reading, think about the source, think about where it's coming from.</p><p>R.T., as you know, which is a self-proclaimed state agent of Russia, if you can believe it, in 2017 had more views on YouTube than CNN -- double the -- double amount of views. But that is a directly state-sponsored news agency.</p><p>So the -- that is much more difficult to combat. And that's China, that's Russia. We see that with Iran. We see the recent tape -- takedowns from Facebook.</p><p>So that's the FBI lead we support. I think we need to continue, as a country, to figure out how to combat that part.</p><p>But the election infrastructure, we've done a tremendous amount at the front end of training, and then all the way through to Election Day, where we'll have a war room set up.</p><p>SEIB:  So I want to talk about Election Day and election night in a bit. </p><p>But, you know, the -- the -- there was a -- a -- an indictment this summer of a couple of Russian cyber -- cyber activists who were affiliated with the Russian military, and that indictment said there was personal data from half a million voters hacked in 2016, probably -- I'm assuming it's Illinois. Illinois thinks that's the state that was referred to. So that was an illustration:  You've got a voter data, and you've got actual voting systems, and they're not the same thing, which is probably not well understood. Which is more vulnerable, and can you protect both at the same time?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So many of the vulnerabilities or the ways in which you might attack the systems are very similar, and we see that across infrastructure. So, as many of you know, DHS has lead for security and resilience for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, and many of these tactics and techniques are the same.</p><p>What I would say about the voter databases is is that there's a lot of redundancy built in there.</p><p>Every state gives you the right to vote on a provisional ballot, those that don't allow you to do same-day registration to vote. So if there's any reason why an American should show up to voting place and be told they're not on the rolls, they can still vote. And then we'll determine if there was an issue, and sometimes those issues are operability issues. We've seen some data glitches in some of the states. It had nothing to do with security, per se, but that's why we have provisional ballots. So there's some redundancy built in there.</p><p>On the election systems themselves, what I would say is they're still very decentralized, right? So the good news is that this is not a situation where we have any indication a capability exists to, at one time, if you will, take down the voting infrastructure throughout the nation. The systems just aren't connected in that way. It would have to be a -- a very different level of attack and capability that we've seen.</p><p>But we have seen will. We have seen the capability to disrupt. And so that's what we continue to work on.</p><p>SEIB:  So -- so let me try to be a little more clear here.</p><p>As we speak today, have you seen attempts to hack into either voter databases in any of the 50 states or into the actual apparatus of casting and counting votes in any of the 50 states?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, what we've seen is continued attempts to scan, you know, to access the systems. You know, that's kind of like a burglar, you know, walking around your house and trying your windows.</p><p>In some very limited cases, we have seen access, but they have been quickly prevented or mitigated.</p><p>SEIB:  You have seen access, so people have gotten...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Not -- but not that we can attribute to a foreign country.</p><p>So this is the general -- you know, if you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure, we're under constant attack and I can't stress that enough. So what would be strange is if we didn't see any attempts.</p><p>And again, remember how the systems work. If you have an election site on your government -- e-government site, there could be lots of reasons why people are trying to access that. They could just be trying to steal, for example, people's utility information or Social Security numbers, which we also work on but might not be related to elections.</p><p>As of today, we do not have any activity that we're attributing in the election infrastructure to a foreign entity. But again that could change in an hour, so we're -- it's very dynamic and we're continuing to watch.</p><p>SEIB:  So, the president made some waves here in New York a few weeks ago when he said he's worried about Chinese interference in the 2018 midterm elections. What was he referring to?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The same thing.</p><p>So, the Chinese have a very sustained, persistent campaign through foreign influence techniques to change the way in which Americans think about China and particularly to change our policies with respect to China.</p><p>We see that in a lot of ways. We see that through news, but we also see that through the purchase of businesses. We see that through the co-opting of officials throughout the world. We've seen them very active in investment schemes -- that's what it is -- in different parts of the world where then that country's beholden for decades of debt.</p><p>So there's a very prolonged attempt.</p><p>What I would say the difference between the Chinese and the Russians, the Russians are much more brazen. They're much noisier about this. And they want to affect something here and now to disrupt American democracy and to give them and edge. The Chinese are playing a long game. They're in this for the long haul.</p><p>SEIB:  Well -- well, what you're describing is really a classic propaganda campaign, as opposed to attempts to break into and influence or gain intelligence from the voting system of the United States. Is that what really we're talking about here?</p><p>NIELSEN:  We -- again, we haven't seen any foreign influence attributed -- I just want to keep making that clear -- at the moment, but I also hesitate to give you an equivocal answer on that.</p><p>We just met with our Five Eyes partners in Australia a couple months ago. The conversation we have here about Russia, they have about China. They're very concerned about China doing what Russia did in our 2016 election in their election.</p><p>So again, China has the will. They have the capability. We haven't seen it on election infrastructure, but we have seen a very wide-ranging campaign very much targeted at the United States.</p><p>SEIB:  So, John Bolton, the national security adviser, has also talked about attempts -- or at least concerns about attempts by Iran and North Korea to also interfere in the elections. Again, what's that a reference to exactly?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, you saw -- you know, you saw Facebook take down over 80 Iranian-facing accounts over that last -- like last Friday, very recently. They were not complying with the rules of Facebook. It was \"inauthentic content\" is the phrase that Facebook used.</p><p>So again, there are a lot of countries that are trying to influence how we vote, what we think, what we think about each other, how we carry on discourse. And unfortunately now we're seeing that from Iran as well.</p><p>SEIB:  So you're really talking, again, about foreign attempts to kind of affect the atmosphere of the political conversation in this country?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes. But the issues, of course, are tied to, in some cases, parts of the -- parts of various campaigns. If you are campaigning on a particular issue and one of these countries attempts to affect the discourse on that particular issue, it is, in some cases, a clear attempt to try to manipulate the way in which voters think.</p><p>So that's the tie to the election. We're seeing it much more aggressive leading up to the election.</p><p>SEIB:  But in the cases of Iran and North Korea, you're seeing it mostly in, sort of, this dark space online in the social media spheres and darker corners of the online conversation. Is it in...</p><p>NIELSEN:  I wouldn't say -- yes...</p><p>SEIB:  ... fake personas, fake accounts, that sort of thing?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Fake personas, fake accounts. But what they have, I think they've caught onto some of our techniques. As you know, when we find a fake persona -- we the U.S. government -- share it with the platforms. We have conversations with them. If it violates their user rules, they'll pull it down.</p><p>I think the nation-states have become aware of that. So what they are doing now is they will take otherwise legitimate content by a non-nation-state actor and then they'll amplify it in a way to continue that conversation.</p><p>So it's very difficult because some of this, as you know, is protected by free speech, right? This is not terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>SEIB:  Right.</p><p>NIELSEN:  But there's a question here as to whether Americans should have the right to know who is saying what and to be able to understand the context in which a news or just commentary's provided.</p><p>SEIB:  So, in your -- in your own conversations with the big tech players in this space -- the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters -- how responsive have they been to this concern? And are you looking for more than you've gotten from them?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, there -- it could always be more. But they have been tremendous partners, and we do partner with them on a variety of areas:  everything from child exploitation to terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>We also have started to work with them on a variety of capabilities they have, through A.I. and analytics, to actually spot fake personas before we become aware of them, so it's a much more proactive. I think you've heard some of the companies say they can now pull down content -- right? -- within minutes, before anyone even sees it.</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation. We have a variety of ways in which we work with them. But they've taken a lot of leadership in this area to really not only use incoming technologies to address it, but to be very aware that this is a problem and they have no interest in having fake, disinformation campaigns posted on their platform.</p><p>SEIB:  So, let's -- let's talk a little bit about next Tuesday, Election Day itself. So...</p><p>NIELSEN:  First of all, I hope everyone is voting...</p><p>SEIB:  Very good.</p><p>NIELSEN:  ... because the very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don't vote, right? So everyone should vote. Everyone should feel confident that state and locals are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure.</p><p>There's a variety of ways in which we will then assess that after the fact, per the president's direction, with the intel community, with FBI. But I -- you know, in terms of what -- and I didn't mean to cut you off, but point number one in vote.</p><p>Point number two, you know, FBI through their ops center has set up a way in which they're connected to all of their field offices. They're poised to be ready.</p><p>We've set up a virtual war room in our National Cyber Security and Communications Integration Center. And I'll forget everybody's that's in it, because everybody's in it. We have the FBI. We have all our federal partners. We have state and local election officials. We have the Election Assistance Commission. We have the DNC. We have the RNC. We have everybody together, so that as it evolves on Election Day, we can all very quickly respond if instant response is required or if we need to communicate in a way to make sure that folks do understand what's really happening.</p><p>SEIB:  So, you mentioned earlier the bizarre characteristic about the American election system is that there isn't an American election system. There are 50, or if you count my town, the District of Columbia, 51, election systems.</p><p>That's a good thing, in the sense that you can't break into one -- you can't walk through one door and be in the whole house if you want to break into the system.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>SEIB:  On the other hand, it makes it very hard to figure out if something small has happened over here that it might be happening over there, but the person over here and the person over there don't necessarily have a way to communicate.</p><p>What have you done to fix that problem, to bring all the information together into one place? Which was a concern of a lot of state officials we talked to in 2016.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>So, bear with me for a second, because part of your answer is bureaucratic. </p><p>But we have set up all the government structures which we find is very, very important when it comes to critical infrastructure. Most of the critical infrastructure's owned by the private sector. The vendors are private. Each state does elections differently. Who's in charge of the elections can be different based county to county.</p><p>So we've set up a Government Coordinating Council, which brings the government side together; and then a Sector Coordinating Council, which brings the private sector together. That enables them to have rule-based (ph) conversations. Roles and responsibilities are clear.</p><p>And then we have worked with them to set up an Information-Sharing and Analysis Center. For those of you in the room who might be in the financial sector, you're very familiar with FS-ISAC. This is another way to do this.</p><p>But through this we can share real-time machine-to-machine threat indicators. So as something happens in one area, we can quickly share that profile of threat with all of our other partners.</p><p>It's the fastest-growing ISAC. We have all 50 states, we have over 1,300 counties working with us. It's a good news story.</p><p>But that allows that immediate sharing, that you see something, then everybody else has that essentially in their queue, in their sensors, in their network defense to look for as well.</p><p>SEIB:  And just to be clear, that didn't exist in 2016?</p><p>NIELSEN:  It did -- none of this existed in 2016 that I'm describing.</p><p>SEIB:  And so, on Election Day, let's assume that somebody in Connecticut thinks -- sees what they think was an attempt to break into the system by which people are casting and counting votes. That information goes where on Election Day? And who finds out in real time that something is happening that they ought to be on the lookout for?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So it is -- it is a voluntary partnership. And that's some thing I think -- I think is well understood at this point; that there was some confusion in 2016, there was concerns by state and locals that the federal government would somehow take over the constitutional role of state and locals to conduct elections. That's not what we're doing. It is a voluntary partnership.</p><p>But they know exactly who to call and how to send the information in a protected manner. We receive that immediately, we assess it, and then we push it back out to all the other states to protect them.</p><p>The other benefit we have now that we didn't have in 2016:  our pulling all of the information from the intel community. So, we have very advanced -- not only signatures and threat indicators from the intel community, but we also have access to their analysis and understanding in a somewhat predictive way, based on tactics of how some adversary might try to attack us in critical infrastructure. And that's at large.</p><p>But we pull all that together. They sit with us. We have many, many folks now that have clearances within the community. And those who don't, we have assured them that if we have credible actual information, we will immediately share. I'm not going to let a clearance, in that case, stand in the way. We have that information, many cases they're elected.</p><p>But we will push out that information. We did not have the mechanisms to that either in 2016.</p><p>SEIB:  Well, there's also been some question -- and again this is a bit of a bureaucratic question. But in -- in Washington there's been some question about whether funding is adequate to allow this system to really develop; will the states have the funding they need to secure their own systems, and whether there's been an adequately funded national effort to wire everything together.</p><p>Is there enough money in the system to do the kind of protective work you're talking about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we're -- you know, we're working with the -- states need to tell us that. They know that. Their working through that problem set.</p><p>We have an entire catalog -- that's literally -- literally what it is -- of services that we're offering that are completely free. They can take us up on that. We'll tailor them. We'll work with them. But it's everything from hygiene scanning, phishing training, through to very in-depth vulnerability assessments and everything in between -- exercises, awareness.</p><p>But they also have in-house, in some cases, professionals who work with them. In some cases they've hired firms from the network defender community, from cyber-security. So they have to look at all of that, look at what they have, and then we ask them to tell us to communicate with us, \"What is it that you need?\"</p><p>So, we've seen some great examples where Rhode Island, for example, has been able to budget to upgrade their systems. We've seen other states that have taken (inaudible) where the state budget has provided a tremendous amount of information -- resources, but then asked the counties to match that, so it's both levels of government in on this.</p><p>But we've also seen states like Georgia throw a flag and say, \"Gosh, we really need to update all of our aging infrastructure.\" $60 million or $80 million that they came up with, and they're not able to budget for that. </p><p>So what we've said to states is, \"Please come up with the amounts that you need, what is it that you need, and we will help you work with Congress to make sure.\"</p><p>For 2020 what I've asked is that all states have auditable systems, because at the end of the day -- and I want to be clear...</p><p>SEIB:  Which means what? What's an auditable system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  An auditable system means that when you vote, we have a way to go back after the -- after the fact to ensure that all votes were counted and were counted correctly.</p><p>There's a variety of different ways to do that. One is just paper ballots. So some states have gone back to paper ballots. It's, you know, old school, but you can count them. It's a piece of paper with your vote on it, and we can double-check that the count is correct.</p><p>Others are technology. So there are some machines where, as you vote, you can choose to essentially -- it's almost like lever that you pull, and it spits out a paper copy of your vote. You can then have access to that, and you can also give that to your polling place. Also it enables all of us to then verify that.</p><p>Many, many states have moved towards some sense of an auditable system, but there are still some counties and some states that don't have that.</p><p>SEIB:  Should there be a national standard, a national system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the national system part is difficult, because each community votes differently.</p><p>And so, what we have done is given them best practices:  \"You need to meet these types of level of security; how you then do that, we'll work with you to make sure that it meets that.\"</p><p>So it's a softer version of a hard-line regulatory standard. But nonetheless, it's:  \"These are the 10 things you have to do at minimum to make sure that (inaudible).\"</p><p>SEIB:  And are states receptive to that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah. So, we -- and actually they've been very helpful.</p><p>We also have a last-mile initiative. We've worked with the states to get to that part you had mentioned earlier, which is some of the much smaller counties are very unlikely to be resourced. So we've worked with states to go county by county and help them with an assessment on what additional activities or resources they could provide to get everybody up to speed.</p><p>SEIB:  So, I want to turn to the members for questions, but let me ask one last broader question.</p><p>And when you step back from all of this and you think about in particular the foreign actors we've been talking about, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, there are a lot of pernicious aspects to their meddling. One is that people lose confidence in the system. One is that they don't trust the results. One is that they simply don't show up to vote because they fear their vote isn't going to count.</p><p>What is your biggest concern when you think about foreign actors attempting to interfere in the election system? What's the most pernicious thing you worry about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  You know, it -- it's two things.</p><p>One, you know, this is basic cyber 101 what I'm going to say, but we've got to patch. We have to have systems configured correctly. We have to make sure that the access control and passwords are strong.</p><p>NIELSEN:  We just finished National Security -- or excuse me Cyber-Security Awareness Month. I was making the joke all month, but many people didn't seem to recognize it was joke, which is don't use \"password\" as your password. If \"Password\" is a capital P, still doesn't count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But people were actually surprised by that. \"Well, why not? You know, I've put a capital letter...\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>\"... with the word, so...\"</p><p>SEIB:  Just a 1 at the end...</p><p>NIELSEN:  That's right.</p><p>So there's more educating that we need to do on the importance of a strong partner -- passwords.</p><p>My biggest concern is that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a particular area.</p><p>And on that, we've met, we've done exercises, we've done calls with all the news agencies, anybody reporting election results. We did an exercise last Friday to help them understand these are the legitimate ways in which you can receive official results.</p><p>If you get an e-mail from someone claiming to be an election official, understand you want to get the results out as quickly as possible, but please refrain, because we cannot verify that e-mail real-time from you that it comes from an election official.</p><p>So use the predesignated ways in which you should receive and report, and of course they'll also be with us in (inaudible). If you have any questions real-time, we can work through that.</p><p>But I think we have to not jump to conclusions as Americans. Again, there are operability issues. We saw one state recently with the way they -- their machines worked pre-voting, if you didn't give it enough time to load, you tried to get through your voting very quickly and click and you wanted to do an all-party option, it wasn't really allowing you to do that. That wasn't a cyber-security issue. It was just an operability issue.</p><p>So everyone, we just need to pause, I think, election night and not jump to conclusions.</p><p>SEIB:  And the goal here if you're a foreign actor is to sow discord in the United States or to undermine the whole idea of democracy generally speaking?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I honestly think it's all of the above.</p><p>We definitely see it on the discord. We have seen them, interestingly, put material online that represents both ends of any particular issue, the full scheme, the full...</p><p>SEIB:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  They're not necessarily focused on getting you to believe X, and should you believe X or should you believe Y, if you kind of believe X, I'm going to get this -- you get my point.</p><p>But in terms of the democracy, I mean, 2016 showed us they absolutely were willing to attack the very essence of what makes our country a country, which is the sacredness of our elections. So I do think it's both.</p><p>SEIB:  With that, let me open it to the floor.</p><p>Just a couple of reminders for the members here. This is on the record. Wait for a microphone; there'll be some moving around. State your name and your affiliation. And please make it a question -- singular.</p><p>So maybe start right there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Ann Cooper, Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>You've been talking about foreign threats. The president has spoken a lot about what he considers to be a domestic threat, which is the press in this country. And I wanted to ask if you share his view that he's stated that the press is the enemy of the people.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, first let me start by saying the remark that I saw him use was \"fake news is the enemy.\" There is something to be said -- none of us want to read something that's not true.</p><p>I think relationships with the press are very important. I tend to seek opportunities to engage with them.</p><p>I can tell you from the DHS portfolio with 23 different agencies and over 240,000 employees, we do a lot and it's not well-understood.</p><p>I really value the relationship with the press to help us get information out. Certainly in disaster response the press plays an extraordinarily important role for helping us to save lives. Should we ever have an attack -- but even when we saw with the bomber and the shooter, the role that the press played was extraordinarily helpful from our perspective.</p><p>So I actually think that it's a very useful relationship from a DHS mission perspective, and one that I try to be thankful for and also find other ways to help get messages out.</p><p>SEIB:  Why don't we go here and then here?</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. David Shuman, Northwoods Capital.</p><p>Could you talk a little bit about the domestic terrorism threat and how DHS is configured to attack it; how many intelligence analysts you have working on the domestic intelligence threat?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Sure.</p><p>So one of the things that we did at DHS was we broadened our concept, first of all, of what that means. So from my perspective, hate is hate, violence is violence. It has no place in the United States.</p><p>So we've expanded our office to focus on preventing all forms of violence in the United States that are motivated by a terrorist act.</p><p>But it's not even just terrorists. It's -- you know, we look at white supremacists, we look at any ideology that lends itself or results in extreme violent behavior.</p><p>We have all of DHS focused on that. So we work with the FBI. We work with our joint terrorism task forces the FBI runs, as you know. We work through the fusion centers to push that information out. And we have very close relationships with state and local law enforcement and homeland security advisers.</p><p>The internet is -- has really made this space for us quite difficult, because in a moment like this, a terrorist or somebody who would seek to do an American harm worlds away can in a matter of seconds inspire somebody in the United States to commit an act. So we work on that.</p><p>That's a very different type of threat than what we saw, for example, in 9/11. It's very decentralized. It's much more difficult to attack. A lot of it's on the dark web. So we have a lot of capabilities we're building within the department to address it from that perspective.</p><p>But I think the only way that we win against those types of threats is by (inaudible), comprehensive, and recognizing that violence is violence and we can't stand for it.</p><p>SEIB:  Here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. I'm Paul Steiger from ProPublica.</p><p>The president has talked about mobilizing the Army to protect the borders. Talked about 5,000 troops, you know, maybe more. Do you need the Army? I mean, aren't you in a position to secure the border against a march by a couple thousand people?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, two things.</p><p>One is the -- the timing of the number of people. We're all -- I think everyone in the country is watching it to one extent or another. If they get on a train or they get on buses, they'll be here in a matter of days. If they stay on foot, they'll be here, you know, in a month or so.</p><p>So first we just have a capacity issue. When we're talking about those numbers either coming to a port of entry or trying to come between our ports of entry, no, we do not have the capacity and capability to address that type of a flow.</p><p>So what we've asked DOD to do is support us with engineering, support us with logistics, with planning. And then as a second phase, to help make sure that we can defend our ports of entry.</p><p>And that is because of what we've seen particularly in that second and third phase of the flows in Mexico that unfortunately did turn quite violent. By the time we're talking about Molotov cocktails and use of firearms, it's my duty to ensure that our (inaudible) agents are secure.</p><p>NIELSEN:  I would also note that part of our mission at DHS is to facilitate legal trade and travel. We do not want that legal trade and travel to be put at risk in any way by a mass flow of people. So it's a capacity-building, capability-building to ensure that we can continue to execute our mission.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Nina Gardner, professor of business and human rights at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington.</p><p>I wanted to ask you about family separations, and what were you thinking when you announced that policy without having a tracking system. I think our luggage at airports are taken care of more -- with more respect than the children that were separated. So I was wondering, what are you doing to reunify the children with their families now? And how do you stay up (sic) at night?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, thank you for the...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... way in which your question was asked.</p><p>I would say that at DHS, we enforce the law, and unfortunately, some parents chose to break the law and enter the country in a way that did not go to a port of entry.</p><p>We do have a tracking system. We take very good care of the children that come into our care.</p><p>The part that I really worry about, is last year we had 70,000 children dropped off at the border by smugglers and traffickers whose parents decided to send them alone on an extraordinarily dangerous journey. So we have about 13,000 of those who are in HHS care right now.</p><p>The tracking that we had, we used to ensure that families can be reunified if they do not have the ability to stay in the United States, so they can be reunited when they are removed. HHS has a tracking system to ensure that they quickly, and as fast as possible, reunite children with families or with sponsors in the United States, which, as you know, is what TVPRA requires.</p><p>In terms of reuniting on the back end, most all of the children have been reunited with families. The ones who have not, you know, we found about 80 percent of parents have now chosen for the third time that they do not want to be reunited with their children, and so those children remain in HHS care, and so HHS is trying to find safe sponsors for them and to give them good care.</p><p>When I talk to my partners in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, and I've called a couple ministerials over the past couple months -- they just came into town for a big conference -- we've really talked about, you know, how do we look at this regionally?</p><p>The goal of all of us should be to protect vulnerable populations, should be to have a system that enables us to keep families together, and should be able to ensure a safe and orderly process so that these vulnerable populations are helped as soon as possible.</p><p>The journey, as you know, is tremendously difficult and dangerous. We have about 30 percent of women who take that journey sexually abused, 17 percent of men, 70 percent of the migrants are victims of violence. So when I meet with UNHCR -- I met with the high commissioner again yesterday -- I've asked them for -- for -- since the whole time I've been secretary, \"Let's expand the asylum capacity throughout the regions so that we can help them as soon as possible on that journey, so that they're not forced to make decisions such as using a smuggler or using a trafficker, sending kids alone to the border.\"</p><p>So it's a work in progress. I'm hopeful that the partnership will continue to grow. We've had very pointed conversations on how to address that.</p><p>But you know, our -- our laws are difficult. We do need to -- and we've asked Congress to change the law so that we can keep families who choose to come here, however they come here, whether it's illegally or legally -- that we can keep them together while we process their claim.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then we'll go back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  I'm David Grupo (ph).</p><p>And you had said in your comments that the decentralization of voting systems is actually strange (ph). And you also said that you've seen the intent of a -- foreign attackers, nation attackers, and the attempt to attack and hack the systems around the country, right? But that they haven't...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Of somebody.</p><p>QUESTION:  But that they haven't succeeded, right?</p><p>And so the question is, does that then mean that your position is that the Russian state doesn't have sufficient technical skills to hack into, say, the Louisiana voting system, or a parish of Louisiana? Is that -- is that your -- is that what you're having us believe?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No.</p><p>Actually, what I said is that nation-states have demonstrated both the will and the capability to attempt to disrupt or deny our election infrastructure. That's point number one.</p><p>So if I sit here today and I don't have any intel or any information from the state and locals that they are under some sort of scanning that we can attribute to foreign countries, what I'm actually saying is, don't let that mean anything other than what that means as a moment in time. We know they have the will. We know they have the capability. We need to continue to be prepared and think about resilience and redundancy in the system.</p><p>SEIB:  Right there, and then here (ph).</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Madam Secretary, for spending time with us this morning. I'm Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.</p><p>I appreciated what you said about 70 percent of the people coming up having been victims of violence. Listening to the president's remarks last night, a reasonable person could infer that 70 percent were perpetrators of violence.</p><p>The wave of immigration coming north has been called an invasion. A logical consequence of an invasion or a violent invasion would be an armed response.</p><p>Do you agree that it's an invasion that's coming north? And when the president says we're going to treat people with rocks as though they had rifles, that caught many in the military off-guard. What do you think that does to recruiting the new generation for military service when comments like that are made?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think on the first part, you know, to put it in perspective, we are apprehending about 1,500 to 2,000 illegal entrances a day. So just to put it in perspective, that's a daily number.</p><p>The -- the challenge with the caravan is it's a very amorphous concept. You don't get a ticket to the caravan. There's not a membership program. So what we're seeing are migrants who are potentially already on the flow, choose to be in the caravan, not choose to be in the caravan. You've seen numbers reported by the press as high as 15,000. I don't think the number is that high, based on our conversations with our partners in the region.</p><p>But I think what's difficult about this flow, or different about this flow, as you've seen talked about from everyone from President Hernandez through to Secretary Navarrete in Mexico, who's my counterpart -- one of my counterparts, is that that second and third flow are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces. They are, you know, attacking the -- the federal police. They're attacking the military in Mexico. They're putting the migrants who are in the caravan who are seeking asylum at risk.</p><p>So we're trying to work with the Mexicans to protect those who are legitimately seeking asylum to make sure that they have a way to do that as soon as possible. As you know, Mexico has offered asylum to everybody traveling north right now. We all, together, are encouraging migrants to take advantage of that for their own safety.</p><p>But we've also seen criminals in this flow. We have seen gang members. When I met with my counterparts in one of the countries in the region recently, they were very concerned because they had missing children. There were kidnappings, under a false belief that if you had a child, you would be able to come into the United States and stay.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So in general, mass migrations are dangerous for the migrants themselves. It needs to be safe. It needs to be orderly. That's the best way that we can protect them.</p><p>And again, the system is broken when we're requiring somebody who's seeking asylum to travel seven weeks through very -- a very difficult process, usually at the hands of smugglers.</p><p>So, we're working with UNHCR, working with the region to try to make sure that we can help those populations much sooner.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good morning. Thanks for being here. I'm Nili Gilbert from Matarin Capital.</p><p>I wonder how do you see the U.S. electorate and the major pressures on our country 30 or 40 years from now? And if you had to build a long-term strategic plan for the Republican Party, how would it respond to those pressures? And how is the party moving towards that today?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the one good news is that, despite the myriad of missions that we have at DHS, I do not have to do that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So I would respectfully just refer you to the RNC. We don't -- we -- national security is bipartisan. Homeland Security is bipartisan. I don't get into the politics of it. We're just trying to secure the homeland. So respectfully I wouldn't have any comment on that.</p><p>What I can tell you is, from a Homeland Security perspective, what I really worry about is how quickly the threats are morphing and that perhaps our defenses are lagging behind. So part of what I feel very strongly is my responsibility is to make sure that DHS is resourced, that they have the tools they need and they have the authorities they need to combat these new threats.</p><p>So, for example, I'll give you a quick one, as you know, we just received authority to address the risk of nefarious unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States. We see them real-time dropping drugs and other illicit materials across the border. We see them surveilling sensitive locations. We have seen them weaponized throughout theaters -- theaters of war as close as Mexico. We've seen them armed with grenades. But we did not have the authority until about two weeks ago to either monitor or identify or interdict a drone that had a nefarious purpose in the United States.</p><p>So I think we have to have a system that's much more flexible. I encourage everyone at DHS to get on their toes, be really forward-thinking, double-down on the threats we know today, but really do that horizon-scanning and think about what is emerging so that we can make sure that we're prepared for it.</p><p>So that's my strategy in that sense. We call it relentless resilience, mixed with partnership, to make sure that we can cover down on all the threats we have in the homeland.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then over here next.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Paula DiPerna, NTR Foundation. Thank you for being here.</p><p>Back to issue of the military, regardless of the capacity issue and all the threats you've just described, it does feel like militarization of the Homeland Security -- militarization of our borders. And so, at what point would the military, say, be authorized to shoot to kill on the border? And who would authorize that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the military -- of course, I would defer you to DOD for their rules of engagement.</p><p>But the military, of course, has always been allowed -- provided the opportunity to defend themselves, just as my Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers.</p><p>Our rules of engagement are published online. We're very transparent about what we do at the border and how we engage. I can't really speak more to DOD, but -- but our agents and officers are very clear.</p><p>I would say that assaults on our officers have gone -- continue to go up in some sectors. We had over 800 instances last year where they were attacked by those coming across the border. I do take their safety very seriously. </p><p>But again our rules of engagement are transparent and clear and are posted online.</p><p>SEIB:  I think we're going there next, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, I thank you for being here. I'm Neil Christian (ph) from Veritas Capital.</p><p>When the president started talking initially about a wall, I always thought it was a metaphor for increased border security. And as time is going on, he actually seems to be talking about a real, concrete border wall on the southern border.</p><p>And I really appreciate all your eloquent responses today. I'd really love to hear whether you believe that would -- if he's actually talking about a physical wall that will go up, and whether that's an effective way to protect the southern border.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think what we need is a wall system. So, we need some sort of infrastructure. We need personnel and we need technology. And we continue to look a whole variety of technological uses, including drones in a positive way, to make sure that we have situational awareness of that border.</p><p>What I would tell you is in some of the areas at our border -- and all the border areas are quite different, first of all -- I mean, some is in the middle of the desert, some near natural barriers such as rivers, but some abut directly onto cities on both sides.</p><p>There's a term we use for that which is called vanishing time. The difficulty there is somebody can cross the border and disappear, either side, into an urban environment in a matter of minutes.</p><p>So the concept of impedance and denial becomes very important. And the first and foremost way to do that is to have an infrastructure of some sort that slows them down, that gives us the opportunity to detect an illegal entry, but also hopefully it deters them from attempting it to begin with. If they have a legitimate need to come, go to a port of entry. And if they don't have a legitimate need to come -- this particularly we see a lot of unfortunate traffic that way of the smugglers, the traffickers and the transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>So, I think that there's a combination. The president has been clear we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea, but there are some areas where that impedance and denial is the difference between being able to secure the border and not being able to secure the border. But its only one part, and that's why I say we also need the personnel and technology, the sensors, the lights, the roads, the ability to apprehend, and the ability to have that situational awareness all across the border.</p><p>SEIB:  There, and then back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Patricia Rosenfield, Rosenfield Fund.</p><p>I also want to thank you very much for this very clear and eloquent meeting. But I wanted to ask about a more perhaps conceptual concern I have, and that is the pervasiveness of fear and lack of confidence in the democratic system that we know. It certainly (ph) seems to be such an issue that might prevent voting as we've talked about. But also fear (inaudible) the caravan, other issues that might require a stronger partnership with local community organizations and nonprofits, foundations, you seem to have a very effective system for intergovernmental coordination, even with local level actors internationally.</p><p>Just wondering how are you in department reaching out to the local -- to citizens?</p><p>You said that Homeland Security is not that well understood. So I'm just wondering how are you doing that? How are you working that? How are you reaching out to the -- not the corporate but the nongovernmental nonprofit sector? And how is that working? And what could be done to make it stronger?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, so that is a great question.</p><p>You know, as I mentioned, everything we do at DHS we have to do in partnership because no one entity can address all these threats.</p><p>I'll give you an example on immigration.</p><p>So I have personally, as have my component heads, been in very close contact with many NGOs, with foundations. We've asked them to be part of the conversation. We've brought them into various conferences we've had within the Northern Triangle. They play an extraordinarily important role, not just for taking care of the vulnerable populations as they travel, but also working with us in communities, both for receiving those who are coming here to claim asylum, as well as for those who are being repatriated back to the countries.</p><p>So the first ladies, particular of Guatemala, but Honduras as well, are very active. I, with them, also have conversations with the NGO community. We've asked the foundations to -- to step up. We've asked them, you know, \"What -- what additional role are you willing to play? How can you help us get additional resources to these populations? How can you help us message to them about the right way to do things?\" For example, in this particular instance, to help them understand what Mexico is offering, in terms of jobs and asylum, so that we can limit the violence on those populations.</p><p>So it's a very important role, and then I could, kind of, go through each mission set at DHS and the role they play. But I think more and more, the communities -- you know, we say \"hometown security.\" If we don't have hometown security, we don't have homeland security.</p><p>So again, immigration is an example. I meet with the ranchers, I meet with the sheriffs, I meet with the landowners to try to understand what they're seeing. What are their environments like? What are they concerned about? What can we do better, in partnership with them, to protect their constituents, as they do that every day as part of their main mission.</p><p>So I think that's crucial. I don't know that we necessarily had leveraged that community as well as we needed to in the past. So it's a very clear focus right now, particularly with respect to the human rights situation, and how we can really work with them and -- and learn from their expertise.</p><p>SEIB:  Can I just ask one quick follow-up?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah.</p><p>SEIB:  You -- you've mentioned a couple of times your conversations with your Central American colleagues. Are they doing enough, in your estimation, to actually reduce the flow -- the outflow of -- of migrants?</p><p>NIELSEN:  They are -- it's a capacity issue. Nobody is really generally -- has the capacity for these numbers that we're talking about. But they're working very hard.</p><p>We have -- we're in daily contact with all of the countries. We roll up what they're doing. They're trying a variety of different tactics and techniques in their communities to provide for those who would otherwise choose to leave.</p><p>We have been very interested in some of the U.N. data that has come out, for example, that says that many of the migrants that make their way into the United States do so because of lack of food. And so we work with the countries to find out, \"Well, how can we address that more systemically?\"</p><p>And at the end of the day, it's about building prosperity and stability in the region. So we've brought the private sector in. I've spent a lot of time talking to American companies about how, and would they consider investing further in the area. We've been working very closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to the same end.</p><p>But we -- we have to make it so that migration is -- is a choice; it's not believed by anyone to be a need. So that's, you know, ensuring that they have opportunity and -- and what they need in the region.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then probably this will be our last question there.</p><p>QUESTION:  My name's Phyllis Costanza, and I'm with UBS Optimus Foundation.</p><p>And I think a lot of resources for foundations, coming back to your point, are being spent on rehabilitation of children who are traumatized. And what's important is this issue of prevention; not having to put resources into rehabilitating children.</p><p>So how are you working, specifically with organizations like USAID and other government entities, to prevent, in the first place, children from being traumatized?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah, I mean, I think a -- a couple different ways.</p><p>The goal is -- as you know, with aid, is to do it in a targeted way with metrics so that we can then scale it and expand it if something works, or we can revise it and retarget it if it didn't produce the results that we wanted.</p><p>So the conversation to be had with USAID and the Alliance for Prosperity in general are very much about what's working, what's working from the local perspective, and how can we expand that.</p><p>We've seen some very interesting programs out of the Northern Triangle using USAID funding, for example, to have micro-competitions -- business competitions. And if you win the competition, you will receive $12,000, which is the -- which is tied to and is that same amount in that area that you would pay a smuggler to come to the United States.</p><p>So we're trying to provide additional opportunity there as an alternative and to help them understand that they have another alternative.</p><p>But the -- the conversation needs to continue to evolve. You know, what is the best way, what are the actual push factors in the region, and how can we -- again, it's stabilization, it's building prosperity, economic opportunity, continuing to help them reduce violence.</p><p>We've seen some very good news statistics on decreases in murder rates in particular parts of the Northern Triangle. Everybody needs to do more to get those numbers down even lower. So what can we do there to help build capacity, for example, for law enforcement to help ensure that there's a safe environment?</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation, but I think what we're doing is learning from the foundations who are also there on the ground what is it that you're seeing and what works and what can we be doing to help the region?</p><p>SEIB:  So final question right there. Wait a second. There you go.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Daniel Holtzman, Bank of America.</p><p>In the 2019 budget, you asked for almost a billion dollars, or a 10 percent increase, 3,300 people, 52,000 beds. Is -- what -- is -- what -- why do we still need the Army with increases like that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, as you might know, there's a difference between a request -- requesting an appropriation and having an appropriation. We don't have an appropriation at DHS yet. We're still in a continued resolution. So we are hopeful that Congress will pass an appropriation in December.</p><p>The key to this issue at the end of the day is to be able to apprehend those who do not have a legal right, to detain them and then to very quickly process them.</p><p>And expeditious processing is important, because the system is so backlogged that when you have somebody who is within our country for many, many years, it complicates the ability for us to remove them. They've likely now have roots in the community. We don't always have the ability to know where they are if they fail to appear for a variety of engagements that are preplanned, predesignated notices to appear to courts, et cetera.</p><p>So the key is to apprehend those who do not have a legal right to stay, be able to detain them, to keep them in a process with the courts that is very expedited.</p><p>And again, I don't mean to get into too much detail. This is extraordinarily complicated. But the detained docket goes much more quickly than the non-detained docket.</p><p>So the fastest way to process through our system is to be detained, so the courts will very quickly hear your case adjudicated. And then the court, of course, makes the decision to deport, not DHS. The court will give us a final order of removal for a particular person and then we seek to remove them.</p><p>So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. One is trying to address a potential massive flow that could be here in a number of days, and the other is a more systemic issue that we need to work with Congress on to address those pull factors.</p><p>Again, as I mentioned, we want to be able to keep families together. We want to be able to treat non-Mexicans the same as we treat Mexicans. There's different legal procedures for different nationalities right now that adds a lot of complexity to the system. Many who arrive at our border don't have paperwork, so we want to make sure we do that.</p><p>And then with UACs, we want to -- sorry, unaccompanied children -- we want to make sure that we can take care of them as quickly as possible in the best way possible. And there's some limits on how we can do that with that 13,000 that we have now.</p><p>So we've asked for some very specific fixes of Congress. That's the legislative side. We have the appropriations side. Then we have the immediate potential surge right now that we're trying to make sure we're prepared for.</p><p>SEIB:  So, we've reached the 9 o'clock hour. I will say you live in interesting times.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Thank you for coming in, sharing with us today.</p><p>NIELSEN:  My pleasure. My pleasure.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2128026608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVS-GS51-JBHT-D1WR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9289\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 2, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Bureau of Investigation--FBI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Illinois</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nielsen, Kirstjen</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>International relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Infrastructure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Councils</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National security</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 922120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p>SEIB:  I'm Jerry Seib, Washington -- executive Washington editor of the Wall Street Journal. I'm the moderator today, and I'll be presiding.</p><p>You know, the topic of today's conversation, as we agreed initially, is cyber-security and safeguarding U.S. elections, which we'll talk about because it's very timely, and -- and as we were just discussing, of broad significance around the country. There are some other issues. Border issues probably will come up. But we'll have plenty of time in the audience Q&amp;A to deal with issues beyond -- beyond cyber-security and elections.</p><p>But again, thank you for being here.</p><p>Let's talk about elections, because we are, as we speak, four days from what I think is a very charged and high-stakes election. Can Americans be confident their votes will count, that the system will hold, that there won't be interference, and that there won't be problems on Election Day?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, first of all, I just say we actually have an even higher bar.</p><p>SEIB:  OK.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we want to make sure that everyone's vote is counted, but is also counted correctly.</p><p>So as many of you know, there were concerns that proved unfounded, but as we see throughout the rest of the world with some of the attempts to hack the election infrastructure, there's also concern about the integrity. So we want to vote to count, we want it counted correctly.</p><p>What (inaudible), this is going to be the most secure election we've ever had. But as we all know, with this dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.</p><p>So as of today, we don't have any -- any indication that a foreign government has a sustained effort or a sustained plan to hack our election infrastructure. But having said that, the moment it changes, we, of course, will let our state and local partners know.</p><p>SEIB:  So, you know, you have said that the Russians probably attempted in 2016 to gain access to voting systems in all 50 states.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.</p><p>SEIB:  And they were, in fact, successful in a couple of cases. What are they doing now? And what did you learn from that 2016 experience?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah, so I think there's -- if I could, let me just back up and divide it into a couple different threats.</p><p>So the threat that DHS focuses on is any interference into the election infrastructure. So we work with our state and local partners, election officials, the Election Assistance Commission; I can go into a variety of other groups that we work with. But what we're trying to make sure is that that infrastructure, the voting -- the voter databases, the polling infrastructure, the voting machines are all secure.</p><p>The other threat, though, that we're facing, which is much more difficult to get our hands around, is the very pernicious attempts at influence by foreign governments. And this takes a variety of means. FBI has lead on that.</p><p>That's much more difficult. A lot of that, at the end of the day, is about educating the American public to think -- to think about what you're reading, think about the source, think about where it's coming from.</p><p>R.T., as you know, which is a self-proclaimed state agent of Russia, if you can believe it, in 2017 had more views on YouTube than CNN -- double the -- double amount of views. But that is a directly state-sponsored news agency.</p><p>So the -- that is much more difficult to combat. And that's China, that's Russia. We see that with Iran. We see the recent tape -- takedowns from Facebook.</p><p>So that's the FBI lead we support. I think we need to continue, as a country, to figure out how to combat that part.</p><p>But the election infrastructure, we've done a tremendous amount at the front end of training, and then all the way through to Election Day, where we'll have a war room set up.</p><p>SEIB:  So I want to talk about Election Day and election night in a bit. </p><p>But, you know, the -- the -- there was a -- a -- an indictment this summer of a couple of Russian cyber -- cyber activists who were affiliated with the Russian military, and that indictment said there was personal data from half a million voters hacked in 2016, probably -- I'm assuming it's Illinois. Illinois thinks that's the state that was referred to. So that was an illustration:  You've got a voter data, and you've got actual voting systems, and they're not the same thing, which is probably not well understood. Which is more vulnerable, and can you protect both at the same time?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So many of the vulnerabilities or the ways in which you might attack the systems are very similar, and we see that across infrastructure. So, as many of you know, DHS has lead for security and resilience for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, and many of these tactics and techniques are the same.</p><p>What I would say about the voter databases is is that there's a lot of redundancy built in there.</p><p>Every state gives you the right to vote on a provisional ballot, those that don't allow you to do same-day registration to vote. So if there's any reason why an American should show up to voting place and be told they're not on the rolls, they can still vote. And then we'll determine if there was an issue, and sometimes those issues are operability issues. We've seen some data glitches in some of the states. It had nothing to do with security, per se, but that's why we have provisional ballots. So there's some redundancy built in there.</p><p>On the election systems themselves, what I would say is they're still very decentralized, right? So the good news is that this is not a situation where we have any indication a capability exists to, at one time, if you will, take down the voting infrastructure throughout the nation. The systems just aren't connected in that way. It would have to be a -- a very different level of attack and capability that we've seen.</p><p>But we have seen will. We have seen the capability to disrupt. And so that's what we continue to work on.</p><p>SEIB:  So -- so let me try to be a little more clear here.</p><p>As we speak today, have you seen attempts to hack into either voter databases in any of the 50 states or into the actual apparatus of casting and counting votes in any of the 50 states?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, what we've seen is continued attempts to scan, you know, to access the systems. You know, that's kind of like a burglar, you know, walking around your house and trying your windows.</p><p>In some very limited cases, we have seen access, but they have been quickly prevented or mitigated.</p><p>SEIB:  You have seen access, so people have gotten...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Not -- but not that we can attribute to a foreign country.</p><p>So this is the general -- you know, if you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure, we're under constant attack and I can't stress that enough. So what would be strange is if we didn't see any attempts.</p><p>And again, remember how the systems work. If you have an election site on your government -- e-government site, there could be lots of reasons why people are trying to access that. They could just be trying to steal, for example, people's utility information or Social Security numbers, which we also work on but might not be related to elections.</p><p>As of today, we do not have any activity that we're attributing in the election infrastructure to a foreign entity. But again that could change in an hour, so we're -- it's very dynamic and we're continuing to watch.</p><p>SEIB:  So, the president made some waves here in New York a few weeks ago when he said he's worried about Chinese interference in the 2018 midterm elections. What was he referring to?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The same thing.</p><p>So, the Chinese have a very sustained, persistent campaign through foreign influence techniques to change the way in which Americans think about China and particularly to change our policies with respect to China.</p><p>We see that in a lot of ways. We see that through news, but we also see that through the purchase of businesses. We see that through the co-opting of officials throughout the world. We've seen them very active in investment schemes -- that's what it is -- in different parts of the world where then that country's beholden for decades of debt.</p><p>So there's a very prolonged attempt.</p><p>What I would say the difference between the Chinese and the Russians, the Russians are much more brazen. They're much noisier about this. And they want to affect something here and now to disrupt American democracy and to give them and edge. The Chinese are playing a long game. They're in this for the long haul.</p><p>SEIB:  Well -- well, what you're describing is really a classic propaganda campaign, as opposed to attempts to break into and influence or gain intelligence from the voting system of the United States. Is that what really we're talking about here?</p><p>NIELSEN:  We -- again, we haven't seen any foreign influence attributed -- I just want to keep making that clear -- at the moment, but I also hesitate to give you an equivocal answer on that.</p><p>We just met with our Five Eyes partners in Australia a couple months ago. The conversation we have here about Russia, they have about China. They're very concerned about China doing what Russia did in our 2016 election in their election.</p><p>So again, China has the will. They have the capability. We haven't seen it on election infrastructure, but we have seen a very wide-ranging campaign very much targeted at the United States.</p><p>SEIB:  So, John Bolton, the national security adviser, has also talked about attempts -- or at least concerns about attempts by Iran and North Korea to also interfere in the elections. Again, what's that a reference to exactly?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, you saw -- you know, you saw Facebook take down over 80 Iranian-facing accounts over that last -- like last Friday, very recently. They were not complying with the rules of Facebook. It was \"inauthentic content\" is the phrase that Facebook used.</p><p>So again, there are a lot of countries that are trying to influence how we vote, what we think, what we think about each other, how we carry on discourse. And unfortunately now we're seeing that from Iran as well.</p><p>SEIB:  So you're really talking, again, about foreign attempts to kind of affect the atmosphere of the political conversation in this country?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes. But the issues, of course, are tied to, in some cases, parts of the -- parts of various campaigns. If you are campaigning on a particular issue and one of these countries attempts to affect the discourse on that particular issue, it is, in some cases, a clear attempt to try to manipulate the way in which voters think.</p><p>So that's the tie to the election. We're seeing it much more aggressive leading up to the election.</p><p>SEIB:  But in the cases of Iran and North Korea, you're seeing it mostly in, sort of, this dark space online in the social media spheres and darker corners of the online conversation. Is it in...</p><p>NIELSEN:  I wouldn't say -- yes...</p><p>SEIB:  ... fake personas, fake accounts, that sort of thing?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Fake personas, fake accounts. But what they have, I think they've caught onto some of our techniques. As you know, when we find a fake persona -- we the U.S. government -- share it with the platforms. We have conversations with them. If it violates their user rules, they'll pull it down.</p><p>I think the nation-states have become aware of that. So what they are doing now is they will take otherwise legitimate content by a non-nation-state actor and then they'll amplify it in a way to continue that conversation.</p><p>So it's very difficult because some of this, as you know, is protected by free speech, right? This is not terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>SEIB:  Right.</p><p>NIELSEN:  But there's a question here as to whether Americans should have the right to know who is saying what and to be able to understand the context in which a news or just commentary's provided.</p><p>SEIB:  So, in your -- in your own conversations with the big tech players in this space -- the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters -- how responsive have they been to this concern? And are you looking for more than you've gotten from them?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, there -- it could always be more. But they have been tremendous partners, and we do partner with them on a variety of areas:  everything from child exploitation to terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>We also have started to work with them on a variety of capabilities they have, through A.I. and analytics, to actually spot fake personas before we become aware of them, so it's a much more proactive. I think you've heard some of the companies say they can now pull down content -- right? -- within minutes, before anyone even sees it.</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation. We have a variety of ways in which we work with them. But they've taken a lot of leadership in this area to really not only use incoming technologies to address it, but to be very aware that this is a problem and they have no interest in having fake, disinformation campaigns posted on their platform.</p><p>SEIB:  So, let's -- let's talk a little bit about next Tuesday, Election Day itself. So...</p><p>NIELSEN:  First of all, I hope everyone is voting...</p><p>SEIB:  Very good.</p><p>NIELSEN:  ... because the very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don't vote, right? So everyone should vote. Everyone should feel confident that state and locals are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure.</p><p>There's a variety of ways in which we will then assess that after the fact, per the president's direction, with the intel community, with FBI. But I -- you know, in terms of what -- and I didn't mean to cut you off, but point number one in vote.</p><p>Point number two, you know, FBI through their ops center has set up a way in which they're connected to all of their field offices. They're poised to be ready.</p><p>We've set up a virtual war room in our National Cyber Security and Communications Integration Center. And I'll forget everybody's that's in it, because everybody's in it. We have the FBI. We have all our federal partners. We have state and local election officials. We have the Election Assistance Commission. We have the DNC. We have the RNC. We have everybody together, so that as it evolves on Election Day, we can all very quickly respond if instant response is required or if we need to communicate in a way to make sure that folks do understand what's really happening.</p><p>SEIB:  So, you mentioned earlier the bizarre characteristic about the American election system is that there isn't an American election system. There are 50, or if you count my town, the District of Columbia, 51, election systems.</p><p>That's a good thing, in the sense that you can't break into one -- you can't walk through one door and be in the whole house if you want to break into the system.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>SEIB:  On the other hand, it makes it very hard to figure out if something small has happened over here that it might be happening over there, but the person over here and the person over there don't necessarily have a way to communicate.</p><p>What have you done to fix that problem, to bring all the information together into one place? Which was a concern of a lot of state officials we talked to in 2016.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>So, bear with me for a second, because part of your answer is bureaucratic. </p><p>But we have set up all the government structures which we find is very, very important when it comes to critical infrastructure. Most of the critical infrastructure's owned by the private sector. The vendors are private. Each state does elections differently. Who's in charge of the elections can be different based county to county.</p><p>So we've set up a Government Coordinating Council, which brings the government side together; and then a Sector Coordinating Council, which brings the private sector together. That enables them to have rule-based (ph) conversations. Roles and responsibilities are clear.</p><p>And then we have worked with them to set up an Information-Sharing and Analysis Center. For those of you in the room who might be in the financial sector, you're very familiar with FS-ISAC. This is another way to do this.</p><p>But through this we can share real-time machine-to-machine threat indicators. So as something happens in one area, we can quickly share that profile of threat with all of our other partners.</p><p>It's the fastest-growing ISAC. We have all 50 states, we have over 1,300 counties working with us. It's a good news story.</p><p>But that allows that immediate sharing, that you see something, then everybody else has that essentially in their queue, in their sensors, in their network defense to look for as well.</p><p>SEIB:  And just to be clear, that didn't exist in 2016?</p><p>NIELSEN:  It did -- none of this existed in 2016 that I'm describing.</p><p>SEIB:  And so, on Election Day, let's assume that somebody in Connecticut thinks -- sees what they think was an attempt to break into the system by which people are casting and counting votes. That information goes where on Election Day? And who finds out in real time that something is happening that they ought to be on the lookout for?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So it is -- it is a voluntary partnership. And that's some thing I think -- I think is well understood at this point; that there was some confusion in 2016, there was concerns by state and locals that the federal government would somehow take over the constitutional role of state and locals to conduct elections. That's not what we're doing. It is a voluntary partnership.</p><p>But they know exactly who to call and how to send the information in a protected manner. We receive that immediately, we assess it, and then we push it back out to all the other states to protect them.</p><p>The other benefit we have now that we didn't have in 2016:  our pulling all of the information from the intel community. So, we have very advanced -- not only signatures and threat indicators from the intel community, but we also have access to their analysis and understanding in a somewhat predictive way, based on tactics of how some adversary might try to attack us in critical infrastructure. And that's at large.</p><p>But we pull all that together. They sit with us. We have many, many folks now that have clearances within the community. And those who don't, we have assured them that if we have credible actual information, we will immediately share. I'm not going to let a clearance, in that case, stand in the way. We have that information, many cases they're elected.</p><p>But we will push out that information. We did not have the mechanisms to that either in 2016.</p><p>SEIB:  Well, there's also been some question -- and again this is a bit of a bureaucratic question. But in -- in Washington there's been some question about whether funding is adequate to allow this system to really develop; will the states have the funding they need to secure their own systems, and whether there's been an adequately funded national effort to wire everything together.</p><p>Is there enough money in the system to do the kind of protective work you're talking about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we're -- you know, we're working with the -- states need to tell us that. They know that. Their working through that problem set.</p><p>We have an entire catalog -- that's literally -- literally what it is -- of services that we're offering that are completely free. They can take us up on that. We'll tailor them. We'll work with them. But it's everything from hygiene scanning, phishing training, through to very in-depth vulnerability assessments and everything in between -- exercises, awareness.</p><p>But they also have in-house, in some cases, professionals who work with them. In some cases they've hired firms from the network defender community, from cyber-security. So they have to look at all of that, look at what they have, and then we ask them to tell us to communicate with us, \"What is it that you need?\"</p><p>So, we've seen some great examples where Rhode Island, for example, has been able to budget to upgrade their systems. We've seen other states that have taken (inaudible) where the state budget has provided a tremendous amount of information -- resources, but then asked the counties to match that, so it's both levels of government in on this.</p><p>But we've also seen states like Georgia throw a flag and say, \"Gosh, we really need to update all of our aging infrastructure.\" $60 million or $80 million that they came up with, and they're not able to budget for that. </p><p>So what we've said to states is, \"Please come up with the amounts that you need, what is it that you need, and we will help you work with Congress to make sure.\"</p><p>For 2020 what I've asked is that all states have auditable systems, because at the end of the day -- and I want to be clear...</p><p>SEIB:  Which means what? What's an auditable system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  An auditable system means that when you vote, we have a way to go back after the -- after the fact to ensure that all votes were counted and were counted correctly.</p><p>There's a variety of different ways to do that. One is just paper ballots. So some states have gone back to paper ballots. It's, you know, old school, but you can count them. It's a piece of paper with your vote on it, and we can double-check that the count is correct.</p><p>Others are technology. So there are some machines where, as you vote, you can choose to essentially -- it's almost like lever that you pull, and it spits out a paper copy of your vote. You can then have access to that, and you can also give that to your polling place. Also it enables all of us to then verify that.</p><p>Many, many states have moved towards some sense of an auditable system, but there are still some counties and some states that don't have that.</p><p>SEIB:  Should there be a national standard, a national system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the national system part is difficult, because each community votes differently.</p><p>And so, what we have done is given them best practices:  \"You need to meet these types of level of security; how you then do that, we'll work with you to make sure that it meets that.\"</p><p>So it's a softer version of a hard-line regulatory standard. But nonetheless, it's:  \"These are the 10 things you have to do at minimum to make sure that (inaudible).\"</p><p>SEIB:  And are states receptive to that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah. So, we -- and actually they've been very helpful.</p><p>We also have a last-mile initiative. We've worked with the states to get to that part you had mentioned earlier, which is some of the much smaller counties are very unlikely to be resourced. So we've worked with states to go county by county and help them with an assessment on what additional activities or resources they could provide to get everybody up to speed.</p><p>SEIB:  So, I want to turn to the members for questions, but let me ask one last broader question.</p><p>And when you step back from all of this and you think about in particular the foreign actors we've been talking about, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, there are a lot of pernicious aspects to their meddling. One is that people lose confidence in the system. One is that they don't trust the results. One is that they simply don't show up to vote because they fear their vote isn't going to count.</p><p>What is your biggest concern when you think about foreign actors attempting to interfere in the election system? What's the most pernicious thing you worry about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  You know, it -- it's two things.</p><p>One, you know, this is basic cyber 101 what I'm going to say, but we've got to patch. We have to have systems configured correctly. We have to make sure that the access control and passwords are strong.</p><p>NIELSEN:  We just finished National Security -- or excuse me Cyber-Security Awareness Month. I was making the joke all month, but many people didn't seem to recognize it was joke, which is don't use \"password\" as your password. If \"Password\" is a capital P, still doesn't count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But people were actually surprised by that. \"Well, why not? You know, I've put a capital letter...\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>\"... with the word, so...\"</p><p>SEIB:  Just a 1 at the end...</p><p>NIELSEN:  That's right.</p><p>So there's more educating that we need to do on the importance of a strong partner -- passwords.</p><p>My biggest concern is that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a particular area.</p><p>And on that, we've met, we've done exercises, we've done calls with all the news agencies, anybody reporting election results. We did an exercise last Friday to help them understand these are the legitimate ways in which you can receive official results.</p><p>If you get an e-mail from someone claiming to be an election official, understand you want to get the results out as quickly as possible, but please refrain, because we cannot verify that e-mail real-time from you that it comes from an election official.</p><p>So use the predesignated ways in which you should receive and report, and of course they'll also be with us in (inaudible). If you have any questions real-time, we can work through that.</p><p>But I think we have to not jump to conclusions as Americans. Again, there are operability issues. We saw one state recently with the way they -- their machines worked pre-voting, if you didn't give it enough time to load, you tried to get through your voting very quickly and click and you wanted to do an all-party option, it wasn't really allowing you to do that. That wasn't a cyber-security issue. It was just an operability issue.</p><p>So everyone, we just need to pause, I think, election night and not jump to conclusions.</p><p>SEIB:  And the goal here if you're a foreign actor is to sow discord in the United States or to undermine the whole idea of democracy generally speaking?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I honestly think it's all of the above.</p><p>We definitely see it on the discord. We have seen them, interestingly, put material online that represents both ends of any particular issue, the full scheme, the full...</p><p>SEIB:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  They're not necessarily focused on getting you to believe X, and should you believe X or should you believe Y, if you kind of believe X, I'm going to get this -- you get my point.</p><p>But in terms of the democracy, I mean, 2016 showed us they absolutely were willing to attack the very essence of what makes our country a country, which is the sacredness of our elections. So I do think it's both.</p><p>SEIB:  With that, let me open it to the floor.</p><p>Just a couple of reminders for the members here. This is on the record. Wait for a microphone; there'll be some moving around. State your name and your affiliation. And please make it a question -- singular.</p><p>So maybe start right there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Ann Cooper, Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>You've been talking about foreign threats. The president has spoken a lot about what he considers to be a domestic threat, which is the press in this country. And I wanted to ask if you share his view that he's stated that the press is the enemy of the people.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, first let me start by saying the remark that I saw him use was \"fake news is the enemy.\" There is something to be said -- none of us want to read something that's not true.</p><p>I think relationships with the press are very important. I tend to seek opportunities to engage with them.</p><p>I can tell you from the DHS portfolio with 23 different agencies and over 240,000 employees, we do a lot and it's not well-understood.</p><p>I really value the relationship with the press to help us get information out. Certainly in disaster response the press plays an extraordinarily important role for helping us to save lives. Should we ever have an attack -- but even when we saw with the bomber and the shooter, the role that the press played was extraordinarily helpful from our perspective.</p><p>So I actually think that it's a very useful relationship from a DHS mission perspective, and one that I try to be thankful for and also find other ways to help get messages out.</p><p>SEIB:  Why don't we go here and then here?</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. David Shuman, Northwoods Capital.</p><p>Could you talk a little bit about the domestic terrorism threat and how DHS is configured to attack it; how many intelligence analysts you have working on the domestic intelligence threat?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Sure.</p><p>So one of the things that we did at DHS was we broadened our concept, first of all, of what that means. So from my perspective, hate is hate, violence is violence. It has no place in the United States.</p><p>So we've expanded our office to focus on preventing all forms of violence in the United States that are motivated by a terrorist act.</p><p>But it's not even just terrorists. It's -- you know, we look at white supremacists, we look at any ideology that lends itself or results in extreme violent behavior.</p><p>We have all of DHS focused on that. So we work with the FBI. We work with our joint terrorism task forces the FBI runs, as you know. We work through the fusion centers to push that information out. And we have very close relationships with state and local law enforcement and homeland security advisers.</p><p>The internet is -- has really made this space for us quite difficult, because in a moment like this, a terrorist or somebody who would seek to do an American harm worlds away can in a matter of seconds inspire somebody in the United States to commit an act. So we work on that.</p><p>That's a very different type of threat than what we saw, for example, in 9/11. It's very decentralized. It's much more difficult to attack. A lot of it's on the dark web. So we have a lot of capabilities we're building within the department to address it from that perspective.</p><p>But I think the only way that we win against those types of threats is by (inaudible), comprehensive, and recognizing that violence is violence and we can't stand for it.</p><p>SEIB:  Here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. I'm Paul Steiger from ProPublica.</p><p>The president has talked about mobilizing the Army to protect the borders. Talked about 5,000 troops, you know, maybe more. Do you need the Army? I mean, aren't you in a position to secure the border against a march by a couple thousand people?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, two things.</p><p>One is the -- the timing of the number of people. We're all -- I think everyone in the country is watching it to one extent or another. If they get on a train or they get on buses, they'll be here in a matter of days. If they stay on foot, they'll be here, you know, in a month or so.</p><p>So first we just have a capacity issue. When we're talking about those numbers either coming to a port of entry or trying to come between our ports of entry, no, we do not have the capacity and capability to address that type of a flow.</p><p>So what we've asked DOD to do is support us with engineering, support us with logistics, with planning. And then as a second phase, to help make sure that we can defend our ports of entry.</p><p>And that is because of what we've seen particularly in that second and third phase of the flows in Mexico that unfortunately did turn quite violent. By the time we're talking about Molotov cocktails and use of firearms, it's my duty to ensure that our (inaudible) agents are secure.</p><p>NIELSEN:  I would also note that part of our mission at DHS is to facilitate legal trade and travel. We do not want that legal trade and travel to be put at risk in any way by a mass flow of people. So it's a capacity-building, capability-building to ensure that we can continue to execute our mission.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Nina Gardner, professor of business and human rights at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington.</p><p>I wanted to ask you about family separations, and what were you thinking when you announced that policy without having a tracking system. I think our luggage at airports are taken care of more -- with more respect than the children that were separated. So I was wondering, what are you doing to reunify the children with their families now? And how do you stay up (sic) at night?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, thank you for the...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... way in which your question was asked.</p><p>I would say that at DHS, we enforce the law, and unfortunately, some parents chose to break the law and enter the country in a way that did not go to a port of entry.</p><p>We do have a tracking system. We take very good care of the children that come into our care.</p><p>The part that I really worry about, is last year we had 70,000 children dropped off at the border by smugglers and traffickers whose parents decided to send them alone on an extraordinarily dangerous journey. So we have about 13,000 of those who are in HHS care right now.</p><p>The tracking that we had, we used to ensure that families can be reunified if they do not have the ability to stay in the United States, so they can be reunited when they are removed. HHS has a tracking system to ensure that they quickly, and as fast as possible, reunite children with families or with sponsors in the United States, which, as you know, is what TVPRA requires.</p><p>In terms of reuniting on the back end, most all of the children have been reunited with families. The ones who have not, you know, we found about 80 percent of parents have now chosen for the third time that they do not want to be reunited with their children, and so those children remain in HHS care, and so HHS is trying to find safe sponsors for them and to give them good care.</p><p>When I talk to my partners in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, and I've called a couple ministerials over the past couple months -- they just came into town for a big conference -- we've really talked about, you know, how do we look at this regionally?</p><p>The goal of all of us should be to protect vulnerable populations, should be to have a system that enables us to keep families together, and should be able to ensure a safe and orderly process so that these vulnerable populations are helped as soon as possible.</p><p>The journey, as you know, is tremendously difficult and dangerous. We have about 30 percent of women who take that journey sexually abused, 17 percent of men, 70 percent of the migrants are victims of violence. So when I meet with UNHCR -- I met with the high commissioner again yesterday -- I've asked them for -- for -- since the whole time I've been secretary, \"Let's expand the asylum capacity throughout the regions so that we can help them as soon as possible on that journey, so that they're not forced to make decisions such as using a smuggler or using a trafficker, sending kids alone to the border.\"</p><p>So it's a work in progress. I'm hopeful that the partnership will continue to grow. We've had very pointed conversations on how to address that.</p><p>But you know, our -- our laws are difficult. We do need to -- and we've asked Congress to change the law so that we can keep families who choose to come here, however they come here, whether it's illegally or legally -- that we can keep them together while we process their claim.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then we'll go back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  I'm David Grupo (ph).</p><p>And you had said in your comments that the decentralization of voting systems is actually strange (ph). And you also said that you've seen the intent of a -- foreign attackers, nation attackers, and the attempt to attack and hack the systems around the country, right? But that they haven't...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Of somebody.</p><p>QUESTION:  But that they haven't succeeded, right?</p><p>And so the question is, does that then mean that your position is that the Russian state doesn't have sufficient technical skills to hack into, say, the Louisiana voting system, or a parish of Louisiana? Is that -- is that your -- is that what you're having us believe?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No.</p><p>Actually, what I said is that nation-states have demonstrated both the will and the capability to attempt to disrupt or deny our election infrastructure. That's point number one.</p><p>So if I sit here today and I don't have any intel or any information from the state and locals that they are under some sort of scanning that we can attribute to foreign countries, what I'm actually saying is, don't let that mean anything other than what that means as a moment in time. We know they have the will. We know they have the capability. We need to continue to be prepared and think about resilience and redundancy in the system.</p><p>SEIB:  Right there, and then here (ph).</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Madam Secretary, for spending time with us this morning. I'm Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.</p><p>I appreciated what you said about 70 percent of the people coming up having been victims of violence. Listening to the president's remarks last night, a reasonable person could infer that 70 percent were perpetrators of violence.</p><p>The wave of immigration coming north has been called an invasion. A logical consequence of an invasion or a violent invasion would be an armed response.</p><p>Do you agree that it's an invasion that's coming north? And when the president says we're going to treat people with rocks as though they had rifles, that caught many in the military off-guard. What do you think that does to recruiting the new generation for military service when comments like that are made?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think on the first part, you know, to put it in perspective, we are apprehending about 1,500 to 2,000 illegal entrances a day. So just to put it in perspective, that's a daily number.</p><p>The -- the challenge with the caravan is it's a very amorphous concept. You don't get a ticket to the caravan. There's not a membership program. So what we're seeing are migrants who are potentially already on the flow, choose to be in the caravan, not choose to be in the caravan. You've seen numbers reported by the press as high as 15,000. I don't think the number is that high, based on our conversations with our partners in the region.</p><p>But I think what's difficult about this flow, or different about this flow, as you've seen talked about from everyone from President Hernandez through to Secretary Navarrete in Mexico, who's my counterpart -- one of my counterparts, is that that second and third flow are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces. They are, you know, attacking the -- the federal police. They're attacking the military in Mexico. They're putting the migrants who are in the caravan who are seeking asylum at risk.</p><p>So we're trying to work with the Mexicans to protect those who are legitimately seeking asylum to make sure that they have a way to do that as soon as possible. As you know, Mexico has offered asylum to everybody traveling north right now. We all, together, are encouraging migrants to take advantage of that for their own safety.</p><p>But we've also seen criminals in this flow. We have seen gang members. When I met with my counterparts in one of the countries in the region recently, they were very concerned because they had missing children. There were kidnappings, under a false belief that if you had a child, you would be able to come into the United States and stay.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So in general, mass migrations are dangerous for the migrants themselves. It needs to be safe. It needs to be orderly. That's the best way that we can protect them.</p><p>And again, the system is broken when we're requiring somebody who's seeking asylum to travel seven weeks through very -- a very difficult process, usually at the hands of smugglers.</p><p>So, we're working with UNHCR, working with the region to try to make sure that we can help those populations much sooner.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good morning. Thanks for being here. I'm Nili Gilbert from Matarin Capital.</p><p>I wonder how do you see the U.S. electorate and the major pressures on our country 30 or 40 years from now? And if you had to build a long-term strategic plan for the Republican Party, how would it respond to those pressures? And how is the party moving towards that today?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the one good news is that, despite the myriad of missions that we have at DHS, I do not have to do that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So I would respectfully just refer you to the RNC. We don't -- we -- national security is bipartisan. Homeland Security is bipartisan. I don't get into the politics of it. We're just trying to secure the homeland. So respectfully I wouldn't have any comment on that.</p><p>What I can tell you is, from a Homeland Security perspective, what I really worry about is how quickly the threats are morphing and that perhaps our defenses are lagging behind. So part of what I feel very strongly is my responsibility is to make sure that DHS is resourced, that they have the tools they need and they have the authorities they need to combat these new threats.</p><p>So, for example, I'll give you a quick one, as you know, we just received authority to address the risk of nefarious unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States. We see them real-time dropping drugs and other illicit materials across the border. We see them surveilling sensitive locations. We have seen them weaponized throughout theaters -- theaters of war as close as Mexico. We've seen them armed with grenades. But we did not have the authority until about two weeks ago to either monitor or identify or interdict a drone that had a nefarious purpose in the United States.</p><p>So I think we have to have a system that's much more flexible. I encourage everyone at DHS to get on their toes, be really forward-thinking, double-down on the threats we know today, but really do that horizon-scanning and think about what is emerging so that we can make sure that we're prepared for it.</p><p>So that's my strategy in that sense. We call it relentless resilience, mixed with partnership, to make sure that we can cover down on all the threats we have in the homeland.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then over here next.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Paula DiPerna, NTR Foundation. Thank you for being here.</p><p>Back to issue of the military, regardless of the capacity issue and all the threats you've just described, it does feel like militarization of the Homeland Security -- militarization of our borders. And so, at what point would the military, say, be authorized to shoot to kill on the border? And who would authorize that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the military -- of course, I would defer you to DOD for their rules of engagement.</p><p>But the military, of course, has always been allowed -- provided the opportunity to defend themselves, just as my Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers.</p><p>Our rules of engagement are published online. We're very transparent about what we do at the border and how we engage. I can't really speak more to DOD, but -- but our agents and officers are very clear.</p><p>I would say that assaults on our officers have gone -- continue to go up in some sectors. We had over 800 instances last year where they were attacked by those coming across the border. I do take their safety very seriously. </p><p>But again our rules of engagement are transparent and clear and are posted online.</p><p>SEIB:  I think we're going there next, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, I thank you for being here. I'm Neil Christian (ph) from Veritas Capital.</p><p>When the president started talking initially about a wall, I always thought it was a metaphor for increased border security. And as time is going on, he actually seems to be talking about a real, concrete border wall on the southern border.</p><p>And I really appreciate all your eloquent responses today. I'd really love to hear whether you believe that would -- if he's actually talking about a physical wall that will go up, and whether that's an effective way to protect the southern border.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think what we need is a wall system. So, we need some sort of infrastructure. We need personnel and we need technology. And we continue to look a whole variety of technological uses, including drones in a positive way, to make sure that we have situational awareness of that border.</p><p>What I would tell you is in some of the areas at our border -- and all the border areas are quite different, first of all -- I mean, some is in the middle of the desert, some near natural barriers such as rivers, but some abut directly onto cities on both sides.</p><p>There's a term we use for that which is called vanishing time. The difficulty there is somebody can cross the border and disappear, either side, into an urban environment in a matter of minutes.</p><p>So the concept of impedance and denial becomes very important. And the first and foremost way to do that is to have an infrastructure of some sort that slows them down, that gives us the opportunity to detect an illegal entry, but also hopefully it deters them from attempting it to begin with. If they have a legitimate need to come, go to a port of entry. And if they don't have a legitimate need to come -- this particularly we see a lot of unfortunate traffic that way of the smugglers, the traffickers and the transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>So, I think that there's a combination. The president has been clear we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea, but there are some areas where that impedance and denial is the difference between being able to secure the border and not being able to secure the border. But its only one part, and that's why I say we also need the personnel and technology, the sensors, the lights, the roads, the ability to apprehend, and the ability to have that situational awareness all across the border.</p><p>SEIB:  There, and then back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Patricia Rosenfield, Rosenfield Fund.</p><p>I also want to thank you very much for this very clear and eloquent meeting. But I wanted to ask about a more perhaps conceptual concern I have, and that is the pervasiveness of fear and lack of confidence in the democratic system that we know. It certainly (ph) seems to be such an issue that might prevent voting as we've talked about. But also fear (inaudible) the caravan, other issues that might require a stronger partnership with local community organizations and nonprofits, foundations, you seem to have a very effective system for intergovernmental coordination, even with local level actors internationally.</p><p>Just wondering how are you in department reaching out to the local -- to citizens?</p><p>You said that Homeland Security is not that well understood. So I'm just wondering how are you doing that? How are you working that? How are you reaching out to the -- not the corporate but the nongovernmental nonprofit sector? And how is that working? And what could be done to make it stronger?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, so that is a great question.</p><p>You know, as I mentioned, everything we do at DHS we have to do in partnership because no one entity can address all these threats.</p><p>I'll give you an example on immigration.</p><p>So I have personally, as have my component heads, been in very close contact with many NGOs, with foundations. We've asked them to be part of the conversation. We've brought them into various conferences we've had within the Northern Triangle. They play an extraordinarily important role, not just for taking care of the vulnerable populations as they travel, but also working with us in communities, both for receiving those who are coming here to claim asylum, as well as for those who are being repatriated back to the countries.</p><p>So the first ladies, particular of Guatemala, but Honduras as well, are very active. I, with them, also have conversations with the NGO community. We've asked the foundations to -- to step up. We've asked them, you know, \"What -- what additional role are you willing to play? How can you help us get additional resources to these populations? How can you help us message to them about the right way to do things?\" For example, in this particular instance, to help them understand what Mexico is offering, in terms of jobs and asylum, so that we can limit the violence on those populations.</p><p>So it's a very important role, and then I could, kind of, go through each mission set at DHS and the role they play. But I think more and more, the communities -- you know, we say \"hometown security.\" If we don't have hometown security, we don't have homeland security.</p><p>So again, immigration is an example. I meet with the ranchers, I meet with the sheriffs, I meet with the landowners to try to understand what they're seeing. What are their environments like? What are they concerned about? What can we do better, in partnership with them, to protect their constituents, as they do that every day as part of their main mission.</p><p>So I think that's crucial. I don't know that we necessarily had leveraged that community as well as we needed to in the past. So it's a very clear focus right now, particularly with respect to the human rights situation, and how we can really work with them and -- and learn from their expertise.</p><p>SEIB:  Can I just ask one quick follow-up?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah.</p><p>SEIB:  You -- you've mentioned a couple of times your conversations with your Central American colleagues. Are they doing enough, in your estimation, to actually reduce the flow -- the outflow of -- of migrants?</p><p>NIELSEN:  They are -- it's a capacity issue. Nobody is really generally -- has the capacity for these numbers that we're talking about. But they're working very hard.</p><p>We have -- we're in daily contact with all of the countries. We roll up what they're doing. They're trying a variety of different tactics and techniques in their communities to provide for those who would otherwise choose to leave.</p><p>We have been very interested in some of the U.N. data that has come out, for example, that says that many of the migrants that make their way into the United States do so because of lack of food. And so we work with the countries to find out, \"Well, how can we address that more systemically?\"</p><p>And at the end of the day, it's about building prosperity and stability in the region. So we've brought the private sector in. I've spent a lot of time talking to American companies about how, and would they consider investing further in the area. We've been working very closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to the same end.</p><p>But we -- we have to make it so that migration is -- is a choice; it's not believed by anyone to be a need. So that's, you know, ensuring that they have opportunity and -- and what they need in the region.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then probably this will be our last question there.</p><p>QUESTION:  My name's Phyllis Costanza, and I'm with UBS Optimus Foundation.</p><p>And I think a lot of resources for foundations, coming back to your point, are being spent on rehabilitation of children who are traumatized. And what's important is this issue of prevention; not having to put resources into rehabilitating children.</p><p>So how are you working, specifically with organizations like USAID and other government entities, to prevent, in the first place, children from being traumatized?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah, I mean, I think a -- a couple different ways.</p><p>The goal is -- as you know, with aid, is to do it in a targeted way with metrics so that we can then scale it and expand it if something works, or we can revise it and retarget it if it didn't produce the results that we wanted.</p><p>So the conversation to be had with USAID and the Alliance for Prosperity in general are very much about what's working, what's working from the local perspective, and how can we expand that.</p><p>We've seen some very interesting programs out of the Northern Triangle using USAID funding, for example, to have micro-competitions -- business competitions. And if you win the competition, you will receive $12,000, which is the -- which is tied to and is that same amount in that area that you would pay a smuggler to come to the United States.</p><p>So we're trying to provide additional opportunity there as an alternative and to help them understand that they have another alternative.</p><p>But the -- the conversation needs to continue to evolve. You know, what is the best way, what are the actual push factors in the region, and how can we -- again, it's stabilization, it's building prosperity, economic opportunity, continuing to help them reduce violence.</p><p>We've seen some very good news statistics on decreases in murder rates in particular parts of the Northern Triangle. Everybody needs to do more to get those numbers down even lower. So what can we do there to help build capacity, for example, for law enforcement to help ensure that there's a safe environment?</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation, but I think what we're doing is learning from the foundations who are also there on the ground what is it that you're seeing and what works and what can we be doing to help the region?</p><p>SEIB:  So final question right there. Wait a second. There you go.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Daniel Holtzman, Bank of America.</p><p>In the 2019 budget, you asked for almost a billion dollars, or a 10 percent increase, 3,300 people, 52,000 beds. Is -- what -- is -- what -- why do we still need the Army with increases like that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, as you might know, there's a difference between a request -- requesting an appropriation and having an appropriation. We don't have an appropriation at DHS yet. We're still in a continued resolution. So we are hopeful that Congress will pass an appropriation in December.</p><p>The key to this issue at the end of the day is to be able to apprehend those who do not have a legal right, to detain them and then to very quickly process them.</p><p>And expeditious processing is important, because the system is so backlogged that when you have somebody who is within our country for many, many years, it complicates the ability for us to remove them. They've likely now have roots in the community. We don't always have the ability to know where they are if they fail to appear for a variety of engagements that are preplanned, predesignated notices to appear to courts, et cetera.</p><p>So the key is to apprehend those who do not have a legal right to stay, be able to detain them, to keep them in a process with the courts that is very expedited.</p><p>And again, I don't mean to get into too much detail. This is extraordinarily complicated. But the detained docket goes much more quickly than the non-detained docket.</p><p>So the fastest way to process through our system is to be detained, so the courts will very quickly hear your case adjudicated. And then the court, of course, makes the decision to deport, not DHS. The court will give us a final order of removal for a particular person and then we seek to remove them.</p><p>So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. One is trying to address a potential massive flow that could be here in a number of days, and the other is a more systemic issue that we need to work with Congress on to address those pull factors.</p><p>Again, as I mentioned, we want to be able to keep families together. We want to be able to treat non-Mexicans the same as we treat Mexicans. There's different legal procedures for different nationalities right now that adds a lot of complexity to the system. Many who arrive at our border don't have paperwork, so we want to make sure we do that.</p><p>And then with UACs, we want to -- sorry, unaccompanied children -- we want to make sure that we can take care of them as quickly as possible in the best way possible. And there's some limits on how we can do that with that 13,000 that we have now.</p><p>So we've asked for some very specific fixes of Congress. That's the legislative side. We have the appropriations side. Then we have the immediate potential surge right now that we're trying to make sure we're prepared for.</p><p>SEIB:  So, we've reached the 9 o'clock hour. I will say you live in interesting times.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Thank you for coming in, sharing with us today.</p><p>NIELSEN:  My pleasure.

Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      Thank you for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p>      SEIB:  I'm Jerry Seib, Washington -- executive Washington editor of the Wall Street Journal. I'm the moderator today, and I'll be presiding.</p><p>      You know, the topic of today's conversation, as we agreed initially, is cyber-security and safeguarding U.S. elections, which we'll talk about because it's very timely, and -- and as we were just discussing, of broad significance around the country. There are some other issues. Border issues probably will come up. But we'll have plenty of time in the audience Q&amp;A to deal with issues beyond -- beyond cyber-security and elections.</p><p>      But again, thank you for being here.</p><p>      Let's talk about elections, because we are, as we speak, four days from what I think is a very charged and high-stakes election. Can Americans be confident their votes will count, that the system will hold, that there won't be interference, and that there won't be problems on Election Day?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Well, first of all, I just say we actually have an even higher bar.</p><p>      SEIB:  OK.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So we want to make sure that everyone's vote is counted, but is also counted correctly.</p><p>      So as many of you know, there were concerns that proved unfounded, but as we see throughout the rest of the world with some of the attempts to hack the election infrastructure, there's also concern about the integrity. So we want to vote to count, we want it counted correctly.</p><p>      What (inaudible), this is going to be the most secure election we've ever had. But as we all know, with this dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.</p><p>      So as of today, we don't have any -- any indication that a foreign government has a sustained effort or a sustained plan to hack our election infrastructure. But having said that, the moment it changes, we, of course, will let our state and local partners know.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, you know, you have said that the Russians probably attempted in 2016 to gain access to voting systems in all 50 states.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.</p><p>      SEIB:  And they were, in fact, successful in a couple of cases. What are they doing now? And what did you learn from that 2016 experience?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yeah, so I think there's -- if I could, let me just back up and divide it into a couple different threats.</p><p>      So the threat that DHS focuses on is any interference into the election infrastructure. So we work with our state and local partners, election officials, the Election Assistance Commission; I can go into a variety of other groups that we work with. But what we're trying to make sure is that that infrastructure, the voting -- the voter databases, the polling infrastructure, the voting machines are all secure.</p><p>      The other threat, though, that we're facing, which is much more difficult to get our hands around, is the very pernicious attempts at influence by foreign governments. And this takes a variety of means. FBI has lead on that.</p><p>      That's much more difficult. A lot of that, at the end of the day, is about educating the American public to think -- to think about what you're reading, think about the source, think about where it's coming from.</p><p>      R.T., as you know, which is a self-proclaimed state agent of Russia, if you can believe it, in 2017 had more views on YouTube than CNN -- double the -- double amount of views. But that is a directly state-sponsored news agency.</p><p>      So the -- that is much more difficult to combat. And that's China, that's Russia. We see that with Iran. We see the recent tape -- takedowns from Facebook.</p><p>      So that's the FBI lead we support. I think we need to continue, as a country, to figure out how to combat that part.</p><p>      But the election infrastructure, we've done a tremendous amount at the front end of training, and then all the way through to Election Day, where we'll have a war room set up.</p><p>      SEIB:  So I want to talk about Election Day and election night in a bit. </p><p>      But, you know, the -- the -- there was a -- a -- an indictment this summer of a couple of Russian cyber -- cyber activists who were affiliated with the Russian military, and that indictment said there was personal data from half a million voters hacked in 2016, probably -- I'm assuming it's Illinois. Illinois thinks that's the state that was referred to. So that was an illustration:  You've got a voter data, and you've got actual voting systems, and they're not the same thing, which is probably not well understood. Which is more vulnerable, and can you protect both at the same time?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So many of the vulnerabilities or the ways in which you might attack the systems are very similar, and we see that across infrastructure. So, as many of you know, DHS has lead for security and resilience for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, and many of these tactics and techniques are the same.</p><p>      What I would say about the voter databases is is that there's a lot of redundancy built in there.</p><p>      Every state gives you the right to vote on a provisional ballot, those that don't allow you to do same-day registration to vote. So if there's any reason why an American should show up to voting place and be told they're not on the rolls, they can still vote. And then we'll determine if there was an issue, and sometimes those issues are operability issues. We've seen some data glitches in some of the states. It had nothing to do with security, per se, but that's why we have provisional ballots. So there's some redundancy built in there.</p><p>      On the election systems themselves, what I would say is they're still very decentralized, right? So the good news is that this is not a situation where we have any indication a capability exists to, at one time, if you will, take down the voting infrastructure throughout the nation. The systems just aren't connected in that way. It would have to be a -- a very different level of attack and capability that we've seen.</p><p>      But we have seen will. We have seen the capability to disrupt. And so that's what we continue to work on.</p><p>      SEIB:  So -- so let me try to be a little more clear here.</p><p>      As we speak today, have you seen attempts to hack into either voter databases in any of the 50 states or into the actual apparatus of casting and counting votes in any of the 50 states?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, what we've seen is continued attempts to scan, you know, to access the systems. You know, that's kind of like a burglar, you know, walking around your house and trying your windows.</p><p>      In some very limited cases, we have seen access, but they have been quickly prevented or mitigated.</p><p>      SEIB:  You have seen access, so people have gotten...</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Not -- but not that we can attribute to a foreign country.</p><p>      So this is the general -- you know, if you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure, we're under constant attack and I can't stress that enough. So what would be strange is if we didn't see any attempts.</p><p>      And again, remember how the systems work. If you have an election site on your government -- e-government site, there could be lots of reasons why people are trying to access that. They could just be trying to steal, for example, people's utility information or Social Security numbers, which we also work on but might not be related to elections.</p><p>      As of today, we do not have any activity that we're attributing in the election infrastructure to a foreign entity. But again that could change in an hour, so we're -- it's very dynamic and we're continuing to watch.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, the president made some waves here in New York a few weeks ago when he said he's worried about Chinese interference in the 2018 midterm elections. What was he referring to?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  The same thing.</p><p>      So, the Chinese have a very sustained, persistent campaign through foreign influence techniques to change the way in which Americans think about China and particularly to change our policies with respect to China.</p><p>      We see that in a lot of ways. We see that through news, but we also see that through the purchase of businesses. We see that through the co-opting of officials throughout the world. We've seen them very active in investment schemes -- that's what it is -- in different parts of the world where then that country's beholden for decades of debt.</p><p>      So there's a very prolonged attempt.</p><p>      What I would say the difference between the Chinese and the Russians, the Russians are much more brazen. They're much noisier about this. And they want to affect something here and now to disrupt American democracy and to give them and edge. The Chinese are playing a long game. They're in this for the long haul.</p><p>      SEIB:  Well -- well, what you're describing is really a classic propaganda campaign, as opposed to attempts to break into and influence or gain intelligence from the voting system of the United States. Is that what really we're talking about here?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  We -- again, we haven't seen any foreign influence attributed -- I just want to keep making that clear -- at the moment, but I also hesitate to give you an equivocal answer on that.</p><p>      We just met with our Five Eyes partners in Australia a couple months ago. The conversation we have here about Russia, they have about China. They're very concerned about China doing what Russia did in our 2016 election in their election.</p><p>      So again, China has the will. They have the capability. We haven't seen it on election infrastructure, but we have seen a very wide-ranging campaign very much targeted at the United States.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, John Bolton, the national security adviser, has also talked about attempts -- or at least concerns about attempts by Iran and North Korea to also interfere in the elections. Again, what's that a reference to exactly?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Well, you saw -- you know, you saw Facebook take down over 80 Iranian-facing accounts over that last -- like last Friday, very recently. They were not complying with the rules of Facebook. It was \"inauthentic content\" is the phrase that Facebook used.</p><p>      So again, there are a lot of countries that are trying to influence how we vote, what we think, what we think about each other, how we carry on discourse. And unfortunately now we're seeing that from Iran as well.</p><p>      SEIB:  So you're really talking, again, about foreign attempts to kind of affect the atmosphere of the political conversation in this country?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yes. But the issues, of course, are tied to, in some cases, parts of the -- parts of various campaigns. If you are campaigning on a particular issue and one of these countries attempts to affect the discourse on that particular issue, it is, in some cases, a clear attempt to try to manipulate the way in which voters think.</p><p>      So that's the tie to the election. We're seeing it much more aggressive leading up to the election.</p><p>      SEIB:  But in the cases of Iran and North Korea, you're seeing it mostly in, sort of, this dark space online in the social media spheres and darker corners of the online conversation. Is it in...</p><p>      NIELSEN:  I wouldn't say -- yes...</p><p>      SEIB:  ... fake personas, fake accounts, that sort of thing?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Fake personas, fake accounts. But what they have, I think they've caught onto some of our techniques. As you know, when we find a fake persona -- we the U.S. government -- share it with the platforms. We have conversations with them. If it violates their user rules, they'll pull it down.</p><p>      I think the nation-states have become aware of that. So what they are doing now is they will take otherwise legitimate content by a non-nation-state actor and then they'll amplify it in a way to continue that conversation.</p><p>      So it's very difficult because some of this, as you know, is protected by free speech, right? This is not terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>      SEIB:  Right.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  But there's a question here as to whether Americans should have the right to know who is saying what and to be able to understand the context in which a news or just commentary's provided.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, in your -- in your own conversations with the big tech players in this space -- the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters -- how responsive have they been to this concern? And are you looking for more than you've gotten from them?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, there -- it could always be more. But they have been tremendous partners, and we do partner with them on a variety of areas:  everything from child exploitation to terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>      We also have started to work with them on a variety of capabilities they have, through A.I. and analytics, to actually spot fake personas before we become aware of them, so it's a much more proactive. I think you've heard some of the companies say they can now pull down content -- right? -- within minutes, before anyone even sees it.</p><p>      So it's an ongoing conversation. We have a variety of ways in which we work with them. But they've taken a lot of leadership in this area to really not only use incoming technologies to address it, but to be very aware that this is a problem and they have no interest in having fake, disinformation campaigns posted on their platform.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, let's -- let's talk a little bit about next Tuesday, Election Day itself. So...</p><p>      NIELSEN:  First of all, I hope everyone is voting...</p><p>      SEIB:  Very good.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  ... because the very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don't vote, right? So everyone should vote. Everyone should feel confident that state and locals are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure.</p><p>      There's a variety of ways in which we will then assess that after the fact, per the president's direction, with the intel community, with FBI. But I -- you know, in terms of what -- and I didn't mean to cut you off, but point number one in vote.</p><p>      Point number two, you know, FBI through their ops center has set up a way in which they're connected to all of their field offices. They're poised to be ready.</p><p>      We've set up a virtual war room in our National Cyber Security and Communications Integration Center. And I'll forget everybody's that's in it, because everybody's in it. We have the FBI. We have all our federal partners. We have state and local election officials. We have the Election Assistance Commission. We have the DNC. We have the RNC. We have everybody together, so that as it evolves on Election Day, we can all very quickly respond if instant response is required or if we need to communicate in a way to make sure that folks do understand what's really happening.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, you mentioned earlier the bizarre characteristic about the American election system is that there isn't an American election system. There are 50, or if you count my town, the District of Columbia, 51, election systems.</p><p>      That's a good thing, in the sense that you can't break into one -- you can't walk through one door and be in the whole house if you want to break into the system.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>      SEIB:  On the other hand, it makes it very hard to figure out if something small has happened over here that it might be happening over there, but the person over here and the person over there don't necessarily have a way to communicate.</p><p>      What have you done to fix that problem, to bring all the information together into one place? Which was a concern of a lot of state officials we talked to in 2016.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>      So, bear with me for a second, because part of your answer is bureaucratic. </p><p>      But we have set up all the government structures which we find is very, very important when it comes to critical infrastructure. Most of the critical infrastructure's owned by the private sector. The vendors are private. Each state does elections differently. Who's in charge of the elections can be different based county to county.</p><p>      So we've set up a Government Coordinating Council, which brings the government side together; and then a Sector Coordinating Council, which brings the private sector together. That enables them to have rule-based (ph) conversations. Roles and responsibilities are clear.</p><p>      And then we have worked with them to set up an Information-Sharing and Analysis Center. For those of you in the room who might be in the financial sector, you're very familiar with FS-ISAC. This is another way to do this.</p><p>      But through this we can share real-time machine-to-machine threat indicators. So as something happens in one area, we can quickly share that profile of threat with all of our other partners.</p><p>      It's the fastest-growing ISAC. We have all 50 states, we have over 1,300 counties working with us. It's a good news story.</p><p>      But that allows that immediate sharing, that you see something, then everybody else has that essentially in their queue, in their sensors, in their network defense to look for as well.</p><p>      SEIB:  And just to be clear, that didn't exist in 2016?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  It did -- none of this existed in 2016 that I'm describing.</p><p>      SEIB:  And so, on Election Day, let's assume that somebody in Connecticut thinks -- sees what they think was an attempt to break into the system by which people are casting and counting votes. That information goes where on Election Day? And who finds out in real time that something is happening that they ought to be on the lookout for?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So it is -- it is a voluntary partnership. And that's some thing I think -- I think is well understood at this point; that there was some confusion in 2016, there was concerns by state and locals that the federal government would somehow take over the constitutional role of state and locals to conduct elections. That's not what we're doing. It is a voluntary partnership.</p><p>      But they know exactly who to call and how to send the information in a protected manner. We receive that immediately, we assess it, and then we push it back out to all the other states to protect them.</p><p>      The other benefit we have now that we didn't have in 2016:  our pulling all of the information from the intel community. So, we have very advanced -- not only signatures and threat indicators from the intel community, but we also have access to their analysis and understanding in a somewhat predictive way, based on tactics of how some adversary might try to attack us in critical infrastructure. And that's at large.</p><p>      But we pull all that together. They sit with us. We have many, many folks now that have clearances within the community. And those who don't, we have assured them that if we have credible actual information, we will immediately share. I'm not going to let a clearance, in that case, stand in the way. We have that information, many cases they're elected.</p><p>      But we will push out that information. We did not have the mechanisms to that either in 2016.</p><p>      SEIB:  Well, there's also been some question -- and again this is a bit of a bureaucratic question. But in -- in Washington there's been some question about whether funding is adequate to allow this system to really develop; will the states have the funding they need to secure their own systems, and whether there's been an adequately funded national effort to wire everything together.</p><p>      Is there enough money in the system to do the kind of protective work you're talking about?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So we're -- you know, we're working with the -- states need to tell us that. They know that. Their working through that problem set.</p><p>      We have an entire catalog -- that's literally -- literally what it is -- of services that we're offering that are completely free. They can take us up on that. We'll tailor them. We'll work with them. But it's everything from hygiene scanning, phishing training, through to very in-depth vulnerability assessments and everything in between -- exercises, awareness.</p><p>      But they also have in-house, in some cases, professionals who work with them. In some cases they've hired firms from the network defender community, from cyber-security. So they have to look at all of that, look at what they have, and then we ask them to tell us to communicate with us, \"What is it that you need?\"</p><p>      So, we've seen some great examples where Rhode Island, for example, has been able to budget to upgrade their systems. We've seen other states that have taken (inaudible) where the state budget has provided a tremendous amount of information -- resources, but then asked the counties to match that, so it's both levels of government in on this.</p><p>      But we've also seen states like Georgia throw a flag and say, \"Gosh, we really need to update all of our aging infrastructure.\" $60 million or $80 million that they came up with, and they're not able to budget for that. </p><p>      So what we've said to states is, \"Please come up with the amounts that you need, what is it that you need, and we will help you work with Congress to make sure.\"</p><p>      For 2020 what I've asked is that all states have auditable systems, because at the end of the day -- and I want to be clear...</p><p>      SEIB:  Which means what? What's an auditable system?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  An auditable system means that when you vote, we have a way to go back after the -- after the fact to ensure that all votes were counted and were counted correctly.</p><p>      There's a variety of different ways to do that. One is just paper ballots. So some states have gone back to paper ballots. It's, you know, old school, but you can count them. It's a piece of paper with your vote on it, and we can double-check that the count is correct.</p><p>      Others are technology. So there are some machines where, as you vote, you can choose to essentially -- it's almost like lever that you pull, and it spits out a paper copy of your vote. You can then have access to that, and you can also give that to your polling place. Also it enables all of us to then verify that.</p><p>      Many, many states have moved towards some sense of an auditable system, but there are still some counties and some states that don't have that.</p><p>      SEIB:  Should there be a national standard, a national system?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, the national system part is difficult, because each community votes differently.</p><p>      And so, what we have done is given them best practices:  \"You need to meet these types of level of security; how you then do that, we'll work with you to make sure that it meets that.\"</p><p>      So it's a softer version of a hard-line regulatory standard. But nonetheless, it's:  \"These are the 10 things you have to do at minimum to make sure that (inaudible).\"</p><p>      SEIB:  And are states receptive to that?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yeah. So, we -- and actually they've been very helpful.</p><p>      We also have a last-mile initiative. We've worked with the states to get to that part you had mentioned earlier, which is some of the much smaller counties are very unlikely to be resourced. So we've worked with states to go county by county and help them with an assessment on what additional activities or resources they could provide to get everybody up to speed.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, I want to turn to the members for questions, but let me ask one last broader question.</p><p>      And when you step back from all of this and you think about in particular the foreign actors we've been talking about, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, there are a lot of pernicious aspects to their meddling. One is that people lose confidence in the system. One is that they don't trust the results. One is that they simply don't show up to vote because they fear their vote isn't going to count.</p><p>      What is your biggest concern when you think about foreign actors attempting to interfere in the election system? What's the most pernicious thing you worry about?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  You know, it -- it's two things.</p><p>      One, you know, this is basic cyber 101 what I'm going to say, but we've got to patch. We have to have systems configured correctly. We have to make sure that the access control and passwords are strong.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  We just finished National Security -- or excuse me Cyber-Security Awareness Month. I was making the joke all month, but many people didn't seem to recognize it was joke, which is don't use \"password\" as your password. If \"Password\" is a capital P, still doesn't count.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      But people were actually surprised by that. \"Well, why not? You know, I've put a capital letter...\"</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      \"... with the word, so...\"</p><p>      SEIB:  Just a 1 at the end...</p><p>      NIELSEN:  That's right.</p><p>      So there's more educating that we need to do on the importance of a strong partner -- passwords.</p><p>      My biggest concern is that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a particular area.</p><p>      And on that, we've met, we've done exercises, we've done calls with all the news agencies, anybody reporting election results. We did an exercise last Friday to help them understand these are the legitimate ways in which you can receive official results.</p><p>      If you get an e-mail from someone claiming to be an election official, understand you want to get the results out as quickly as possible, but please refrain, because we cannot verify that e-mail real-time from you that it comes from an election official.</p><p>      So use the predesignated ways in which you should receive and report, and of course they'll also be with us in (inaudible). If you have any questions real-time, we can work through that.</p><p>      But I think we have to not jump to conclusions as Americans. Again, there are operability issues. We saw one state recently with the way they -- their machines worked pre-voting, if you didn't give it enough time to load, you tried to get through your voting very quickly and click and you wanted to do an all-party option, it wasn't really allowing you to do that. That wasn't a cyber-security issue. It was just an operability issue.</p><p>      So everyone, we just need to pause, I think, election night and not jump to conclusions.</p><p>      SEIB:  And the goal here if you're a foreign actor is to sow discord in the United States or to undermine the whole idea of democracy generally speaking?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  I honestly think it's all of the above.</p><p>      We definitely see it on the discord. We have seen them, interestingly, put material online that represents both ends of any particular issue, the full scheme, the full...</p><p>      SEIB:  Yes.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  They're not necessarily focused on getting you to believe X, and should you believe X or should you believe Y, if you kind of believe X, I'm going to get this -- you get my point.</p><p>      But in terms of the democracy, I mean, 2016 showed us they absolutely were willing to attack the very essence of what makes our country a country, which is the sacredness of our elections. So I do think it's both.</p><p>      SEIB:  With that, let me open it to the floor.</p><p>      Just a couple of reminders for the members here. This is on the record. Wait for a microphone; there'll be some moving around. State your name and your affiliation. And please make it a question -- singular.</p><p>      So maybe start right there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you. Ann Cooper, Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>      You've been talking about foreign threats. The president has spoken a lot about what he considers to be a domestic threat, which is the press in this country. And I wanted to ask if you share his view that he's stated that the press is the enemy of the people.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, first let me start by saying the remark that I saw him use was \"fake news is the enemy.\" There is something to be said -- none of us want to read something that's not true.</p><p>      I think relationships with the press are very important. I tend to seek opportunities to engage with them.</p><p>      I can tell you from the DHS portfolio with 23 different agencies and over 240,000 employees, we do a lot and it's not well-understood.</p><p>      I really value the relationship with the press to help us get information out. Certainly in disaster response the press plays an extraordinarily important role for helping us to save lives. Should we ever have an attack -- but even when we saw with the bomber and the shooter, the role that the press played was extraordinarily helpful from our perspective.</p><p>      So I actually think that it's a very useful relationship from a DHS mission perspective, and one that I try to be thankful for and also find other ways to help get messages out.</p><p>      SEIB:  Why don't we go here and then here?</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you. David Shuman, Northwoods Capital.</p><p>      Could you talk a little bit about the domestic terrorism threat and how DHS is configured to attack it; how many intelligence analysts you have working on the domestic intelligence threat?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Sure.</p><p>      So one of the things that we did at DHS was we broadened our concept, first of all, of what that means. So from my perspective, hate is hate, violence is violence. It has no place in the United States.</p><p>      So we've expanded our office to focus on preventing all forms of violence in the United States that are motivated by a terrorist act.</p><p>      But it's not even just terrorists. It's -- you know, we look at white supremacists, we look at any ideology that lends itself or results in extreme violent behavior.</p><p>      We have all of DHS focused on that. So we work with the FBI. We work with our joint terrorism task forces the FBI runs, as you know. We work through the fusion centers to push that information out. And we have very close relationships with state and local law enforcement and homeland security advisers.</p><p>      The internet is -- has really made this space for us quite difficult, because in a moment like this, a terrorist or somebody who would seek to do an American harm worlds away can in a matter of seconds inspire somebody in the United States to commit an act. So we work on that.</p><p>      That's a very different type of threat than what we saw, for example, in 9/11. It's very decentralized. It's much more difficult to attack. A lot of it's on the dark web. So we have a lot of capabilities we're building within the department to address it from that perspective.</p><p>      But I think the only way that we win against those types of threats is by (inaudible), comprehensive, and recognizing that violence is violence and we can't stand for it.</p><p>      SEIB:  Here and then here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Hi. I'm Paul Steiger from ProPublica.</p><p>      The president has talked about mobilizing the Army to protect the borders. Talked about 5,000 troops, you know, maybe more. Do you need the Army? I mean, aren't you in a position to secure the border against a march by a couple thousand people?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, two things.</p><p>      One is the -- the timing of the number of people. We're all -- I think everyone in the country is watching it to one extent or another. If they get on a train or they get on buses, they'll be here in a matter of days. If they stay on foot, they'll be here, you know, in a month or so.</p><p>      So first we just have a capacity issue. When we're talking about those numbers either coming to a port of entry or trying to come between our ports of entry, no, we do not have the capacity and capability to address that type of a flow.</p><p>      So what we've asked DOD to do is support us with engineering, support us with logistics, with planning. And then as a second phase, to help make sure that we can defend our ports of entry.</p><p>      And that is because of what we've seen particularly in that second and third phase of the flows in Mexico that unfortunately did turn quite violent. By the time we're talking about Molotov cocktails and use of firearms, it's my duty to ensure that our (inaudible) agents are secure.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  I would also note that part of our mission at DHS is to facilitate legal trade and travel. We do not want that legal trade and travel to be put at risk in any way by a mass flow of people. So it's a capacity-building, capability-building to ensure that we can continue to execute our mission.</p><p>      SEIB:  Right here, and then there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Nina Gardner, professor of business and human rights at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington.</p><p>      I wanted to ask you about family separations, and what were you thinking when you announced that policy without having a tracking system. I think our luggage at airports are taken care of more -- with more respect than the children that were separated. So I was wondering, what are you doing to reunify the children with their families now? And how do you stay up (sic) at night?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Well, thank you for the...</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      ... way in which your question was asked.</p><p>      I would say that at DHS, we enforce the law, and unfortunately, some parents chose to break the law and enter the country in a way that did not go to a port of entry.</p><p>      We do have a tracking system. We take very good care of the children that come into our care.</p><p>      The part that I really worry about, is last year we had 70,000 children dropped off at the border by smugglers and traffickers whose parents decided to send them alone on an extraordinarily dangerous journey. So we have about 13,000 of those who are in HHS care right now.</p><p>      The tracking that we had, we used to ensure that families can be reunified if they do not have the ability to stay in the United States, so they can be reunited when they are removed. HHS has a tracking system to ensure that they quickly, and as fast as possible, reunite children with families or with sponsors in the United States, which, as you know, is what TVPRA requires.</p><p>      In terms of reuniting on the back end, most all of the children have been reunited with families. The ones who have not, you know, we found about 80 percent of parents have now chosen for the third time that they do not want to be reunited with their children, and so those children remain in HHS care, and so HHS is trying to find safe sponsors for them and to give them good care.</p><p>      When I talk to my partners in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, and I've called a couple ministerials over the past couple months -- they just came into town for a big conference -- we've really talked about, you know, how do we look at this regionally?</p><p>      The goal of all of us should be to protect vulnerable populations, should be to have a system that enables us to keep families together, and should be able to ensure a safe and orderly process so that these vulnerable populations are helped as soon as possible.</p><p>      The journey, as you know, is tremendously difficult and dangerous. We have about 30 percent of women who take that journey sexually abused, 17 percent of men, 70 percent of the migrants are victims of violence. So when I meet with UNHCR -- I met with the high commissioner again yesterday -- I've asked them for -- for -- since the whole time I've been secretary, \"Let's expand the asylum capacity throughout the regions so that we can help them as soon as possible on that journey, so that they're not forced to make decisions such as using a smuggler or using a trafficker, sending kids alone to the border.\"</p><p>      So it's a work in progress. I'm hopeful that the partnership will continue to grow. We've had very pointed conversations on how to address that.</p><p>      But you know, our -- our laws are difficult. We do need to -- and we've asked Congress to change the law so that we can keep families who choose to come here, however they come here, whether it's illegally or legally -- that we can keep them together while we process their claim.</p><p>      SEIB:  Here, and then we'll go back there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  I'm David Grupo (ph).</p><p>      And you had said in your comments that the decentralization of voting systems is actually strange (ph). And you also said that you've seen the intent of a -- foreign attackers, nation attackers, and the attempt to attack and hack the systems around the country, right? But that they haven't...</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Of somebody.</p><p>      QUESTION:  But that they haven't succeeded, right?</p><p>      And so the question is, does that then mean that your position is that the Russian state doesn't have sufficient technical skills to hack into, say, the Louisiana voting system, or a parish of Louisiana? Is that -- is that your -- is that what you're having us believe?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  No.</p><p>      Actually, what I said is that nation-states have demonstrated both the will and the capability to attempt to disrupt or deny our election infrastructure. That's point number one.</p><p>      So if I sit here today and I don't have any intel or any information from the state and locals that they are under some sort of scanning that we can attribute to foreign countries, what I'm actually saying is, don't let that mean anything other than what that means as a moment in time. We know they have the will. We know they have the capability. We need to continue to be prepared and think about resilience and redundancy in the system.</p><p>      SEIB:  Right there, and then here (ph).</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you, Madam Secretary, for spending time with us this morning. I'm Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.</p><p>      I appreciated what you said about 70 percent of the people coming up having been victims of violence. Listening to the president's remarks last night, a reasonable person could infer that 70 percent were perpetrators of violence.</p><p>      The wave of immigration coming north has been called an invasion. A logical consequence of an invasion or a violent invasion would be an armed response.</p><p>      Do you agree that it's an invasion that's coming north? And when the president says we're going to treat people with rocks as though they had rifles, that caught many in the military off-guard. What do you think that does to recruiting the new generation for military service when comments like that are made?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, I think on the first part, you know, to put it in perspective, we are apprehending about 1,500 to 2,000 illegal entrances a day. So just to put it in perspective, that's a daily number.</p><p>      The -- the challenge with the caravan is it's a very amorphous concept. You don't get a ticket to the caravan. There's not a membership program. So what we're seeing are migrants who are potentially already on the flow, choose to be in the caravan, not choose to be in the caravan. You've seen numbers reported by the press as high as 15,000. I don't think the number is that high, based on our conversations with our partners in the region.</p><p>      But I think what's difficult about this flow, or different about this flow, as you've seen talked about from everyone from President Hernandez through to Secretary Navarrete in Mexico, who's my counterpart -- one of my counterparts, is that that second and third flow are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces. They are, you know, attacking the -- the federal police. They're attacking the military in Mexico. They're putting the migrants who are in the caravan who are seeking asylum at risk.</p><p>      So we're trying to work with the Mexicans to protect those who are legitimately seeking asylum to make sure that they have a way to do that as soon as possible. As you know, Mexico has offered asylum to everybody traveling north right now. We all, together, are encouraging migrants to take advantage of that for their own safety.</p><p>      But we've also seen criminals in this flow. We have seen gang members. When I met with my counterparts in one of the countries in the region recently, they were very concerned because they had missing children. There were kidnappings, under a false belief that if you had a child, you would be able to come into the United States and stay.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So in general, mass migrations are dangerous for the migrants themselves. It needs to be safe. It needs to be orderly. That's the best way that we can protect them.</p><p>      And again, the system is broken when we're requiring somebody who's seeking asylum to travel seven weeks through very -- a very difficult process, usually at the hands of smugglers.</p><p>      So, we're working with UNHCR, working with the region to try to make sure that we can help those populations much sooner.</p><p>      SEIB:  Right here and then here.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Good morning. Thanks for being here. I'm Nili Gilbert from Matarin Capital.</p><p>      I wonder how do you see the U.S. electorate and the major pressures on our country 30 or 40 years from now? And if you had to build a long-term strategic plan for the Republican Party, how would it respond to those pressures? And how is the party moving towards that today?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, the one good news is that, despite the myriad of missions that we have at DHS, I do not have to do that one.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      So I would respectfully just refer you to the RNC. We don't -- we -- national security is bipartisan. Homeland Security is bipartisan. I don't get into the politics of it. We're just trying to secure the homeland. So respectfully I wouldn't have any comment on that.</p><p>      What I can tell you is, from a Homeland Security perspective, what I really worry about is how quickly the threats are morphing and that perhaps our defenses are lagging behind. So part of what I feel very strongly is my responsibility is to make sure that DHS is resourced, that they have the tools they need and they have the authorities they need to combat these new threats.</p><p>      So, for example, I'll give you a quick one, as you know, we just received authority to address the risk of nefarious unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States. We see them real-time dropping drugs and other illicit materials across the border. We see them surveilling sensitive locations. We have seen them weaponized throughout theaters -- theaters of war as close as Mexico. We've seen them armed with grenades. But we did not have the authority until about two weeks ago to either monitor or identify or interdict a drone that had a nefarious purpose in the United States.</p><p>      So I think we have to have a system that's much more flexible. I encourage everyone at DHS to get on their toes, be really forward-thinking, double-down on the threats we know today, but really do that horizon-scanning and think about what is emerging so that we can make sure that we're prepared for it.</p><p>      So that's my strategy in that sense. We call it relentless resilience, mixed with partnership, to make sure that we can cover down on all the threats we have in the homeland.</p><p>      SEIB:  Here, and then over here next.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you. Paula DiPerna, NTR Foundation. Thank you for being here.</p><p>      Back to issue of the military, regardless of the capacity issue and all the threats you've just described, it does feel like militarization of the Homeland Security -- militarization of our borders. And so, at what point would the military, say, be authorized to shoot to kill on the border? And who would authorize that?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, the military -- of course, I would defer you to DOD for their rules of engagement.</p><p>      But the military, of course, has always been allowed -- provided the opportunity to defend themselves, just as my Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers.</p><p>      Our rules of engagement are published online. We're very transparent about what we do at the border and how we engage. I can't really speak more to DOD, but -- but our agents and officers are very clear.</p><p>      I would say that assaults on our officers have gone -- continue to go up in some sectors. We had over 800 instances last year where they were attacked by those coming across the border. I do take their safety very seriously. </p><p>      But again our rules of engagement are transparent and clear and are posted online.</p><p>      SEIB:  I think we're going there next, and then there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, I thank you for being here. I'm Neil Christian (ph) from Veritas Capital.</p><p>      When the president started talking initially about a wall, I always thought it was a metaphor for increased border security. And as time is going on, he actually seems to be talking about a real, concrete border wall on the southern border.</p><p>      And I really appreciate all your eloquent responses today. I'd really love to hear whether you believe that would -- if he's actually talking about a physical wall that will go up, and whether that's an effective way to protect the southern border.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, I think what we need is a wall system. So, we need some sort of infrastructure. We need personnel and we need technology. And we continue to look a whole variety of technological uses, including drones in a positive way, to make sure that we have situational awareness of that border.</p><p>      What I would tell you is in some of the areas at our border -- and all the border areas are quite different, first of all -- I mean, some is in the middle of the desert, some near natural barriers such as rivers, but some abut directly onto cities on both sides.</p><p>      There's a term we use for that which is called vanishing time. The difficulty there is somebody can cross the border and disappear, either side, into an urban environment in a matter of minutes.</p><p>      So the concept of impedance and denial becomes very important. And the first and foremost way to do that is to have an infrastructure of some sort that slows them down, that gives us the opportunity to detect an illegal entry, but also hopefully it deters them from attempting it to begin with. If they have a legitimate need to come, go to a port of entry. And if they don't have a legitimate need to come -- this particularly we see a lot of unfortunate traffic that way of the smugglers, the traffickers and the transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>      So, I think that there's a combination. The president has been clear we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea, but there are some areas where that impedance and denial is the difference between being able to secure the border and not being able to secure the border. But its only one part, and that's why I say we also need the personnel and technology, the sensors, the lights, the roads, the ability to apprehend, and the ability to have that situational awareness all across the border.</p><p>      SEIB:  There, and then back there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you. Patricia Rosenfield, Rosenfield Fund.</p><p>      I also want to thank you very much for this very clear and eloquent meeting. But I wanted to ask about a more perhaps conceptual concern I have, and that is the pervasiveness of fear and lack of confidence in the democratic system that we know. It certainly (ph) seems to be such an issue that might prevent voting as we've talked about. But also fear (inaudible) the caravan, other issues that might require a stronger partnership with local community organizations and nonprofits, foundations, you seem to have a very effective system for intergovernmental coordination, even with local level actors internationally.</p><p>      Just wondering how are you in department reaching out to the local -- to citizens?</p><p>      You said that Homeland Security is not that well understood. So I'm just wondering how are you doing that? How are you working that? How are you reaching out to the -- not the corporate but the nongovernmental nonprofit sector? And how is that working? And what could be done to make it stronger?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yes, so that is a great question.</p><p>      You know, as I mentioned, everything we do at DHS we have to do in partnership because no one entity can address all these threats.</p><p>      I'll give you an example on immigration.</p><p>      So I have personally, as have my component heads, been in very close contact with many NGOs, with foundations. We've asked them to be part of the conversation. We've brought them into various conferences we've had within the Northern Triangle. They play an extraordinarily important role, not just for taking care of the vulnerable populations as they travel, but also working with us in communities, both for receiving those who are coming here to claim asylum, as well as for those who are being repatriated back to the countries.</p><p>      So the first ladies, particular of Guatemala, but Honduras as well, are very active. I, with them, also have conversations with the NGO community. We've asked the foundations to -- to step up. We've asked them, you know, \"What -- what additional role are you willing to play? How can you help us get additional resources to these populations? How can you help us message to them about the right way to do things?\" For example, in this particular instance, to help them understand what Mexico is offering, in terms of jobs and asylum, so that we can limit the violence on those populations.</p><p>      So it's a very important role, and then I could, kind of, go through each mission set at DHS and the role they play. But I think more and more, the communities -- you know, we say \"hometown security.\" If we don't have hometown security, we don't have homeland security.</p><p>      So again, immigration is an example. I meet with the ranchers, I meet with the sheriffs, I meet with the landowners to try to understand what they're seeing. What are their environments like? What are they concerned about? What can we do better, in partnership with them, to protect their constituents, as they do that every day as part of their main mission.</p><p>      So I think that's crucial. I don't know that we necessarily had leveraged that community as well as we needed to in the past. So it's a very clear focus right now, particularly with respect to the human rights situation, and how we can really work with them and -- and learn from their expertise.</p><p>      SEIB:  Can I just ask one quick follow-up?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yeah.</p><p>      SEIB:  You -- you've mentioned a couple of times your conversations with your Central American colleagues. Are they doing enough, in your estimation, to actually reduce the flow -- the outflow of -- of migrants?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  They are -- it's a capacity issue. Nobody is really generally -- has the capacity for these numbers that we're talking about. But they're working very hard.</p><p>      We have -- we're in daily contact with all of the countries. We roll up what they're doing. They're trying a variety of different tactics and techniques in their communities to provide for those who would otherwise choose to leave.</p><p>      We have been very interested in some of the U.N. data that has come out, for example, that says that many of the migrants that make their way into the United States do so because of lack of food. And so we work with the countries to find out, \"Well, how can we address that more systemically?\"</p><p>      And at the end of the day, it's about building prosperity and stability in the region. So we've brought the private sector in. I've spent a lot of time talking to American companies about how, and would they consider investing further in the area. We've been working very closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to the same end.</p><p>      But we -- we have to make it so that migration is -- is a choice; it's not believed by anyone to be a need. So that's, you know, ensuring that they have opportunity and -- and what they need in the region.</p><p>      SEIB:  Right here, and then probably this will be our last question there.</p><p>      QUESTION:  My name's Phyllis Costanza, and I'm with UBS Optimus Foundation.</p><p>      And I think a lot of resources for foundations, coming back to your point, are being spent on rehabilitation of children who are traumatized. And what's important is this issue of prevention; not having to put resources into rehabilitating children.</p><p>      So how are you working, specifically with organizations like USAID and other government entities, to prevent, in the first place, children from being traumatized?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  Yeah, I mean, I think a -- a couple different ways.</p><p>      The goal is -- as you know, with aid, is to do it in a targeted way with metrics so that we can then scale it and expand it if something works, or we can revise it and retarget it if it didn't produce the results that we wanted.</p><p>      So the conversation to be had with USAID and the Alliance for Prosperity in general are very much about what's working, what's working from the local perspective, and how can we expand that.</p><p>      We've seen some very interesting programs out of the Northern Triangle using USAID funding, for example, to have micro-competitions -- business competitions. And if you win the competition, you will receive $12,000, which is the -- which is tied to and is that same amount in that area that you would pay a smuggler to come to the United States.</p><p>      So we're trying to provide additional opportunity there as an alternative and to help them understand that they have another alternative.</p><p>      But the -- the conversation needs to continue to evolve. You know, what is the best way, what are the actual push factors in the region, and how can we -- again, it's stabilization, it's building prosperity, economic opportunity, continuing to help them reduce violence.</p><p>      We've seen some very good news statistics on decreases in murder rates in particular parts of the Northern Triangle. Everybody needs to do more to get those numbers down even lower. So what can we do there to help build capacity, for example, for law enforcement to help ensure that there's a safe environment?</p><p>      So it's an ongoing conversation, but I think what we're doing is learning from the foundations who are also there on the ground what is it that you're seeing and what works and what can we be doing to help the region?</p><p>      SEIB:  So final question right there. Wait a second. There you go.</p><p>      QUESTION:  Thank you. Daniel Holtzman, Bank of America.</p><p>      In the 2019 budget, you asked for almost a billion dollars, or a 10 percent increase, 3,300 people, 52,000 beds. Is -- what -- is -- what -- why do we still need the Army with increases like that?</p><p>      NIELSEN:  So, as you might know, there's a difference between a request -- requesting an appropriation and having an appropriation. We don't have an appropriation at DHS yet. We're still in a continued resolution. So we are hopeful that Congress will pass an appropriation in December.</p><p>      The key to this issue at the end of the day is to be able to apprehend those who do not have a legal right, to detain them and then to very quickly process them.</p><p>      And expeditious processing is important, because the system is so backlogged that when you have somebody who is within our country for many, many years, it complicates the ability for us to remove them. They've likely now have roots in the community. We don't always have the ability to know where they are if they fail to appear for a variety of engagements that are preplanned, predesignated notices to appear to courts, et cetera.</p><p>      So the key is to apprehend those who do not have a legal right to stay, be able to detain them, to keep them in a process with the courts that is very expedited.</p><p>      And again, I don't mean to get into too much detail. This is extraordinarily complicated. But the detained docket goes much more quickly than the non-detained docket.</p><p>      So the fastest way to process through our system is to be detained, so the courts will very quickly hear your case adjudicated. And then the court, of course, makes the decision to deport, not DHS. The court will give us a final order of removal for a particular person and then we seek to remove them.</p><p>      So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. One is trying to address a potential massive flow that could be here in a number of days, and the other is a more systemic issue that we need to work with Congress on to address those pull factors.</p><p>      Again, as I mentioned, we want to be able to keep families together. We want to be able to treat non-Mexicans the same as we treat Mexicans. There's different legal procedures for different nationalities right now that adds a lot of complexity to the system. Many who arrive at our border don't have paperwork, so we want to make sure we do that.</p><p>      And then with UACs, we want to -- sorry, unaccompanied children -- we want to make sure that we can take care of them as quickly as possible in the best way possible. And there's some limits on how we can do that with that 13,000 that we have now.</p><p>      So we've asked for some very specific fixes of Congress. That's the legislative side. We have the appropriations side. Then we have the immediate potential surge right now that we're trying to make sure we're prepared for.</p><p>      SEIB:  So, we've reached the 9 o'clock hour. I will say you live in interesting times.</p><p>      (LAUGHTER)</p><p>      Thank you for coming in, sharing with us today.</p><p>      NIELSEN:  My pleasure. My pleasure.</p><p>      (APPLAUSE)</p><p>      END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2128026608</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMW-04G1-JBHT-D2X4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9582\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Bloomberg Government</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 2, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Bureau of Investigation--FBI</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Russia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Illinois</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>International relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Infrastructure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Councils</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>National security</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 922120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security <person><nameText>Kirstjen Nielsen.  </nameText></person></p><p>      Thank you for joining us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  My pleasure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  I'm Jerry Seib, Washington -- executive Washington editor of the Wall Street Journal. I'm the moderator today, and I'll be presiding.  </p><p>      You know, the topic of today's conversation, as we agreed initially, is cyber-security and safeguarding U.S. elections, which we'll talk about because it's very timely, and -- and as we were just discussing, of broad significance around the country. There are some other issues. Border issues probably will come up. But we'll have plenty of time in the audience Q&amp;A to deal with issues beyond -- beyond cyber-security and elections.  </p><p>      But again, thank you for being here.  </p><p>      Let's talk about elections, because we are, as we speak, four days from what I think is a very charged and high-stakes election. Can Americans be confident their votes will count, that the system will hold, that there won't be interference, and that there won't be problems on Election Day?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I just say we actually have an even higher bar.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So we want to make sure that everyone's vote is counted, but is also counted correctly.  </p><p>      So as many of you know, there were concerns that proved unfounded, but as we see throughout the rest of the world with some of the attempts to hack the election infrastructure, there's also concern about the integrity. So we want to vote to count, we want it counted correctly.  </p><p>      What (inaudible), this is going to be the most secure election we've ever had. But as we all know, with this dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.  </p><p>      So as of today, we don't have any -- any indication that a foreign government has a sustained effort or a sustained plan to hack our election infrastructure. But having said that, the moment it changes, we, of course, will let our state and local partners know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, you know, you have said that the Russians probably attempted in 2016 to gain access to voting systems in all 50 states.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  And they were, in fact, successful in a couple of cases. What are they doing now? And what did you learn from that 2016 experience?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yeah, so I think there's -- if I could, let me just back up and divide it into a couple different threats.  </p><p>      So the threat that DHS focuses on is any interference into the election infrastructure. So we work with our state and local partners, election officials, the Election Assistance Commission; I can go into a variety of other groups that we work with. But what we're trying to make sure is that that infrastructure, the voting -- the voter databases, the polling infrastructure, the voting machines are all secure.  </p><p>      The other threat, though, that we're facing, which is much more difficult to get our hands around, is the very pernicious attempts at influence by foreign governments. And this takes a variety of means. FBI has lead on that.  </p><p>      That's much more difficult. A lot of that, at the end of the day, is about educating the American public to think -- to think about what you're reading, think about the source, think about where it's coming from.  </p><p>      R.T., as you know, which is a self-proclaimed state agent of Russia, if you can believe it, in 2017 had more views on YouTube than CNN -- double the -- double amount of views. But that is a directly state-sponsored news agency.  </p><p>      So the -- that is much more difficult to combat. And that's China, that's Russia. We see that with Iran. We see the recent tape -- takedowns from Facebook.  </p><p>      So that's the FBI lead we support. I think we need to continue, as a country, to figure out how to combat that part.  </p><p>      But the election infrastructure, we've done a tremendous amount at the front end of training, and then all the way through to Election Day, where we'll have a war room set up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So I want to talk about Election Day and election night in a bit.   </p><p>      But, you know, the -- the -- there was a -- a -- an indictment this summer of a couple of Russian cyber -- cyber activists who were affiliated with the Russian military, and that indictment said there was personal data from half a million voters hacked in 2016, probably -- I'm assuming it's Illinois. Illinois thinks that's the state that was referred to. So that was an illustration:  You've got a voter data, and you've got actual voting systems, and they're not the same thing, which is probably not well understood. Which is more vulnerable, and can you protect both at the same time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So many of the vulnerabilities or the ways in which you might attack the systems are very similar, and we see that across infrastructure. So, as many of you know, DHS has lead for security and resilience for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, and many of these tactics and techniques are the same.  </p><p>      What I would say about the voter databases is is that there's a lot of redundancy built in there.  </p><p>      Every state gives you the right to vote on a provisional ballot, those that don't allow you to do same-day registration to vote. So if there's any reason why an American should show up to voting place and be told they're not on the rolls, they can still vote. And then we'll determine if there was an issue, and sometimes those issues are operability issues. We've seen some data glitches in some of the states. It had nothing to do with security, per se, but that's why we have provisional ballots. So there's some redundancy built in there.  </p><p>      On the election systems themselves, what I would say is they're still very decentralized, right? So the good news is that this is not a situation where we have any indication a capability exists to, at one time, if you will, take down the voting infrastructure throughout the nation. The systems just aren't connected in that way. It would have to be a -- a very different level of attack and capability that we've seen.  </p><p>      But we have seen will. We have seen the capability to disrupt. And so that's what we continue to work on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So -- so let me try to be a little more clear here.  </p><p>      As we speak today, have you seen attempts to hack into either voter databases in any of the 50 states or into the actual apparatus of casting and counting votes in any of the 50 states?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, what we've seen is continued attempts to scan, you know, to access the systems. You know, that's kind of like a burglar, you know, walking around your house and trying your windows.  </p><p>      In some very limited cases, we have seen access, but they have been quickly prevented or mitigated.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  You have seen access, so people have gotten...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Not -- but not that we can attribute to a foreign country.  </p><p>      So this is the general -- you know, if you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure, we're under constant attack and I can't stress that enough. So what would be strange is if we didn't see any attempts.  </p><p>      And again, remember how the systems work. If you have an election site on your government -- e-government site, there could be lots of reasons why people are trying to access that. They could just be trying to steal, for example, people's utility information or Social Security numbers, which we also work on but might not be related to elections.  </p><p>      As of today, we do not have any activity that we're attributing in the election infrastructure to a foreign entity. But again that could change in an hour, so we're -- it's very dynamic and we're continuing to watch.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, the president made some waves here in New York a few weeks ago when he said he's worried about Chinese interference in the 2018 midterm elections. What was he referring to?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  The same thing.  </p><p>      So, the Chinese have a very sustained, persistent campaign through foreign influence techniques to change the way in which Americans think about China and particularly to change our policies with respect to China.  </p><p>      We see that in a lot of ways. We see that through news, but we also see that through the purchase of businesses. We see that through the co-opting of officials throughout the world. We've seen them very active in investment schemes -- that's what it is -- in different parts of the world where then that country's beholden for decades of debt.  </p><p>      So there's a very prolonged attempt.  </p><p>      What I would say the difference between the Chinese and the Russians, the Russians are much more brazen. They're much noisier about this. And they want to affect something here and now to disrupt American democracy and to give them and edge. The Chinese are playing a long game. They're in this for the long haul.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Well -- well, what you're describing is really a classic propaganda campaign, as opposed to attempts to break into and influence or gain intelligence from the voting system of the United States. Is that what really we're talking about here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  We -- again, we haven't seen any foreign influence attributed -- I just want to keep making that clear -- at the moment, but I also hesitate to give you an equivocal answer on that.  </p><p>      We just met with our Five Eyes partners in Australia a couple months ago. The conversation we have here about Russia, they have about China. They're very concerned about China doing what Russia did in our 2016 election in their election.  </p><p>      So again, China has the will. They have the capability. We haven't seen it on election infrastructure, but we have seen a very wide-ranging campaign very much targeted at the United States.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, John Bolton, the national security adviser, has also talked about attempts -- or at least concerns about attempts by Iran and North Korea to also interfere in the elections. Again, what's that a reference to exactly?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Well, you saw -- you know, you saw Facebook take down over 80 Iranian-facing accounts over that last -- like last Friday, very recently. They were not complying with the rules of Facebook. It was \"inauthentic content\" is the phrase that Facebook used.  </p><p>      So again, there are a lot of countries that are trying to influence how we vote, what we think, what we think about each other, how we carry on discourse. And unfortunately now we're seeing that from Iran as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So you're really talking, again, about foreign attempts to kind of affect the atmosphere of the political conversation in this country?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes. But the issues, of course, are tied to, in some cases, parts of the -- parts of various campaigns. If you are campaigning on a particular issue and one of these countries attempts to affect the discourse on that particular issue, it is, in some cases, a clear attempt to try to manipulate the way in which voters think.  </p><p>      So that's the tie to the election. We're seeing it much more aggressive leading up to the election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  But in the cases of Iran and North Korea, you're seeing it mostly in, sort of, this dark space online in the social media spheres and darker corners of the online conversation. Is it in...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I wouldn't say -- yes...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  ... fake personas, fake accounts, that sort of thing?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Fake personas, fake accounts. But what they have, I think they've caught onto some of our techniques. As you know, when we find a fake persona -- we the U.S. government -- share it with the platforms. We have conversations with them. If it violates their user rules, they'll pull it down.  </p><p>      I think the nation-states have become aware of that. So what they are doing now is they will take otherwise legitimate content by a non-nation-state actor and then they'll amplify it in a way to continue that conversation.  </p><p>      So it's very difficult because some of this, as you know, is protected by free speech, right? This is not terrorist use of the internet.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  But there's a question here as to whether Americans should have the right to know who is saying what and to be able to understand the context in which a news or just commentary's provided.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, in your -- in your own conversations with the big tech players in this space -- the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters -- how responsive have they been to this concern? And are you looking for more than you've gotten from them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, there -- it could always be more. But they have been tremendous partners, and we do partner with them on a variety of areas:  everything from child exploitation to terrorist use of the internet.  </p><p>      We also have started to work with them on a variety of capabilities they have, through A.I. and analytics, to actually spot fake personas before we become aware of them, so it's a much more proactive. I think you've heard some of the companies say they can now pull down content -- right? -- within minutes, before anyone even sees it.  </p><p>      So it's an ongoing conversation. We have a variety of ways in which we work with them. But they've taken a lot of leadership in this area to really not only use incoming technologies to address it, but to be very aware that this is a problem and they have no interest in having fake, disinformation campaigns posted on their platform.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, let's -- let's talk a little bit about next Tuesday, Election Day itself. So...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  First of all, I hope everyone is voting...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Very good.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  ... because the very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don't vote, right? So everyone should vote. Everyone should feel confident that state and locals are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure.  </p><p>      There's a variety of ways in which we will then assess that after the fact, per the president's direction, with the intel community, with FBI. But I -- you know, in terms of what -- and I didn't mean to cut you off, but point number one in vote.  </p><p>      Point number two, you know, FBI through their ops center has set up a way in which they're connected to all of their field offices. They're poised to be ready.  </p><p>      We've set up a virtual war room in our National Cyber Security and Communications Integration Center. And I'll forget everybody's that's in it, because everybody's in it. We have the FBI. We have all our federal partners. We have state and local election officials. We have the Election Assistance Commission. We have the DNC. We have the RNC. We have everybody together, so that as it evolves on Election Day, we can all very quickly respond if instant response is required or if we need to communicate in a way to make sure that folks do understand what's really happening.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, you mentioned earlier the bizarre characteristic about the American election system is that there isn't an American election system. There are 50, or if you count my town, the District of Columbia, 51, election systems.  </p><p>      That's a good thing, in the sense that you can't break into one -- you can't walk through one door and be in the whole house if you want to break into the system.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  On the other hand, it makes it very hard to figure out if something small has happened over here that it might be happening over there, but the person over here and the person over there don't necessarily have a way to communicate.  </p><p>      What have you done to fix that problem, to bring all the information together into one place? Which was a concern of a lot of state officials we talked to in 2016.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p>      So, bear with me for a second, because part of your answer is bureaucratic.   </p><p>      But we have set up all the government structures which we find is very, very important when it comes to critical infrastructure. Most of the critical infrastructure's owned by the private sector. The vendors are private. Each state does elections differently. Who's in charge of the elections can be different based county to county.  </p><p>      So we've set up a Government Coordinating Council, which brings the government side together; and then a Sector Coordinating Council, which brings the private sector together. That enables them to have rule-based (ph) conversations. Roles and responsibilities are clear.  </p><p>      And then we have worked with them to set up an Information-Sharing and Analysis Center. For those of you in the room who might be in the financial sector, you're very familiar with FS-ISAC. This is another way to do this.  </p><p>      But through this we can share real-time machine-to-machine threat indicators. So as something happens in one area, we can quickly share that profile of threat with all of our other partners.  </p><p>      It's the fastest-growing ISAC. We have all 50 states, we have over 1,300 counties working with us. It's a good news story.  </p><p>      But that allows that immediate sharing, that you see something, then everybody else has that essentially in their queue, in their sensors, in their network defense to look for as well.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  And just to be clear, that didn't exist in 2016?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  It did -- none of this existed in 2016 that I'm describing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  And so, on Election Day, let's assume that somebody in Connecticut thinks -- sees what they think was an attempt to break into the system by which people are casting and counting votes. That information goes where on Election Day? And who finds out in real time that something is happening that they ought to be on the lookout for?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So it is -- it is a voluntary partnership. And that's some thing I think -- I think is well understood at this point; that there was some confusion in 2016, there was concerns by state and locals that the federal government would somehow take over the constitutional role of state and locals to conduct elections. That's not what we're doing. It is a voluntary partnership.  </p><p>      But they know exactly who to call and how to send the information in a protected manner. We receive that immediately, we assess it, and then we push it back out to all the other states to protect them.  </p><p>      The other benefit we have now that we didn't have in 2016:  our pulling all of the information from the intel community. So, we have very advanced -- not only signatures and threat indicators from the intel community, but we also have access to their analysis and understanding in a somewhat predictive way, based on tactics of how some adversary might try to attack us in critical infrastructure. And that's at large.  </p><p>      But we pull all that together. They sit with us. We have many, many folks now that have clearances within the community. And those who don't, we have assured them that if we have credible actual information, we will immediately share. I'm not going to let a clearance, in that case, stand in the way. We have that information, many cases they're elected.  </p><p>      But we will push out that information. We did not have the mechanisms to that either in 2016.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Well, there's also been some question -- and again this is a bit of a bureaucratic question. But in -- in Washington there's been some question about whether funding is adequate to allow this system to really develop; will the states have the funding they need to secure their own systems, and whether there's been an adequately funded national effort to wire everything together.  </p><p>      Is there enough money in the system to do the kind of protective work you're talking about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So we're -- you know, we're working with the -- states need to tell us that. They know that. Their working through that problem set.  </p><p>      We have an entire catalog -- that's literally -- literally what it is -- of services that we're offering that are completely free. They can take us up on that. We'll tailor them. We'll work with them. But it's everything from hygiene scanning, phishing training, through to very in-depth vulnerability assessments and everything in between -- exercises, awareness.  </p><p>      But they also have in-house, in some cases, professionals who work with them. In some cases they've hired firms from the network defender community, from cyber-security. So they have to look at all of that, look at what they have, and then we ask them to tell us to communicate with us, \"What is it that you need?\"  </p><p>      So, we've seen some great examples where Rhode Island, for example, has been able to budget to upgrade their systems. We've seen other states that have taken (inaudible) where the state budget has provided a tremendous amount of information -- resources, but then asked the counties to match that, so it's both levels of government in on this.  </p><p>      But we've also seen states like Georgia throw a flag and say, \"Gosh, we really need to update all of our aging infrastructure.\" $60 million or $80 million that they came up with, and they're not able to budget for that.   </p><p>      So what we've said to states is, \"Please come up with the amounts that you need, what is it that you need, and we will help you work with Congress to make sure.\"  </p><p>      For 2020 what I've asked is that all states have auditable systems, because at the end of the day -- and I want to be clear...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Which means what? What's an auditable system?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  An auditable system means that when you vote, we have a way to go back after the -- after the fact to ensure that all votes were counted and were counted correctly.  </p><p>      There's a variety of different ways to do that. One is just paper ballots. So some states have gone back to paper ballots. It's, you know, old school, but you can count them. It's a piece of paper with your vote on it, and we can double-check that the count is correct.  </p><p>      Others are technology. So there are some machines where, as you vote, you can choose to essentially -- it's almost like lever that you pull, and it spits out a paper copy of your vote. You can then have access to that, and you can also give that to your polling place. Also it enables all of us to then verify that.  </p><p>      Many, many states have moved towards some sense of an auditable system, but there are still some counties and some states that don't have that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Should there be a national standard, a national system?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, the national system part is difficult, because each community votes differently.  </p><p>      And so, what we have done is given them best practices:  \"You need to meet these types of level of security; how you then do that, we'll work with you to make sure that it meets that.\"  </p><p>      So it's a softer version of a hard-line regulatory standard. But nonetheless, it's:  \"These are the 10 things you have to do at minimum to make sure that (inaudible).\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  And are states receptive to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yeah. So, we -- and actually they've been very helpful.  </p><p>      We also have a last-mile initiative. We've worked with the states to get to that part you had mentioned earlier, which is some of the much smaller counties are very unlikely to be resourced. So we've worked with states to go county by county and help them with an assessment on what additional activities or resources they could provide to get everybody up to speed.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, I want to turn to the members for questions, but let me ask one last broader question.  </p><p>      And when you step back from all of this and you think about in particular the foreign actors we've been talking about, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, there are a lot of pernicious aspects to their meddling. One is that people lose confidence in the system. One is that they don't trust the results. One is that they simply don't show up to vote because they fear their vote isn't going to count.  </p><p>      What is your biggest concern when you think about foreign actors attempting to interfere in the election system? What's the most pernicious thing you worry about?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  You know, it -- it's two things.  </p><p>      One, you know, this is basic cyber 101 what I'm going to say, but we've got to patch. We have to have systems configured correctly. We have to make sure that the access control and passwords are strong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  We just finished National Security -- or excuse me Cyber-Security Awareness Month. I was making the joke all month, but many people didn't seem to recognize it was joke, which is don't use \"password\" as your password. If \"Password\" is a capital P, still doesn't count.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      But people were actually surprised by that. \"Well, why not? You know, I've put a capital letter...\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      \"... with the word, so...\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Just a 1 at the end...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p>      So there's more educating that we need to do on the importance of a strong partner -- passwords.  </p><p>      My biggest concern is that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a particular area.  </p><p>      And on that, we've met, we've done exercises, we've done calls with all the news agencies, anybody reporting election results. We did an exercise last Friday to help them understand these are the legitimate ways in which you can receive official results.  </p><p>      If you get an e-mail from someone claiming to be an election official, understand you want to get the results out as quickly as possible, but please refrain, because we cannot verify that e-mail real-time from you that it comes from an election official.  </p><p>      So use the predesignated ways in which you should receive and report, and of course they'll also be with us in (inaudible). If you have any questions real-time, we can work through that.  </p><p>      But I think we have to not jump to conclusions as Americans. Again, there are operability issues. We saw one state recently with the way they -- their machines worked pre-voting, if you didn't give it enough time to load, you tried to get through your voting very quickly and click and you wanted to do an all-party option, it wasn't really allowing you to do that. That wasn't a cyber-security issue. It was just an operability issue.  </p><p>      So everyone, we just need to pause, I think, election night and not jump to conclusions.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  And the goal here if you're a foreign actor is to sow discord in the United States or to undermine the whole idea of democracy generally speaking?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I honestly think it's all of the above.  </p><p>      We definitely see it on the discord. We have seen them, interestingly, put material online that represents both ends of any particular issue, the full scheme, the full...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  They're not necessarily focused on getting you to believe X, and should you believe X or should you believe Y, if you kind of believe X, I'm going to get this -- you get my point.  </p><p>      But in terms of the democracy, I mean, 2016 showed us they absolutely were willing to attack the very essence of what makes our country a country, which is the sacredness of our elections. So I do think it's both.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  With that, let me open it to the floor.  </p><p>      Just a couple of reminders for the members here. This is on the record. Wait for a microphone; there'll be some moving around. State your name and your affiliation. And please make it a question -- singular.  </p><p>      So maybe start right there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Ann Cooper, Columbia Journalism School.  </p><p>      You've been talking about foreign threats. The president has spoken a lot about what he considers to be a domestic threat, which is the press in this country. And I wanted to ask if you share his view that he's stated that the press is the enemy of the people.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, first let me start by saying the remark that I saw him use was \"fake news is the enemy.\" There is something to be said -- none of us want to read something that's not true.  </p><p>      I think relationships with the press are very important. I tend to seek opportunities to engage with them.  </p><p>      I can tell you from the DHS portfolio with 23 different agencies and over 240,000 employees, we do a lot and it's not well-understood.  </p><p>      I really value the relationship with the press to help us get information out. Certainly in disaster response the press plays an extraordinarily important role for helping us to save lives. Should we ever have an attack -- but even when we saw with the bomber and the shooter, the role that the press played was extraordinarily helpful from our perspective.  </p><p>      So I actually think that it's a very useful relationship from a DHS mission perspective, and one that I try to be thankful for and also find other ways to help get messages out.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Why don't we go here and then here?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. David Shuman, Northwoods Capital.  </p><p>      Could you talk a little bit about the domestic terrorism threat and how DHS is configured to attack it; how many intelligence analysts you have working on the domestic intelligence threat?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p>      So one of the things that we did at DHS was we broadened our concept, first of all, of what that means. So from my perspective, hate is hate, violence is violence. It has no place in the United States.  </p><p>      So we've expanded our office to focus on preventing all forms of violence in the United States that are motivated by a terrorist act.  </p><p>      But it's not even just terrorists. It's -- you know, we look at white supremacists, we look at any ideology that lends itself or results in extreme violent behavior.  </p><p>      We have all of DHS focused on that. So we work with the FBI. We work with our joint terrorism task forces the FBI runs, as you know. We work through the fusion centers to push that information out. And we have very close relationships with state and local law enforcement and homeland security advisers.  </p><p>      The internet is -- has really made this space for us quite difficult, because in a moment like this, a terrorist or somebody who would seek to do an American harm worlds away can in a matter of seconds inspire somebody in the United States to commit an act. So we work on that.  </p><p>      That's a very different type of threat than what we saw, for example, in 9/11. It's very decentralized. It's much more difficult to attack. A lot of it's on the dark web. So we have a lot of capabilities we're building within the department to address it from that perspective.  </p><p>      But I think the only way that we win against those types of threats is by (inaudible), comprehensive, and recognizing that violence is violence and we can't stand for it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Here and then here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. I'm Paul Steiger from ProPublica.  </p><p>      The president has talked about mobilizing the Army to protect the borders. Talked about 5,000 troops, you know, maybe more. Do you need the Army? I mean, aren't you in a position to secure the border against a march by a couple thousand people?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, two things.  </p><p>      One is the -- the timing of the number of people. We're all -- I think everyone in the country is watching it to one extent or another. If they get on a train or they get on buses, they'll be here in a matter of days. If they stay on foot, they'll be here, you know, in a month or so.  </p><p>      So first we just have a capacity issue. When we're talking about those numbers either coming to a port of entry or trying to come between our ports of entry, no, we do not have the capacity and capability to address that type of a flow.  </p><p>      So what we've asked DOD to do is support us with engineering, support us with logistics, with planning. And then as a second phase, to help make sure that we can defend our ports of entry.  </p><p>      And that is because of what we've seen particularly in that second and third phase of the flows in Mexico that unfortunately did turn quite violent. By the time we're talking about Molotov cocktails and use of firearms, it's my duty to ensure that our (inaudible) agents are secure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  I would also note that part of our mission at DHS is to facilitate legal trade and travel. We do not want that legal trade and travel to be put at risk in any way by a mass flow of people. So it's a capacity-building, capability-building to ensure that we can continue to execute our mission.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Right here, and then there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Nina Gardner, professor of business and human rights at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington.  </p><p>      I wanted to ask you about family separations, and what were you thinking when you announced that policy without having a tracking system. I think our luggage at airports are taken care of more -- with more respect than the children that were separated. So I was wondering, what are you doing to reunify the children with their families now? And how do you stay up (sic) at night?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Well, thank you for the...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      ... way in which your question was asked.  </p><p>      I would say that at DHS, we enforce the law, and unfortunately, some parents chose to break the law and enter the country in a way that did not go to a port of entry.  </p><p>      We do have a tracking system. We take very good care of the children that come into our care.  </p><p>      The part that I really worry about, is last year we had 70,000 children dropped off at the border by smugglers and traffickers whose parents decided to send them alone on an extraordinarily dangerous journey. So we have about 13,000 of those who are in HHS care right now.  </p><p>      The tracking that we had, we used to ensure that families can be reunified if they do not have the ability to stay in the United States, so they can be reunited when they are removed. HHS has a tracking system to ensure that they quickly, and as fast as possible, reunite children with families or with sponsors in the United States, which, as you know, is what TVPRA requires.  </p><p>      In terms of reuniting on the back end, most all of the children have been reunited with families. The ones who have not, you know, we found about 80 percent of parents have now chosen for the third time that they do not want to be reunited with their children, and so those children remain in HHS care, and so HHS is trying to find safe sponsors for them and to give them good care.  </p><p>      When I talk to my partners in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, and I've called a couple ministerials over the past couple months -- they just came into town for a big conference -- we've really talked about, you know, how do we look at this regionally?  </p><p>      The goal of all of us should be to protect vulnerable populations, should be to have a system that enables us to keep families together, and should be able to ensure a safe and orderly process so that these vulnerable populations are helped as soon as possible.  </p><p>      The journey, as you know, is tremendously difficult and dangerous. We have about 30 percent of women who take that journey sexually abused, 17 percent of men, 70 percent of the migrants are victims of violence. So when I meet with UNHCR -- I met with the high commissioner again yesterday -- I've asked them for -- for -- since the whole time I've been secretary, \"Let's expand the asylum capacity throughout the regions so that we can help them as soon as possible on that journey, so that they're not forced to make decisions such as using a smuggler or using a trafficker, sending kids alone to the border.\"  </p><p>      So it's a work in progress. I'm hopeful that the partnership will continue to grow. We've had very pointed conversations on how to address that.  </p><p>      But you know, our -- our laws are difficult. We do need to -- and we've asked Congress to change the law so that we can keep families who choose to come here, however they come here, whether it's illegally or legally -- that we can keep them together while we process their claim.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Here, and then we'll go back there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I'm David Grupo (ph).  </p><p>      And you had said in your comments that the decentralization of voting systems is actually strange (ph). And you also said that you've seen the intent of a -- foreign attackers, nation attackers, and the attempt to attack and hack the systems around the country, right? But that they haven't...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Of somebody.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  But that they haven't succeeded, right?  </p><p>      And so the question is, does that then mean that your position is that the Russian state doesn't have sufficient technical skills to hack into, say, the Louisiana voting system, or a parish of Louisiana? Is that -- is that your -- is that what you're having us believe?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  No.  </p><p>      Actually, what I said is that nation-states have demonstrated both the will and the capability to attempt to disrupt or deny our election infrastructure. That's point number one.  </p><p>      So if I sit here today and I don't have any intel or any information from the state and locals that they are under some sort of scanning that we can attribute to foreign countries, what I'm actually saying is, don't let that mean anything other than what that means as a moment in time. We know they have the will. We know they have the capability. We need to continue to be prepared and think about resilience and redundancy in the system.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Right there, and then here (ph).  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you, Madam Secretary, for spending time with us this morning. I'm Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.  </p><p>      I appreciated what you said about 70 percent of the people coming up having been victims of violence. Listening to the president's remarks last night, a reasonable person could infer that 70 percent were perpetrators of violence.  </p><p>      The wave of immigration coming north has been called an invasion. A logical consequence of an invasion or a violent invasion would be an armed response.  </p><p>      Do you agree that it's an invasion that's coming north? And when the president says we're going to treat people with rocks as though they had rifles, that caught many in the military off-guard. What do you think that does to recruiting the new generation for military service when comments like that are made?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, I think on the first part, you know, to put it in perspective, we are apprehending about 1,500 to 2,000 illegal entrances a day. So just to put it in perspective, that's a daily number.  </p><p>      The -- the challenge with the caravan is it's a very amorphous concept. You don't get a ticket to the caravan. There's not a membership program. So what we're seeing are migrants who are potentially already on the flow, choose to be in the caravan, not choose to be in the caravan. You've seen numbers reported by the press as high as 15,000. I don't think the number is that high, based on our conversations with our partners in the region.  </p><p>      But I think what's difficult about this flow, or different about this flow, as you've seen talked about from everyone from President Hernandez through to Secretary Navarrete in Mexico, who's my counterpart -- one of my counterparts, is that that second and third flow are proving to be quite violent. They are covering their faces. They are, you know, attacking the -- the federal police. They're attacking the military in Mexico. They're putting the migrants who are in the caravan who are seeking asylum at risk.  </p><p>      So we're trying to work with the Mexicans to protect those who are legitimately seeking asylum to make sure that they have a way to do that as soon as possible. As you know, Mexico has offered asylum to everybody traveling north right now. We all, together, are encouraging migrants to take advantage of that for their own safety.  </p><p>      But we've also seen criminals in this flow. We have seen gang members. When I met with my counterparts in one of the countries in the region recently, they were very concerned because they had missing children. There were kidnappings, under a false belief that if you had a child, you would be able to come into the United States and stay.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So in general, mass migrations are dangerous for the migrants themselves. It needs to be safe. It needs to be orderly. That's the best way that we can protect them.  </p><p>      And again, the system is broken when we're requiring somebody who's seeking asylum to travel seven weeks through very -- a very difficult process, usually at the hands of smugglers.  </p><p>      So, we're working with UNHCR, working with the region to try to make sure that we can help those populations much sooner.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Right here and then here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good morning. Thanks for being here. I'm Nili Gilbert from Matarin Capital.  </p><p>      I wonder how do you see the U.S. electorate and the major pressures on our country 30 or 40 years from now? And if you had to build a long-term strategic plan for the Republican Party, how would it respond to those pressures? And how is the party moving towards that today?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, the one good news is that, despite the myriad of missions that we have at DHS, I do not have to do that one.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      So I would respectfully just refer you to the RNC. We don't -- we -- national security is bipartisan. Homeland Security is bipartisan. I don't get into the politics of it. We're just trying to secure the homeland. So respectfully I wouldn't have any comment on that.  </p><p>      What I can tell you is, from a Homeland Security perspective, what I really worry about is how quickly the threats are morphing and that perhaps our defenses are lagging behind. So part of what I feel very strongly is my responsibility is to make sure that DHS is resourced, that they have the tools they need and they have the authorities they need to combat these new threats.  </p><p>      So, for example, I'll give you a quick one, as you know, we just received authority to address the risk of nefarious unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States. We see them real-time dropping drugs and other illicit materials across the border. We see them surveilling sensitive locations. We have seen them weaponized throughout theaters -- theaters of war as close as Mexico. We've seen them armed with grenades. But we did not have the authority until about two weeks ago to either monitor or identify or interdict a drone that had a nefarious purpose in the United States.  </p><p>      So I think we have to have a system that's much more flexible. I encourage everyone at DHS to get on their toes, be really forward-thinking, double-down on the threats we know today, but really do that horizon-scanning and think about what is emerging so that we can make sure that we're prepared for it.  </p><p>      So that's my strategy in that sense. We call it relentless resilience, mixed with partnership, to make sure that we can cover down on all the threats we have in the homeland.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Here, and then over here next.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Paula DiPerna, NTR Foundation. Thank you for being here.  </p><p>      Back to issue of the military, regardless of the capacity issue and all the threats you've just described, it does feel like militarization of the Homeland Security -- militarization of our borders. And so, at what point would the military, say, be authorized to shoot to kill on the border? And who would authorize that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, the military -- of course, I would defer you to DOD for their rules of engagement.  </p><p>      But the military, of course, has always been allowed -- provided the opportunity to defend themselves, just as my Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers.  </p><p>      Our rules of engagement are published online. We're very transparent about what we do at the border and how we engage. I can't really speak more to DOD, but -- but our agents and officers are very clear.  </p><p>      I would say that assaults on our officers have gone -- continue to go up in some sectors. We had over 800 instances last year where they were attacked by those coming across the border. I do take their safety very seriously.   </p><p>      But again our rules of engagement are transparent and clear and are posted online.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  I think we're going there next, and then there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Madam Secretary, I thank you for being here. I'm Neil Christian (ph) from Veritas Capital.  </p><p>      When the president started talking initially about a wall, I always thought it was a metaphor for increased border security. And as time is going on, he actually seems to be talking about a real, concrete border wall on the southern border.  </p><p>      And I really appreciate all your eloquent responses today. I'd really love to hear whether you believe that would -- if he's actually talking about a physical wall that will go up, and whether that's an effective way to protect the southern border.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, I think what we need is a wall system. So, we need some sort of infrastructure. We need personnel and we need technology. And we continue to look a whole variety of technological uses, including drones in a positive way, to make sure that we have situational awareness of that border.  </p><p>      What I would tell you is in some of the areas at our border -- and all the border areas are quite different, first of all -- I mean, some is in the middle of the desert, some near natural barriers such as rivers, but some abut directly onto cities on both sides.  </p><p>      There's a term we use for that which is called vanishing time. The difficulty there is somebody can cross the border and disappear, either side, into an urban environment in a matter of minutes.  </p><p>      So the concept of impedance and denial becomes very important. And the first and foremost way to do that is to have an infrastructure of some sort that slows them down, that gives us the opportunity to detect an illegal entry, but also hopefully it deters them from attempting it to begin with. If they have a legitimate need to come, go to a port of entry. And if they don't have a legitimate need to come -- this particularly we see a lot of unfortunate traffic that way of the smugglers, the traffickers and the transnational criminal organizations.  </p><p>      So, I think that there's a combination. The president has been clear we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea, but there are some areas where that impedance and denial is the difference between being able to secure the border and not being able to secure the border. But its only one part, and that's why I say we also need the personnel and technology, the sensors, the lights, the roads, the ability to apprehend, and the ability to have that situational awareness all across the border.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  There, and then back there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Patricia Rosenfield, Rosenfield Fund.  </p><p>      I also want to thank you very much for this very clear and eloquent meeting. But I wanted to ask about a more perhaps conceptual concern I have, and that is the pervasiveness of fear and lack of confidence in the democratic system that we know. It certainly (ph) seems to be such an issue that might prevent voting as we've talked about. But also fear (inaudible) the caravan, other issues that might require a stronger partnership with local community organizations and nonprofits, foundations, you seem to have a very effective system for intergovernmental coordination, even with local level actors internationally.  </p><p>      Just wondering how are you in department reaching out to the local -- to citizens?  </p><p>      You said that Homeland Security is not that well understood. So I'm just wondering how are you doing that? How are you working that? How are you reaching out to the -- not the corporate but the nongovernmental nonprofit sector? And how is that working? And what could be done to make it stronger?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yes, so that is a great question.  </p><p>      You know, as I mentioned, everything we do at DHS we have to do in partnership because no one entity can address all these threats.  </p><p>      I'll give you an example on immigration.  </p><p>      So I have personally, as have my component heads, been in very close contact with many NGOs, with foundations. We've asked them to be part of the conversation. We've brought them into various conferences we've had within the Northern Triangle. They play an extraordinarily important role, not just for taking care of the vulnerable populations as they travel, but also working with us in communities, both for receiving those who are coming here to claim asylum, as well as for those who are being repatriated back to the countries.  </p><p>      So the first ladies, particular of Guatemala, but Honduras as well, are very active. I, with them, also have conversations with the NGO community. We've asked the foundations to -- to step up. We've asked them, you know, \"What -- what additional role are you willing to play? How can you help us get additional resources to these populations? How can you help us message to them about the right way to do things?\" For example, in this particular instance, to help them understand what Mexico is offering, in terms of jobs and asylum, so that we can limit the violence on those populations.  </p><p>      So it's a very important role, and then I could, kind of, go through each mission set at DHS and the role they play. But I think more and more, the communities -- you know, we say \"hometown security.\" If we don't have hometown security, we don't have homeland security.  </p><p>      So again, immigration is an example. I meet with the ranchers, I meet with the sheriffs, I meet with the landowners to try to understand what they're seeing. What are their environments like? What are they concerned about? What can we do better, in partnership with them, to protect their constituents, as they do that every day as part of their main mission.  </p><p>      So I think that's crucial. I don't know that we necessarily had leveraged that community as well as we needed to in the past. So it's a very clear focus right now, particularly with respect to the human rights situation, and how we can really work with them and -- and learn from their expertise.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Can I just ask one quick follow-up?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  You -- you've mentioned a couple of times your conversations with your Central American colleagues. Are they doing enough, in your estimation, to actually reduce the flow -- the outflow of -- of migrants?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  They are -- it's a capacity issue. Nobody is really generally -- has the capacity for these numbers that we're talking about. But they're working very hard.  </p><p>      We have -- we're in daily contact with all of the countries. We roll up what they're doing. They're trying a variety of different tactics and techniques in their communities to provide for those who would otherwise choose to leave.  </p><p>      We have been very interested in some of the U.N. data that has come out, for example, that says that many of the migrants that make their way into the United States do so because of lack of food. And so we work with the countries to find out, \"Well, how can we address that more systemically?\"  </p><p>      And at the end of the day, it's about building prosperity and stability in the region. So we've brought the private sector in. I've spent a lot of time talking to American companies about how, and would they consider investing further in the area. We've been working very closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to the same end.  </p><p>      But we -- we have to make it so that migration is -- is a choice; it's not believed by anyone to be a need. So that's, you know, ensuring that they have opportunity and -- and what they need in the region.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  Right here, and then probably this will be our last question there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  My name's Phyllis Costanza, and I'm with UBS Optimus Foundation.  </p><p>      And I think a lot of resources for foundations, coming back to your point, are being spent on rehabilitation of children who are traumatized. And what's important is this issue of prevention; not having to put resources into rehabilitating children.  </p><p>      So how are you working, specifically with organizations like USAID and other government entities, to prevent, in the first place, children from being traumatized?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  Yeah, I mean, I think a -- a couple different ways.  </p><p>      The goal is -- as you know, with aid, is to do it in a targeted way with metrics so that we can then scale it and expand it if something works, or we can revise it and retarget it if it didn't produce the results that we wanted.  </p><p>      So the conversation to be had with USAID and the Alliance for Prosperity in general are very much about what's working, what's working from the local perspective, and how can we expand that.  </p><p>      We've seen some very interesting programs out of the Northern Triangle using USAID funding, for example, to have micro-competitions -- business competitions. And if you win the competition, you will receive $12,000, which is the -- which is tied to and is that same amount in that area that you would pay a smuggler to come to the United States.  </p><p>      So we're trying to provide additional opportunity there as an alternative and to help them understand that they have another alternative.  </p><p>      But the -- the conversation needs to continue to evolve. You know, what is the best way, what are the actual push factors in the region, and how can we -- again, it's stabilization, it's building prosperity, economic opportunity, continuing to help them reduce violence.  </p><p>      We've seen some very good news statistics on decreases in murder rates in particular parts of the Northern Triangle. Everybody needs to do more to get those numbers down even lower. So what can we do there to help build capacity, for example, for law enforcement to help ensure that there's a safe environment?  </p><p>      So it's an ongoing conversation, but I think what we're doing is learning from the foundations who are also there on the ground what is it that you're seeing and what works and what can we be doing to help the region?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So final question right there. Wait a second. There you go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Daniel Holtzman, Bank of America.  </p><p>      In the 2019 budget, you asked for almost a billion dollars, or a 10 percent increase, 3,300 people, 52,000 beds. Is -- what -- is -- what -- why do we still need the Army with increases like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NIELSEN</emphasis>:  So, as you might know, there's a difference between a request -- requesting an appropriation and having an appropriation. We don't have an appropriation at DHS yet. We're still in a continued resolution. So we are hopeful that Congress will pass an appropriation in December.  </p><p>      The key to this issue at the end of the day is to be able to apprehend those who do not have a legal right, to detain them and then to very quickly process them.  </p><p>      And expeditious processing is important, because the system is so backlogged that when you have somebody who is within our country for many, many years, it complicates the ability for us to remove them. They've likely now have roots in the community. We don't always have the ability to know where they are if they fail to appear for a variety of engagements that are preplanned, predesignated notices to appear to courts, et cetera.  </p><p>      So the key is to apprehend those who do not have a legal right to stay, be able to detain them, to keep them in a process with the courts that is very expedited.  </p><p>      And again, I don't mean to get into too much detail. This is extraordinarily complicated. But the detained docket goes much more quickly than the non-detained docket.  </p><p>      So the fastest way to process through our system is to be detained, so the courts will very quickly hear your case adjudicated. And then the court, of course, makes the decision to deport, not DHS. The court will give us a final order of removal for a particular person and then we seek to remove them.  </p><p>      So it's a little bit of apples and oranges. One is trying to address a potential massive flow that could be here in a number of days, and the other is a more systemic issue that we need to work with Congress on to address those pull factors.  </p><p>      Again, as I mentioned, we want to be able to keep families together. We want to be able to treat non-Mexicans the same as we treat Mexicans. There's different legal procedures for different nationalities right now that adds a lot of complexity to the system. Many who arrive at our border don't have paperwork, so we want to make sure we do that.  </p><p>      And then with UACs, we want to -- sorry, unaccompanied children -- we want to make sure that we can take care of them as quickly as possible in the best way possible. And there's some limits on how we can do that with that 13,000 that we have now.  </p><p>      So we've asked for some very specific fixes of Congress. That's the legislative side. We have the appropriations side. Then we have the immediate potential surge right now that we're trying to make sure we're prepared for.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SEIB</emphasis>:  So, we've reached the 9 o'clock hour.

Welcome to today's Council on Foreign Relations Meeting with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NIELSEN:  My pleasure.</p><p>SEIB:  I'm Jerry Seib, Washington -- executive Washington editor of the Wall Street Journal.  I'm the moderator today, and I'll be presiding.</p><p>You know, the topic of today's conversation, as we agreed initially, is cyber-security and safeguarding U.S. elections, which we'll talk about because it's very timely, and -- and as we were just discussing, of broad significance around the country.  There are some other issues.  Border issues probably will come up.  But we'll have plenty of time in the audience Q&amp;amp;A to deal with issues beyond -- beyond cyber-security and elections.</p><p>But again, thank you for being here.</p><p>Let's talk about elections, because we are, as we speak, four days from what I think is a very charged and high-stakes election.  Can Americans be confident their votes will count, that the system will hold, that there won't be interference, and that there won't be problems on Election Day?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, first of all, I just say we actually have an even higher bar.</p><p>SEIB:  OK.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we want to make sure that everyone's vote is counted, but is also counted correctly.</p><p>So as many of you know, there were concerns that proved unfounded, but as we see throughout the rest of the world with some of the attempts to hack the election infrastructure, there's also concern about the integrity.  So we want to vote to count, we want it counted correctly.</p><p>What (inaudible), this is going to be the most secure election we've ever had.  But as we all know, with this dynamic threat, it changes by the minute.</p><p>So as of today, we don't have any -- any indication that a foreign government has a sustained effort or a sustained plan to hack our election infrastructure.  But having said that, the moment it changes, we, of course, will let our state and local partners know.</p><p>SEIB:  So, you know, you have said that the Russians probably attempted in 2016 to gain access to voting systems in all 50 states.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes, yes.</p><p>SEIB:  And they were, in fact, successful in a couple of cases.  What are they doing now?  And what did you learn from that 2016 experience?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah, so I think there's -- if I could, let me just back up and divide it into a couple different threats.</p><p>So the threat that DHS focuses on is any interference into the election infrastructure.  So we work with our state and local partners, election officials, the Election Assistance Commission; I can go into a variety of other groups that we work with.  But what we're trying to make sure is that that infrastructure, the voting -- the voter databases, the polling infrastructure, the voting machines are all secure.</p><p>The other threat, though, that we're facing, which is much more difficult to get our hands around, is the very pernicious attempts at influence by foreign governments.  And this takes a variety of means.  FBI has lead on that.</p><p>That's much more difficult.  A lot of that, at the end of the day, is about educating the American public to think -- to think about what you're reading, think about the source, think about where it's coming from.</p><p>R.T., as you know, which is a self-proclaimed state agent of Russia, if you can believe it, in 2017 had more views on YouTube than CNN -- double the -- double amount of views.  But that is a directly state-sponsored news agency.</p><p>So the -- that is much more difficult to combat.  And that's China, that's Russia.  We see that with Iran.  We see the recent tape -- takedowns from Facebook.</p><p>So that's the FBI lead we support.  I think we need to continue, as a country, to figure out how to combat that part.</p><p>But the election infrastructure, we've done a tremendous amount at the front end of training, and then all the way through to Election Day, where we'll have a war room set up.</p><p>SEIB:  So I want to talk about Election Day and election night in a bit.  </p><p>But, you know, the -- the -- there was a -- a -- an indictment this summer of a couple of Russian cyber -- cyber activists who were affiliated with the Russian military, and that indictment said there was personal data from half a million voters hacked in 2016, probably -- I'm assuming it's Illinois.  Illinois thinks that's the state that was referred to.  So that was an illustration:  You've got a voter data, and you've got actual voting systems, and they're not the same thing, which is probably not well understood.  Which is more vulnerable, and can you protect both at the same time?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So many of the vulnerabilities or the ways in which you might attack the systems are very similar, and we see that across infrastructure.  So, as many of you know, DHS has lead for security and resilience for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our country, and many of these tactics and techniques are the same.</p><p>What I would say about the voter databases is is that there's a lot of redundancy built in there.</p><p>Every state gives you the right to vote on a provisional ballot, those that don't allow you to do same-day registration to vote.  So if there's any reason why an American should show up to voting place and be told they're not on the rolls, they can still vote.  And then we'll determine if there was an issue, and sometimes those issues are operability issues.  We've seen some data glitches in some of the states.  It had nothing to do with security, per se, but that's why we have provisional ballots.  So there's some redundancy built in there.</p><p>On the election systems themselves, what I would say is they're still very decentralized, right?  So the good news is that this is not a situation where we have any indication a capability exists to, at one time, if you will, take down the voting infrastructure throughout the nation.  The systems just aren't connected in that way.  It would have to be a -- a very different level of attack and capability that we've seen.</p><p>But we have seen will.  We have seen the capability to disrupt.  And so that's what we continue to work on.SEIB:  So -- so let me try to be a little more clear here.</p><p>As we speak today, have you seen attempts to hack into either voter databases in any of the 50 states or into the actual apparatus of casting and counting votes in any of the 50 states?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, what we've seen is continued attempts to scan, you know, to access the systems.  You know, that's kind of like a burglar, you know, walking around your house and trying your windows.</p><p>In some very limited cases, we have seen access, but they have been quickly prevented or mitigated.</p><p>SEIB:  You have seen access, so people have gotten...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Not -- but not that we can attribute to a foreign country.</p><p>So this is the general -- you know, if you talk to a bank or you talk to somebody in the energy infrastructure, we're under constant attack and I can't stress that enough.  So what would be strange is if we didn't see any attempts.</p><p>And again, remember how the systems work.  If you have an election site on your government -- e-government site, there could be lots of reasons why people are trying to access that.  They could just be trying to steal, for example, people's utility information or Social Security numbers, which we also work on but might not be related to elections.</p><p>As of today, we do not have any activity that we're attributing in the election infrastructure to a foreign entity.  But again that could change in an hour, so we're -- it's very dynamic and we're continuing to watch.</p><p>SEIB:  So, the president made some waves here in New York a few weeks ago when he said he's worried about Chinese interference in the 2018 midterm elections.  What was he referring to?</p><p>NIELSEN:  The same thing.</p><p>So, the Chinese have a very sustained, persistent campaign through foreign influence techniques to change the way in which Americans think about China and particularly to change our policies with respect to China.</p><p>We see that in a lot of ways.  We see that through news, but we also see that through the purchase of businesses.  We see that through the co-opting of officials throughout the world.  We've seen them very active in investment schemes -- that's what it is -- in different parts of the world where then that country's beholden for decades of debt.</p><p>So there's a very prolonged attempt.</p><p>What I would say the difference between the Chinese and the Russians, the Russians are much more brazen.  They're much noisier about this.  And they want to affect something here and now to disrupt American democracy and to give them and edge.  The Chinese are playing a long game.  They're in this for the long haul.</p><p>SEIB:  Well -- well, what you're describing is really a classic propaganda campaign, as opposed to attempts to break into and influence or gain intelligence from the voting system of the United States.  Is that what really we're talking about here?</p><p>NIELSEN:  We -- again, we haven't seen any foreign influence attributed -- I just want to keep making that clear -- at the moment, but I also hesitate to give you an equivocal answer on that.</p><p>We just met with our Five Eyes partners in Australia a couple months ago.  The conversation we have here about Russia, they have about China.  They're very concerned about China doing what Russia did in our 2016 election in their election.</p><p>So again, China has the will.  They have the capability.  We haven't seen it on election infrastructure, but we have seen a very wide-ranging campaign very much targeted at the United States.</p><p>SEIB:  So, John Bolton, the national security adviser, has also talked about attempts -- or at least concerns about attempts by Iran and North Korea to also interfere in the elections.  Again, what's that a reference to exactly?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, you saw -- you know, you saw Facebook take down over 80 Iranian-facing accounts over that last -- like last Friday, very recently.  They were not complying with the rules of Facebook.  It was \"inauthentic content\" is the phrase that Facebook used.</p><p>So again, there are a lot of countries that are trying to influence how we vote, what we think, what we think about each other, how we carry on discourse.  And unfortunately now we're seeing that from Iran as well.</p><p>SEIB:  So you're really talking, again, about foreign attempts to kind of affect the atmosphere of the political conversation in this country?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.  But the issues, of course, are tied to, in some cases, parts of the -- parts of various campaigns.  If you are campaigning on a particular issue and one of these countries attempts to affect the discourse on that particular issue, it is, in some cases, a clear attempt to try to manipulate the way in which voters think.</p><p>So that's the tie to the election.  We're seeing it much more aggressive leading up to the election.</p><p>SEIB:  But in the cases of Iran and North Korea, you're seeing it mostly in, sort of, this dark space online in the social media spheres and darker corners of the online conversation.  Is it in...</p><p>NIELSEN:  I wouldn't say -- yes...</p><p>SEIB:  ... fake personas, fake accounts, that sort of thing?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Fake personas, fake accounts.  But what they have, I think they've caught onto some of our techniques.  As you know, when we find a fake persona -- we the U.S. government -- share it with the platforms.  We have conversations with them.  If it violates their user rules, they'll pull it down.</p><p>I think the nation-states have become aware of that.  So what they are doing now is they will take otherwise legitimate content by a non-nation-state actor and then they'll amplify it in a way to continue that conversation.</p><p>So it's very difficult because some of this, as you know, is protected by free speech, right?  This is not terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>SEIB:  Right.</p><p>NIELSEN:  But there's a question here as to whether Americans should have the right to know who is saying what and to be able to understand the context in which a news or just commentary's provided.</p><p>SEIB:  So, in your -- in your own conversations with the big tech players in this space -- the Googles, the Facebooks, the Twitters -- how responsive have they been to this concern?  And are you looking for more than you've gotten from them?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, there -- it could always be more.  But they have been tremendous partners, and we do partner with them on a variety of areas:  everything from child exploitation to terrorist use of the internet.</p><p>We also have started to work with them on a variety of capabilities they have, through A.I. and analytics, to actually spot fake personas before we become aware of them, so it's a much more proactive.  I think you've heard some of the companies say they can now pull down content -- right? -- within minutes, before anyone even sees it.</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation.  We have a variety of ways in which we work with them.  But they've taken a lot of leadership in this area to really not only use incoming technologies to address it, but to be very aware that this is a problem and they have no interest in having fake, disinformation campaigns posted on their platform.</p><p>SEIB:  So, let's -- let's talk a little bit about next Tuesday, Election Day itself.  So...</p><p>NIELSEN:  First of all, I hope everyone is voting...</p><p>SEIB:  Very good.</p><p>NIELSEN:  ... because the very important thing here is the adversary wins if we don't vote, right?  So everyone should vote.  Everyone should feel confident that state and locals are doing everything they can to secure the infrastructure.</p><p>There's a variety of ways in which we will then assess that after the fact, per the president's direction, with the intel community, with FBI.  But I -- you know, in terms of what -- and I didn't mean to cut you off, but point number one in vote.</p><p>Point number two, you know, FBI through their ops center has set up a way in which they're connected to all of their field offices.  They're poised to be ready.</p><p>We've set up a virtual war room in our National Cyber Security and Communications Integration Center.  And I'll forget everybody's that's in it, because everybody's in it.  We have the FBI.  We have all our federal partners.  We have state and local election officials.  We have the Election Assistance Commission.  We have the DNC.  We have the RNC.  We have everybody together, so that as it evolves on Election Day, we can all very quickly respond if instant response is required or if we need to communicate in a way to make sure that folks do understand what's really happening.SEIB:  So, you mentioned earlier the bizarre characteristic about the American election system is that there isn't an American election system.  There are 50, or if you count my town, the District of Columbia, 51, election systems.</p><p>That's a good thing, in the sense that you can't break into one -- you can't walk through one door and be in the whole house if you want to break into the system.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Right.</p><p>SEIB:  On the other hand, it makes it very hard to figure out if something small has happened over here that it might be happening over there, but the person over here and the person over there don't necessarily have a way to communicate.</p><p>What have you done to fix that problem, to bring all the information together into one place?  Which was a concern of a lot of state officials we talked to in 2016.</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yes.</p><p>So, bear with me for a second, because part of your answer is bureaucratic.  </p><p>But we have set up all the government structures which we find is very, very important when it comes to critical infrastructure.  Most of the critical infrastructure's owned by the private sector.  The vendors are private.  Each state does elections differently.  Who's in charge of the elections can be different based county to county.</p><p>So we've set up a Government Coordinating Council, which brings the government side together; and then a Sector Coordinating Council, which brings the private sector together.  That enables them to have rule-based (ph) conversations.  Roles and responsibilities are clear.</p><p>And then we have worked with them to set up an Information-Sharing and Analysis Center.  For those of you in the room who might be in the financial sector, you're very familiar with FS-ISAC.  This is another way to do this.</p><p>But through this we can share real-time machine-to-machine threat indicators.  So as something happens in one area, we can quickly share that profile of threat with all of our other partners.</p><p>It's the fastest-growing ISAC.  We have all 50 states, we have over 1,300 counties working with us.  It's a good news story.</p><p>But that allows that immediate sharing, that you see something, then everybody else has that essentially in their queue, in their sensors, in their network defense to look for as well.</p><p>SEIB:  And just to be clear, that didn't exist in 2016?</p><p>NIELSEN:  It did -- none of this existed in 2016 that I'm describing.</p><p>SEIB:  And so, on Election Day, let's assume that somebody in Connecticut thinks -- sees what they think was an attempt to break into the system by which people are casting and counting votes.  That information goes where on Election Day?  And who finds out in real time that something is happening that they ought to be on the lookout for?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So it is -- it is a voluntary partnership.  And that's some thing I think -- I think is well understood at this point; that there was some confusion in 2016, there was concerns by state and locals that the federal government would somehow take over the constitutional role of state and locals to conduct elections.  That's not what we're doing.  It is a voluntary partnership.</p><p>But they know exactly who to call and how to send the information in a protected manner.  We receive that immediately, we assess it, and then we push it back out to all the other states to protect them.</p><p>The other benefit we have now that we didn't have in 2016:  our pulling all of the information from the intel community.  So, we have very advanced -- not only signatures and threat indicators from the intel community, but we also have access to their analysis and understanding in a somewhat predictive way, based on tactics of how some adversary might try to attack us in critical infrastructure.  And that's at large.</p><p>But we pull all that together.  They sit with us.  We have many, many folks now that have clearances within the community.  And those who don't, we have assured them that if we have credible actual information, we will immediately share.  I'm not going to let a clearance, in that case, stand in the way.  We have that information, many cases they're elected.</p><p>But we will push out that information.  We did not have the mechanisms to that either in 2016.</p><p>SEIB:  Well, there's also been some question -- and again this is a bit of a bureaucratic question.  But in -- in Washington there's been some question about whether funding is adequate to allow this system to really develop; will the states have the funding they need to secure their own systems, and whether there's been an adequately funded national effort to wire everything together.</p><p>Is there enough money in the system to do the kind of protective work you're talking about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So we're -- you know, we're working with the -- states need to tell us that.  They know that.  Their working through that problem set.</p><p>We have an entire catalog -- that's literally -- literally what it is -- of services that we're offering that are completely free.  They can take us up on that.  We'll tailor them.  We'll work with them.  But it's everything from hygiene scanning, phishing training, through to very in-depth vulnerability assessments and everything in between -- exercises, awareness.</p><p>But they also have in-house, in some cases, professionals who work with them.  In some cases they've hired firms from the network defender community, from cyber-security.  So they have to look at all of that, look at what they have, and then we ask them to tell us to communicate with us, \"What is it that you need?\"</p><p>So, we've seen some great examples where Rhode Island, for example, has been able to budget to upgrade their systems.  We've seen other states that have taken (inaudible) where the state budget has provided a tremendous amount of information -- resources, but then asked the counties to match that, so it's both levels of government in on this.</p><p>But we've also seen states like Georgia throw a flag and say, \"Gosh, we really need to update all of our aging infrastructure.\"  $60 million or $80 million that they came up with, and they're not able to budget for that.  </p><p>So what we've said to states is, \"Please come up with the amounts that you need, what is it that you need, and we will help you work with Congress to make sure.\"</p><p>For 2020 what I've asked is that all states have auditable systems, because at the end of the day -- and I want to be clear...</p><p>SEIB:  Which means what?  What's an auditable system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  An auditable system means that when you vote, we have a way to go back after the -- after the fact to ensure that all votes were counted and were counted correctly.</p><p>There's a variety of different ways to do that.  One is just paper ballots.  So some states have gone back to paper ballots.  It's, you know, old school, but you can count them.  It's a piece of paper with your vote on it, and we can double-check that the count is correct.</p><p>Others are technology.  So there are some machines where, as you vote, you can choose to essentially -- it's almost like lever that you pull, and it spits out a paper copy of your vote.  You can then have access to that, and you can also give that to your polling place.  Also it enables all of us to then verify that.</p><p>Many, many states have moved towards some sense of an auditable system, but there are still some counties and some states that don't have that.</p><p>SEIB:  Should there be a national standard, a national system?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the national system part is difficult, because each community votes differently.</p><p>And so, what we have done is given them best practices:  \"You need to meet these types of level of security; how you then do that, we'll work with you to make sure that it meets that.\"</p><p>So it's a softer version of a hard-line regulatory standard.  But nonetheless, it's:  \"These are the 10 things you have to do at minimum to make sure that (inaudible).\"</p><p>SEIB:  And are states receptive to that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah.  So, we -- and actually they've been very helpful.</p><p>We also have a last-mile initiative.  We've worked with the states to get to that part you had mentioned earlier, which is some of the much smaller counties are very unlikely to be resourced.  So we've worked with states to go county by county and help them with an assessment on what additional activities or resources they could provide to get everybody up to speed.</p><p>SEIB:  So, I want to turn to the members for questions, but let me ask one last broader question.</p><p>And when you step back from all of this and you think about in particular the foreign actors we've been talking about, Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, there are a lot of pernicious aspects to their meddling.  One is that people lose confidence in the system.  One is that they don't trust the results.  One is that they simply don't show up to vote because they fear their vote isn't going to count.</p><p>What is your biggest concern when you think about foreign actors attempting to interfere in the election system?  What's the most pernicious thing you worry about?</p><p>NIELSEN:  You know, it -- it's two things.</p><p>One, you know, this is basic cyber 101 what I'm going to say, but we've got to patch.  We have to have systems configured correctly.  We have to make sure that the access control and passwords are strong.NIELSEN:  We just finished National Security -- or excuse me Cyber-Security Awareness Month.  I was making the joke all month, but many people didn't seem to recognize it was joke, which is don't use \"password\" as your password.  If \"Password\" is a capital P, still doesn't count.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But people were actually surprised by that.  \"Well, why not?  You know, I've put a capital letter...\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>\"... with the word, so...\"</p><p>SEIB:  Just a 1 at the end...</p><p>NIELSEN:  That's right.</p><p>So there's more educating that we need to do on the importance of a strong partner -- passwords.</p><p>My biggest concern is that a foreign entity will take the opportunity after the election or the night of the election to attempt to sow discord through social media by suggesting that something did not work as it should in a particular area.</p><p>And on that, we've met, we've done exercises, we've done calls with all the news agencies, anybody reporting election results.  We did an exercise last Friday to help them understand these are the legitimate ways in which you can receive official results.</p><p>If you get an e-mail from someone claiming to be an election official, understand you want to get the results out as quickly as possible, but please refrain, because we cannot verify that e-mail real-time from you that it comes from an election official.</p><p>So use the predesignated ways in which you should receive and report, and of course they'll also be with us in (inaudible).  If you have any questions real-time, we can work through that.</p><p>But I think we have to not jump to conclusions as Americans.  Again, there are operability issues.  We saw one state recently with the way they -- their machines worked pre-voting, if you didn't give it enough time to load, you tried to get through your voting very quickly and click and you wanted to do an all-party option, it wasn't really allowing you to do that.  That wasn't a cyber-security issue.  It was just an operability issue.</p><p>So everyone, we just need to pause, I think, election night and not jump to conclusions.</p><p>SEIB:  And the goal here if you're a foreign actor is to sow discord in the United States or to undermine the whole idea of democracy generally speaking?</p><p>NIELSEN:  I honestly think it's all of the above.</p><p>We definitely see it on the discord.  We have seen them, interestingly, put material online that represents both ends of any particular issue, the full scheme, the full...</p><p>SEIB:  Yes.</p><p>NIELSEN:  They're not necessarily focused on getting you to believe X, and should you believe X or should you believe Y, if you kind of believe X, I'm going to get this -- you get my point.</p><p>But in terms of the democracy, I mean, 2016 showed us they absolutely were willing to attack the very essence of what makes our country a country, which is the sacredness of our elections.  So I do think it's both.</p><p>SEIB:  With that, let me open it to the floor.</p><p>Just a couple of reminders for the members here.  This is on the record.  Wait for a microphone; there'll be some moving around.  State your name and your affiliation.  And please make it a question -- singular.</p><p>So maybe start right there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Ann Cooper, Columbia Journalism School.</p><p>You've been talking about foreign threats.  The president has spoken a lot about what he considers to be a domestic threat, which is the press in this country.  And I wanted to ask if you share his view that he's stated that the press is the enemy of the people.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, first let me start by saying the remark that I saw him use was \"fake news is the enemy.\"  There is something to be said -- none of us want to read something that's not true.</p><p>I think relationships with the press are very important.  I tend to seek opportunities to engage with them.</p><p>I can tell you from the DHS portfolio with 23 different agencies and over 240,000 employees, we do a lot and it's not well-understood.</p><p>I really value the relationship with the press to help us get information out.  Certainly in disaster response the press plays an extraordinarily important role for helping us to save lives.  Should we ever have an attack -- but even when we saw with the bomber and the shooter, the role that the press played was extraordinarily helpful from our perspective.</p><p>So I actually think that it's a very useful relationship from a DHS mission perspective, and one that I try to be thankful for and also find other ways to help get messages out.</p><p>SEIB:  Why don't we go here and then here?</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  David Shuman, Northwoods Capital.</p><p>Could you talk a little bit about the domestic terrorism threat and how DHS is configured to attack it; how many intelligence analysts you have working on the domestic intelligence threat?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Sure.</p><p>So one of the things that we did at DHS was we broadened our concept, first of all, of what that means.  So from my perspective, hate is hate, violence is violence.  It has no place in the United States.</p><p>So we've expanded our office to focus on preventing all forms of violence in the United States that are motivated by a terrorist act.</p><p>But it's not even just terrorists.  It's -- you know, we look at white supremacists, we look at any ideology that lends itself or results in extreme violent behavior.</p><p>We have all of DHS focused on that.  So we work with the FBI.  We work with our joint terrorism task forces the FBI runs, as you know.  We work through the fusion centers to push that information out.  And we have very close relationships with state and local law enforcement and homeland security advisers.</p><p>The internet is -- has really made this space for us quite difficult, because in a moment like this, a terrorist or somebody who would seek to do an American harm worlds away can in a matter of seconds inspire somebody in the United States to commit an act.  So we work on that.</p><p>That's a very different type of threat than what we saw, for example, in 9/11.  It's very decentralized.  It's much more difficult to attack.  A lot of it's on the dark web.  So we have a lot of capabilities we're building within the department to address it from that perspective.</p><p>But I think the only way that we win against those types of threats is by (inaudible), comprehensive, and recognizing that violence is violence and we can't stand for it.</p><p>SEIB:  Here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi.  I'm Paul Steiger from ProPublica.</p><p>The president has talked about mobilizing the Army to protect the borders.  Talked about 5,000 troops, you know, maybe more.  Do you need the Army?  I mean, aren't you in a position to secure the border against a march by a couple thousand people?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, two things.</p><p>One is the -- the timing of the number of people.  We're all -- I think everyone in the country is watching it to one extent or another.  If they get on a train or they get on buses, they'll be here in a matter of days.  If they stay on foot, they'll be here, you know, in a month or so.</p><p>So first we just have a capacity issue.  When we're talking about those numbers either coming to a port of entry or trying to come between our ports of entry, no, we do not have the capacity and capability to address that type of a flow.</p><p>So what we've asked DOD to do is support us with engineering, support us with logistics, with planning.  And then as a second phase, to help make sure that we can defend our ports of entry.</p><p>And that is because of what we've seen particularly in that second and third phase of the flows in Mexico that unfortunately did turn quite violent.  By the time we're talking about Molotov cocktails and use of firearms, it's my duty to ensure that our (inaudible) agents are secure.NIELSEN:  I would also note that part of our mission at DHS is to facilitate legal trade and travel.  We do not want that legal trade and travel to be put at risk in any way by a mass flow of people.  So it's a capacity-building, capability-building to ensure that we can continue to execute our mission.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Nina Gardner, professor of business and human rights at Johns Hopkins SAIS in Washington.</p><p>I wanted to ask you about family separations, and what were you thinking when you announced that policy without having a tracking system.  I think our luggage at airports are taken care of more -- with more respect than the children that were separated.  So I was wondering, what are you doing to reunify the children with their families now?  And how do you stay up (sic) at night?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Well, thank you for the...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... way in which your question was asked.</p><p>I would say that at DHS, we enforce the law, and unfortunately, some parents chose to break the law and enter the country in a way that did not go to a port of entry.</p><p>We do have a tracking system.  We take very good care of the children that come into our care.</p><p>The part that I really worry about, is last year we had 70,000 children dropped off at the border by smugglers and traffickers whose parents decided to send them alone on an extraordinarily dangerous journey.  So we have about 13,000 of those who are in HHS care right now.</p><p>The tracking that we had, we used to ensure that families can be reunified if they do not have the ability to stay in the United States, so they can be reunited when they are removed.  HHS has a tracking system to ensure that they quickly, and as fast as possible, reunite children with families or with sponsors in the United States, which, as you know, is what TVPRA requires.</p><p>In terms of reuniting on the back end, most all of the children have been reunited with families.  The ones who have not, you know, we found about 80 percent of parents have now chosen for the third time that they do not want to be reunited with their children, and so those children remain in HHS care, and so HHS is trying to find safe sponsors for them and to give them good care.</p><p>When I talk to my partners in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, and I've called a couple ministerials over the past couple months -- they just came into town for a big conference -- we've really talked about, you know, how do we look at this regionally?</p><p>The goal of all of us should be to protect vulnerable populations, should be to have a system that enables us to keep families together, and should be able to ensure a safe and orderly process so that these vulnerable populations are helped as soon as possible.</p><p>The journey, as you know, is tremendously difficult and dangerous.  We have about 30 percent of women who take that journey sexually abused, 17 percent of men, 70 percent of the migrants are victims of violence.  So when I meet with UNHCR -- I met with the high commissioner again yesterday -- I've asked them for -- for -- since the whole time I've been secretary, \"Let's expand the asylum capacity throughout the regions so that we can help them as soon as possible on that journey, so that they're not forced to make decisions such as using a smuggler or using a trafficker, sending kids alone to the border.\"</p><p>So it's a work in progress.  I'm hopeful that the partnership will continue to grow.  We've had very pointed conversations on how to address that.</p><p>But you know, our -- our laws are difficult.  We do need to -- and we've asked Congress to change the law so that we can keep families who choose to come here, however they come here, whether it's illegally or legally -- that we can keep them together while we process their claim.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then we'll go back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  I'm David Grupo (ph).</p><p>And you had said in your comments that the decentralization of voting systems is actually strange (ph).  And you also said that you've seen the intent of a -- foreign attackers, nation attackers, and the attempt to attack and hack the systems around the country, right?  But that they haven't...</p><p>NIELSEN:  Of somebody.</p><p>QUESTION:  But that they haven't succeeded, right?</p><p>And so the question is, does that then mean that your position is that the Russian state doesn't have sufficient technical skills to hack into, say, the Louisiana voting system, or a parish of Louisiana?  Is that -- is that your -- is that what you're having us believe?</p><p>NIELSEN:  No.</p><p>Actually, what I said is that nation-states have demonstrated both the will and the capability to attempt to disrupt or deny our election infrastructure.  That's point number one.</p><p>So if I sit here today and I don't have any intel or any information from the state and locals that they are under some sort of scanning that we can attribute to foreign countries, what I'm actually saying is, don't let that mean anything other than what that means as a moment in time.  We know they have the will.  We know they have the capability.  We need to continue to be prepared and think about resilience and redundancy in the system.</p><p>SEIB:  Right there, and then here (ph).</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Madam Secretary, for spending time with us this morning.  I'm Mark Hannah with the Eurasia Group Foundation.</p><p>I appreciated what you said about 70 percent of the people coming up having been victims of violence.  Listening to the president's remarks last night, a reasonable person could infer that 70 percent were perpetrators of violence.</p><p>The wave of immigration coming north has been called an invasion.  A logical consequence of an invasion or a violent invasion would be an armed response.</p><p>Do you agree that it's an invasion that's coming north?  And when the president says we're going to treat people with rocks as though they had rifles, that caught many in the military off-guard.  What do you think that does to recruiting the new generation for military service when comments like that are made?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think on the first part, you know, to put it in perspective, we are apprehending about 1,500 to 2,000 illegal entrances a day.  So just to put it in perspective, that's a daily number.</p><p>The -- the challenge with the caravan is it's a very amorphous concept.  You don't get a ticket to the caravan.  There's not a membership program.  So what we're seeing are migrants who are potentially already on the flow, choose to be in the caravan, not choose to be in the caravan.  You've seen numbers reported by the press as high as 15,000.  I don't think the number is that high, based on our conversations with our partners in the region.</p><p>But I think what's difficult about this flow, or different about this flow, as you've seen talked about from everyone from President Hernandez through to Secretary Navarrete in Mexico, who's my counterpart -- one of my counterparts, is that that second and third flow are proving to be quite violent.  They are covering their faces.  They are, you know, attacking the -- the federal police.  They're attacking the military in Mexico.  They're putting the migrants who are in the caravan who are seeking asylum at risk.</p><p>So we're trying to work with the Mexicans to protect those who are legitimately seeking asylum to make sure that they have a way to do that as soon as possible.  As you know, Mexico has offered asylum to everybody traveling north right now.  We all, together, are encouraging migrants to take advantage of that for their own safety.</p><p>But we've also seen criminals in this flow.  We have seen gang members.  When I met with my counterparts in one of the countries in the region recently, they were very concerned because they had missing children.  There were kidnappings, under a false belief that if you had a child, you would be able to come into the United States and stay.NIELSEN:  So in general, mass migrations are dangerous for the migrants themselves.  It needs to be safe.  It needs to be orderly.  That's the best way that we can protect them.</p><p>And again, the system is broken when we're requiring somebody who's seeking asylum to travel seven weeks through very -- a very difficult process, usually at the hands of smugglers.</p><p>So, we're working with UNHCR, working with the region to try to make sure that we can help those populations much sooner.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here and then here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good morning.  Thanks for being here.  I'm Nili Gilbert from Matarin Capital.</p><p>I wonder how do you see the U.S. electorate and the major pressures on our country 30 or 40 years from now?  And if you had to build a long-term strategic plan for the Republican Party, how would it respond to those pressures?  And how is the party moving towards that today?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the one good news is that, despite the myriad of missions that we have at DHS, I do not have to do that one.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>So I would respectfully just refer you to the RNC.  We don't -- we -- national security is bipartisan.  Homeland Security is bipartisan.  I don't get into the politics of it.  We're just trying to secure the homeland.  So respectfully I wouldn't have any comment on that.</p><p>What I can tell you is, from a Homeland Security perspective, what I really worry about is how quickly the threats are morphing and that perhaps our defenses are lagging behind.  So part of what I feel very strongly is my responsibility is to make sure that DHS is resourced, that they have the tools they need and they have the authorities they need to combat these new threats.</p><p>So, for example, I'll give you a quick one, as you know, we just received authority to address the risk of nefarious unmanned aerial vehicles in the United States.  We see them real-time dropping drugs and other illicit materials across the border.  We see them surveilling sensitive locations.  We have seen them weaponized throughout theaters -- theaters of war as close as Mexico.  We've seen them armed with grenades.  But we did not have the authority until about two weeks ago to either monitor or identify or interdict a drone that had a nefarious purpose in the United States.</p><p>So I think we have to have a system that's much more flexible.  I encourage everyone at DHS to get on their toes, be really forward-thinking, double-down on the threats we know today, but really do that horizon-scanning and think about what is emerging so that we can make sure that we're prepared for it.</p><p>So that's my strategy in that sense.  We call it relentless resilience, mixed with partnership, to make sure that we can cover down on all the threats we have in the homeland.</p><p>SEIB:  Here, and then over here next.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Paula DiPerna, NTR Foundation.  Thank you for being here.</p><p>Back to issue of the military, regardless of the capacity issue and all the threats you've just described, it does feel like militarization of the Homeland Security -- militarization of our borders.  And so, at what point would the military, say, be authorized to shoot to kill on the border?  And who would authorize that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, the military -- of course, I would defer you to DOD for their rules of engagement.</p><p>But the military, of course, has always been allowed -- provided the opportunity to defend themselves, just as my Customs and Border Patrol agents and officers.</p><p>Our rules of engagement are published online.  We're very transparent about what we do at the border and how we engage.  I can't really speak more to DOD, but -- but our agents and officers are very clear.</p><p>I would say that assaults on our officers have gone -- continue to go up in some sectors.  We had over 800 instances last year where they were attacked by those coming across the border.  I do take their safety very seriously.  </p><p>But again our rules of engagement are transparent and clear and are posted online.</p><p>SEIB:  I think we're going there next, and then there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Madam Secretary, I thank you for being here.  I'm Neil Christian (ph) from Veritas Capital.</p><p>When the president started talking initially about a wall, I always thought it was a metaphor for increased border security.  And as time is going on, he actually seems to be talking about a real, concrete border wall on the southern border.</p><p>And I really appreciate all your eloquent responses today.  I'd really love to hear whether you believe that would -- if he's actually talking about a physical wall that will go up, and whether that's an effective way to protect the southern border.</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, I think what we need is a wall system.  So, we need some sort of infrastructure.  We need personnel and we need technology.  And we continue to look a whole variety of technological uses, including drones in a positive way, to make sure that we have situational awareness of that border.</p><p>What I would tell you is in some of the areas at our border -- and all the border areas are quite different, first of all -- I mean, some is in the middle of the desert, some near natural barriers such as rivers, but some abut directly onto cities on both sides.</p><p>There's a term we use for that which is called vanishing time.  The difficulty there is somebody can cross the border and disappear, either side, into an urban environment in a matter of minutes.</p><p>So the concept of impedance and denial becomes very important.  And the first and foremost way to do that is to have an infrastructure of some sort that slows them down, that gives us the opportunity to detect an illegal entry, but also hopefully it deters them from attempting it to begin with.  If they have a legitimate need to come, go to a port of entry.  And if they don't have a legitimate need to come -- this particularly we see a lot of unfortunate traffic that way of the smugglers, the traffickers and the transnational criminal organizations.</p><p>So, I think that there's a combination.  The president has been clear we don't need a wall from sea to shining sea, but there are some areas where that impedance and denial is the difference between being able to secure the border and not being able to secure the border.  But its only one part, and that's why I say we also need the personnel and technology, the sensors, the lights, the roads, the ability to apprehend, and the ability to have that situational awareness all across the border.</p><p>SEIB:  There, and then back there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Patricia Rosenfield, Rosenfield Fund.</p><p>I also want to thank you very much for this very clear and eloquent meeting.  But I wanted to ask about a more perhaps conceptual concern I have, and that is the pervasiveness of fear and lack of confidence in the democratic system that we know.  It certainly (ph) seems to be such an issue that might prevent voting as we've talked about.  But also fear (inaudible) the caravan, other issues that might require a stronger partnership with local community organizations and nonprofits, foundations, you seem to have a very effective system for intergovernmental coordination, even with local level actors internationally.</p><p>Just wondering how are you in department reaching out to the local -- to citizens?</p><p>You said that Homeland Security is not that well understood.  So I'm just wondering how are you doing that?  How are you working that?  How are you reaching out to the -- not the corporate but the nongovernmental nonprofit sector?  And how is that working?  And what could be done to make it stronger?NIELSEN:  Yes, so that is a great question.</p><p>You know, as I mentioned, everything we do at DHS we have to do in partnership because no one entity can address all these threats.</p><p>I'll give you an example on immigration.</p><p>So I have personally, as have my component heads, been in very close contact with many NGOs, with foundations.  We've asked them to be part of the conversation.  We've brought them into various conferences we've had within the Northern Triangle.  They play an extraordinarily important role, not just for taking care of the vulnerable populations as they travel, but also working with us in communities, both for receiving those who are coming here to claim asylum, as well as for those who are being repatriated back to the countries.</p><p>So the first ladies, particular of Guatemala, but Honduras as well, are very active.  I, with them, also have conversations with the NGO community.  We've asked the foundations to -- to step up.  We've asked them, you know, \"What -- what additional role are you willing to play?  How can you help us get additional resources to these populations?  How can you help us message to them about the right way to do things?\"  For example, in this particular instance, to help them understand what Mexico is offering, in terms of jobs and asylum, so that we can limit the violence on those populations.</p><p>So it's a very important role, and then I could, kind of, go through each mission set at DHS and the role they play.  But I think more and more, the communities -- you know, we say \"hometown security.\"  If we don't have hometown security, we don't have homeland security.</p><p>So again, immigration is an example.  I meet with the ranchers, I meet with the sheriffs, I meet with the landowners to try to understand what they're seeing.  What are their environments like?  What are they concerned about?  What can we do better, in partnership with them, to protect their constituents, as they do that every day as part of their main mission.</p><p>So I think that's crucial.  I don't know that we necessarily had leveraged that community as well as we needed to in the past.  So it's a very clear focus right now, particularly with respect to the human rights situation, and how we can really work with them and -- and learn from their expertise.</p><p>SEIB:  Can I just ask one quick follow-up?</p><p>NIELSEN:  Yeah.</p><p>SEIB:  You -- you've mentioned a couple of times your conversations with your Central American colleagues.  Are they doing enough, in your estimation, to actually reduce the flow -- the outflow of -- of migrants?</p><p>NIELSEN:  They are -- it's a capacity issue.  Nobody is really generally -- has the capacity for these numbers that we're talking about.  But they're working very hard.</p><p>We have -- we're in daily contact with all of the countries.  We roll up what they're doing.  They're trying a variety of different tactics and techniques in their communities to provide for those who would otherwise choose to leave.</p><p>We have been very interested in some of the U.N. data that has come out, for example, that says that many of the migrants that make their way into the United States do so because of lack of food.  And so we work with the countries to find out, \"Well, how can we address that more systemically?\"</p><p>And at the end of the day, it's about building prosperity and stability in the region.  So we've brought the private sector in.  I've spent a lot of time talking to American companies about how, and would they consider investing further in the area.  We've been working very closely with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to the same end.</p><p>But we -- we have to make it so that migration is -- is a choice; it's not believed by anyone to be a need.  So that's, you know, ensuring that they have opportunity and -- and what they need in the region.</p><p>SEIB:  Right here, and then probably this will be our last question there.</p><p>QUESTION:  My name's Phyllis Costanza, and I'm with UBS Optimus Foundation.</p><p>And I think a lot of resources for foundations, coming back to your point, are being spent on rehabilitation of children who are traumatized.  And what's important is this issue of prevention; not having to put resources into rehabilitating children.</p><p>So how are you working, specifically with organizations like USAID and other government entities, to prevent, in the first place, children from being traumatized?NIELSEN: Yeah, I mean, I think a -- a couple different ways.</p><p>The goal is -- as you know, with aid, is to do it in a targeted way with metrics so that we can then scale it and expand it if something works, or we can revise it and retarget it if it didn't produce the results that we wanted.</p><p>So the conversation to be had with USAID and the Alliance for Prosperity in general are very much about what's working, what's working from the local perspective, and how can we expand that.</p><p>We've seen some very interesting programs out of the Northern Triangle using USAID funding, for example, to have micro-competitions -- business competitions.  And if you win the competition, you will receive $12,000, which is the -- which is tied to and is that same amount in that area that you would pay a smuggler to come to the United States.</p><p>So we're trying to provide additional opportunity there as an alternative and to help them understand that they have another alternative.</p><p>But the -- the conversation needs to continue to evolve.  You know, what is the best way, what are the actual push factors in the region, and how can we -- again, it's stabilization, it's building prosperity, economic opportunity, continuing to help them reduce violence.</p><p>We've seen some very good news statistics on decreases in murder rates in particular parts of the Northern Triangle.  Everybody needs to do more to get those numbers down even lower.  So what can we do there to help build capacity, for example, for law enforcement to help ensure that there's a safe environment?</p><p>So it's an ongoing conversation, but I think what we're doing is learning from the foundations who are also there on the ground what is it that you're seeing and what works and what can we be doing to help the region?</p><p>SEIB:  So final question right there.  Wait a second.  There you go.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Daniel Holtzman, Bank of America.</p><p>In the 2019 budget, you asked for almost a billion dollars, or a 10 percent increase, 3,300 people, 52,000 beds.  Is -- what -- is -- what -- why do we still need the Army with increases like that?</p><p>NIELSEN:  So, as you might know, there's a difference between a request -- requesting an appropriation and having an appropriation.  We don't have an appropriation at DHS yet.  We're still in a continued resolution.  So we are hopeful that Congress will pass an appropriation in December.</p><p>The key to this issue at the end of the day is to be able to apprehend those who do not have a legal right, to detain them and then to very quickly process them.</p><p>And expeditious processing is important, because the system is so backlogged that when you have somebody who is within our country for many, many years, it complicates the ability for us to remove them.  They've likely now have roots in the community.  We don't always have the ability to know where they are if they fail to appear for a variety of engagements that are preplanned, predesignated notices to appear to courts, et cetera.</p><p>So the key is to apprehend those who do not have a legal right to stay, be able to detain them, to keep them in a process with the courts that is very expedited.</p><p>And again, I don't mean to get into too much detail.  This is extraordinarily complicated.  But the detained docket goes much more quickly than the non-detained docket.</p><p>So the fastest way to process through our system is to be detained, so the courts will very quickly hear your case adjudicated.  And then the court, of course, makes the decision to deport, not DHS.  The court will give us a final order of removal for a particular person and then we seek to remove them.</p><p>So it's a little bit of apples and oranges.  One is trying to address a potential massive flow that could be here in a number of days, and the other is a more systemic issue that we need to work with Congress on to address those pull factors.</p><p>Again, as I mentioned, we want to be able to keep families together.  We want to be able to treat non-Mexicans the same as we treat Mexicans.  There's different legal procedures for different nationalities right now that adds a lot of complexity to the system.  Many who arrive at our border don't have paperwork, so we want to make sure we do that.</p><p>And then with UACs, we want to -- sorry, unaccompanied children -- we want to make sure that we can take care of them as quickly as possible in the best way possible.  And there's some limits on how we can do that with that 13,000 that we have now.</p><p>So we've asked for some very specific fixes of Congress.  That's the legislative side.  We have the appropriations side.  Then we have the immediate potential surge right now that we're trying to make sure we're prepared for.</p><p>SEIB:  So, we've reached the 9 o'clock hour.  I will say you live in interesting times.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Thank you for coming in, sharing with us today.</p><p>NIELSEN:  My pleasure.  My pleasure.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>END </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-581770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TMT-FM41-JBSW-70M0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9330\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Federal News Service, Inc.

It is the final hour of trading on Wall Street as you can see here. Not a good start for the fourth quarter. Here are the reasons why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From Washington to Wall Street, the President is under pressure. New U.S. factory numbers are the worst in a decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's Mark Zuckerberg versus Elizabeth Warren. I'm sure you can't wait for this one. The Facebook founder says she is an existential threat to his company.</p><p>And UPS drones are cleared for takeoff. I'll speak to the CEO live on this program and of course, live from right here in the world's financial capital, New York City. It is Tuesday, October the 1st, I'm Paula Newton in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Okay, tonight, from Washington and now from Wall Street, the headaches mount for Donald Trump. Now, on the day the U.S. President launched a massive advertising spree for his reelection bid, he is now wrestling with a deepening Impeachment Inquiry, and now of course, those signs of cracks in his crowning achievement, right, the health of that all-important U.S. economy.</p><p>Now U.S. stocks are lower. As you can see, they're down better than one percent. They started that around lunchtime, haven't gotten any better. Investors are reacting to a bleak report on American manufacturing, a key indicator, show the sector shrinking faster than at any time since the end of the Great Recession. I don't have to remind you that's truly significant.</p><p>Mr. Trump says it's not his fault. He tweeted, as I predicted, \"Jay Paul and the Federal Reserve have allowed the dollar to get so strong, especially relative to all other currencies that are manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed rate too high. They are their own worst enemies. They don't have a clue. Pathetic.\"</p><p>Paul La Monica and Matt Egan are here from CNN Business. I know I don't want to end with pathetic and then go to you guys. You guys have been on top of this.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: You're very charitable.</p><p>NEWTON: But you guys have been on top of this all day long. Paul to you, what are the nuts and bolts of this? And why is this happening?</p><p>LA MONICA: I mean, I think you could argue that what's really pathetic, Paula is the fact that we're having a trade war with China. That is really the main reason why those manufacturing numbers were so bleak. You have such little confidence now from America's Heartland.</p><p>And I don't think many companies are out there saying, that Jay Powell, if only we had rated zero or maybe even negative, then the situation would be better.</p><p>The simple reality is we need a trade truce with China so that China starts buying our products again.</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: And to Paul's point, I looked in the ISM survey, no one mentioned borrowing costs, no one mentioned Fed policy. They didn't even talk about Jerome Powell's putting game, right. None of that was cited.</p><p>What was cited repeatedly was tariffs and the trade war, and that's because it's raising cost for businesses. It is raising cost for household. It's creating just so much uncertainty and all this havoc in the supply chain. So that's why we've seen these manufacturing numbers come down so significantly.</p><p>NEWTON: And Paul, I want to get to some other stocks in a moment that are also down for other reasons, but Matt before, I want to ask you about that monetary policy, because of course, there have been, you know, suspicions that monetary policy can't do much more.</p><p>When I talked to people who are doing business, they're like, we're getting a commercial loan at great rates. We don't need the interest rates lower.</p><p>Is there a fear now that, look, if fiscal policy doesn't do it, monetary policy can't help anymore. There's no loaded gun there.</p><p>EGAN: That's right. I mean, the impact of these rate cuts are much less because borrowing costs are already so historically low. It helps on the margin for housing, for autos, but lowering rates by a quarter point does nothing to reduce this uncertainty caused by the trade war and these tariffs, right? It doesn't help at all. What they really need is a trade agreement.</p><p>Now the risk, of course, is that they don't reach an agreement to either avert these next round of tariffs or roll back the existing tariffs before it's too late because if this manufacturing weakness spills over into consumers and the real economy, that's where you can get an actual recession.</p><p>LA MONICA: Lower rates are going to hurt bank profit margins, too, and anyone that's trying to save money, which I'd imagine there's a decent amount of Trump's constituency that are seniors who would love to have more money in their pocket. They're getting nothing on bank accounts or any other savings accounts because rates are so low already.</p><p>NEWTON: I know. I'm just going to hold you right there. When we're talking about trade, let's talk about trading. A component of this today was Charles Schwab making the move to basically have feeless trading. This is a real earthquake in this industry.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, this is a big move announced by Charles Schwab himself in the press release and Schwab stock is tumbling on it, so are rivals like TD Ameritrade and E-Trade.</p><p>Charles Schwab is following the lead of another smaller company called the Interactive Brokers that already has launched a similar product with no commissions. And then obviously, the elephant in the room is that Robin Hood and apps like that have really stolen the thunder of these big discount brokerages with free trading no commissions on apps that are extremely popular, particularly millennials who -- they're just happy. They don't care about stock picking, you give them an ETF. They're happy with that and not paying a fee. And that's good news.</p><p>[15:05:34]</p><p>EGAN: It is jarring to your point to see just how dramatically these stocks are down. The TD Ameritrade, I think it's on track for its worst day since 2006.</p><p>LA MONICA: A quarter of its value getting wiped out.</p><p>EGAN: Exactly. I think investors are saying that sort of like a trade war, right, there's no big winners here from these online broker wars, except of course the individual investor who has got to be happy right now.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, fear was never good. We've seen that with airlines historically.</p><p>NEWTON: I'm pretty happy about the no fee trading, though. Matt, Paul, thanks so much. Really appreciate it now.</p><p>Now, well, stocks on Wall Street fall, subpoenas are dropping all over Washington. Trump administration officials are today signaling that they might not be so quick to comply with Democratic demands.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted that Democrats are only trying to, in his words, intimidate and is refusing to honor requests for officials to testify under oath.</p><p>Environmental Protection Administrator, Andrew Wheeler meantime is also rallying around the President.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREW WHEELER, ADMINISTRATOR, U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ADMINISTRATION: I'm focused on the E.P.A. and what we're doing I'm sure that the President will be vindicated that. You know, they started this process before he actually was elected, and they've been trying to figure out a way of doing that from the very beginning, but I'm sure he will be vindicated as he has from all the other charges.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Now, the Impeachment Inquiry is looking at the U.S. President's attempts once again, a reminder attempts to pressure foreign leaders to make trouble for his political rivals, and his attempt of course to then try and cover it up.</p><p>Now at the top, of course, is Donald Trump, but these are all the President's Men: Rudy Giuliani is Donald Trump's personal lawyer. Two Ukrainians have told CNN that while in Kiev, Giuliani pushed them to investigate Joe Biden, the Democratic frontrunner in 2020.</p><p>Now in the last hour, we've learned that Giuliani has hired a former Watergate prosecutor to defend him.</p><p>Meantime, William Barr -- remember, he is the U.S. Attorney General. At the President's request, he has reportedly been traveling around the world probing the origins of the Russian investigation. Mr. Trump has so far press the Ukrainian President and the Australian Prime Minister to try and help them out with that.</p><p>Meantime, Mike Pompeo as we were just discussing. He is the U.S. Secretary of State. A source tells CNN, he was in fact on the call with Ukraine's President when Mr. Trump asked for a favor. Now, Giuliani has said that Pompeo's State Department helped him set up those meetings in Ukraine.</p><p>Meantime, we have of course, Mike Pence, he is the Vice President. When he met with the Ukrainian President last month, Pence says they talked about U.S. aid to Ukraine.</p><p>And finally, of course, can't forget Lindsey Graham, right? A Republican senator and the President's most staunch supporter, really in the press. He has been on cable news trying to discredit the whistleblower who brought all of this to light in the first place.</p><p>Now, our Sarah Westwood has been following all of these developments at the White House. I mean, Sarah, are a lot to keep track of here. But when we look at, as we've been saying, the President's Men, this is really the makings of a strategy. Right? I mean, Mike Pompeo couldn't be clearer. I will fight this inquiry tooth and nail.</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: That's right. A defiant response today from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo facing that congressional subpoena from three different congressional committees the deadline of which is Friday.</p><p>So he only have three days if he were to comply on the timeline that House Democrats want. But he raised several objections to that, one of them being the fact that House Democrats don't want witnesses to be accompanied necessarily by State Department lawyers or White House lawyers. They want to have candid testimony from the five current and former officials that House Democrats want to depose.</p><p>But more broadly, this just fits a pattern that the White House has engaged in since House Democrats have really begun scrutinizing the actions of this administration over the past year.</p><p>They've stonewalled. They've tried to drag this process out as much as possible. It's a very complicated web of everything going on, but is at the center of this Impeachment Inquiry. But essentially what you have are all of the people that you listed: Rudy Giuliani, Attorney General Bill Barr, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo using positions of power to pursue the President's political interests. That's what they are being accused of. It's at the heart of this Impeachment Inquiry.</p><p>House Democrats have said, if Pompeo does not comply with their subpoena, they will consider that obstruction under the Impeachment Inquiry. So that is, of course the risk that this White House runs if they continue this stonewalling strategy, that they could contribute to something that could go in eventual Articles of Impeachment were those to be brought -- Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: And again, this obviously could ensnare a lot of different courts in terms of if it becomes a legal battle. But whether or not this will become a campaign battle, we already know for sure that it will be, one way or the other.</p><p>[15:10:10]</p><p>NEWTON: Is there any sense of how the White House, those around him or his campaign are planning to fight this in terms of the President?</p><p>WESTWOOD: Well, Paula, CNN has reported that those around the President don't believe that Trump is necessarily taking it seriously enough that he necessarily recognizes the peril that he is in politically with this Impeachment Inquiry.</p><p>Sources tell CNN that he has been warned by his aides and advisers that at this point, impeachment is not just possible, but likely and that he should prepare for it. But also the White House doesn't seem to have an overarching strategy to defend the President against impeachment.</p><p>There's not plans at this moment to bring in additional lawyers. The President has dismissed suggestions that he should hire an impeachment response team. He is expected to be briefed this week on an impeachment strategy from his aides.</p><p>But so far, Paula, we've not seen much in the way of an overarching strategy that's left a lot of the President's allies to sort of fend for themselves, and a lot of that's why we've seen a lot of different defenses from Trump and those around him.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. And if you wonder if the President doesn't believe that in the end is the best strategy at this point. Sarah Westwood live from the White House. Appreciate it.</p><p>Now, of course, we have been talking about Ukraine, right, and the fact that it is at the center of all of this.</p><p>CNN's Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward is in Kiev and was able to speak to the Ukrainian President just a little while ago. Volodymyr Zelensky told her he can't be pressured.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Did you feel pressure from President Trump to investigate the Biden's in order to unfreeze military?</p><p>VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): I understood. I'd like to tell you that I never feel pressure. I have lots of people who would like to put pressure on me here and abroad. But I'm the President of an independent Ukraine. And I'd like to think and my actions suggest no one can put pressure on me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Clarissa Ward now joins us live from Kiev. Clarissa, thanks for being with us. I know you had a chance to speak to him directly. You know, what he is saying is very easy to say, of course, but very difficult to prove.</p><p>In your time there on the ground, how have you been able to ascertain exactly what's at the heart of this. And you know, how rattled is this new President? We have to point out, he is a novice.</p><p>WARD: Well, I think Paula, he is definitely very uncomfortable with the situation. I mean, he's barely been inaugurated and he is already inheriting this sort of excruciating for Ukraine political maelstrom.</p><p>He is clearly being very, very careful in how he articulates his position and Ukraine's position on this, even in his answer to me, he says, no one can put pressure on me.</p><p>He doesn't say no one put any pressure on me, which will be much more declarative and much more definitive in terms of answering the question as to whether Trump and his various surrogates were indeed putting pressure on President Zelensky.</p><p>But in all of this, he's in a tough position, right, because Ukraine is very much reliant on the larges of the U.S., $400 million in military aid alone this year, Paula, and so they can't be seen to be picking sides, Democrat or Republican. They don't know who's going to win the next election in 2020. And so they need to be at least on the surface impartial.</p><p>And they're desperately hoping that this whole thing will blow over, but as you and I both know, and most of our viewers by now, that's not looking very likely -- Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: No. And they might have to be much more strategic the way they play this. The question I have for you, is this. Everybody is always looking for the proverbial smoking gun when it comes to any one of these inquiries. Is it to be found in Ukraine?</p><p>WARD: Well, this is another interesting question because once you really start to pull on the threads here of all the different various investigations that will need to be carried out to try to get to the bottom of this, you realize that there are many different countries connected in different ways with allegations of money laundering, allegations of impropriety, allegations of embezzlement.</p><p>And whoever it is who becomes responsible for really trying to get to the bottom of all of this web is going to have a tough time on their hands because it is very difficult to get information here. Not a lot of clarity and transparency, and obviously all of it so charged because of the very tense political situation in the U.S. -- Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: And there in a nutshell is what the Democratic committees are up against on Capitol Hill and elsewhere. Clarissa Ward, thanks so much. Really appreciate you being in Kiev for us.</p><p>Now one party, two systems. Lots of problems as China's Communist State celebrates its 70th birthday, violence breaks out across Hong Kong.</p><p>And cleared for takeoff, UPS gets the first of its kind approval to build a drone airline. The CEO tells me where they're flying next.</p><p>[15:17:35]</p><p>NEWTON: Violent protests rocked Hong Kong after a day of celebration in Beijing marking the 70th Anniversary of the People's Republic of China.</p><p>Now, fires were set, teargas was fired and a teenager was shot and injured by a police officer with a live ammunition and that is significant. The officer fired after the team swung a metal rod at his arm. It is thought to be the first time live bullets have been used by police against demonstrators.</p><p>Now, CNN reporters saw chaotic scenes unfolding through the night. Our Anna Coren was in the middle of it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We were sitting on the ground when the police fired teargas at everybody else who was standing here and sitting here as well. It was just preposterous.</p><p>Firing again. Firing again. Firing again over at the media. I mean, they are firing teargas at the media.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Jamie Metzl is Senior Fellow at the Atlantic Council and he joins me now, and of course a disturbing scene. Again, more escalation in Hong Kong. I want to get first to the celebration, and you pointed out and others have pointed out that this celebration went on in the middle of Tiananmen Square. We are at 30 years after that massacre.</p><p>The President, President Trump congratulated President Xi, some Republicans took a different tone and said clearly that, you know, they're thinking about the victims of this communist regime.</p><p>When it's taken all in sum, what can be said about the last 70 years and significantly how China chose to mark it today having that big military parade?</p><p>JAMIE METZL, SENIOR FELLOW, ATLANTIC COUNCIL: So when you tell the story of China over the last 70 years, there's certainly a good story to be told; 850 million people have been brought up from abject poverty. China has become a wealthy, powerful country and has actually done a lot not just to develop China, but to help other parts of the world develop and that's great and it should be recognized.</p><p>But we also need to recognize that this regime is responsible for unbelievable brutality, the death or murder of 45 million Chinese people. They have these 250,000 troops marching in Tiananmen Square, they should have 45 million dead souls marching behind them because that's the history of the Chinese Communist Party. The people who were massacred in Tiananmen Square.</p><p>And there's certainly a role for China and the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party even to play in this world. But if they are not coming clean about their history, if they are a force of doing harm, not just to the Chinese people, but undermining rule of law and international order, then I think we need to be honest that this isn't just a day of celebration, we need to balance things that deserve to be celebrated and things that deserve to be roundly condemned.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet you, as being involved in the Obama administration, certainly President Obama even sending his family over there for a term offensive as it were, kind of thought, look, it is better to engage with them on a different level. It didn't work, Jamie, why not?</p><p>METZL: So we have to engage with China. China is too big and too important. There are some people who think the United States can just completely decoupled from China. We can't decouple from them. And they can't decouple from us. That's their history. And that's our history.</p><p>Certainly, the Obama administration -- I was in the Clinton administration, the Obama administration was absolutely wrong, to say that what China wanted was just more respect, because when the Obama -- at the beginning of the Obama administration, when they said, oh, we are just going to hug China, the Chinese saw that as weakness.</p><p>China has a different view of the world than the United States has had. The world exists on the foundation of the world that our parents and grandparents built from the ashes of the Second World War and that has provided peace, security and stability for a big chunk of the world population.</p><p>China has a different vision of the future and good on them for fighting for the kind of world that at least the Communist Party wants. But that's not the kind of world that we want to live in.</p><p>So rather than celebrating the Chinese Communist Party, President Trump should say, here are our standards. Here's what we, the United States and our allies and friends think the world ought to look like, and we welcome you, China to join us in that endeavor.</p><p>NEWTON: And that brings us squarely to Hong Kong. President Xi in fact said we will maintain the one country two systems. How optimistic are you given the escalation that we've seen and really know an insight to these protests.</p><p>METZL: Yes, it's meaningless for President Xi to say that one country two systems still stands when the Chinese Communist Party is destroying the foundations of that. They're destroying the rule of law. They're destroying human rights.</p><p>There's just no way that any one can say that one country two systems is still viable, and that's what the protesters in Hong Kong are standing up for. They know what happens if you are a minority group in China, because they've seen the Tibetans, they've seen the Uyghurs, they've seen the decimation of even the people of Inner Mongolia, who aren't even talked about and that's what's going to happen to Hong Kong.</p><p>And they have this window, who knows how long it is, when they can stand up for their rights and that's what they're doing.</p><p>NEWTON: An extraordinary the ages of those protesters that you see in the street, many of them just 17, 18, 19 years old. Jamie, thanks so much again for coming on the show. I am sure we will to talk about it.</p><p>Now on to UPS, which has now approval to build a drone airline. Flight Forward, a division of the delivery giant now has official certification to fly as many drones as it wants, including -- get this -- at night. And with cargo over 25 kilograms, about 55 pounds. And it's the first full certification in the U.S.</p><p>UPS is already flying drones at a hospital campus in North Carolina, and does in fact, of course plan to expand.</p><p>David Abney is the CEO of UPS. He joins me now from Atlanta, and thanks for being with us. We've heard a lot of promises about the potential of drones. Will this be transformative for UPS and the sector and if so, when? Like next week?</p><p>DAVID ABNEY, CEO, UPS: Paula, this is transformative not only for UPS, but for customers. And you do hear a lot of noise, but I'm telling you that this is the first certification by the F.A.A. under Part 135. So it's full certification, which means multiple drones, multiple locations, multiple customers, multiple operators, so we can operate anywhere in the nation that drones are authorized to operate. So this is good news.</p><p>And it's initially good news for our healthcare customers, because we're going to be able to make very urgent shipments and be able to move specimens and vaccines in a very quick manner. So we're real excited about this.</p><p>NEWTON: Absolutely. And how long do you think it will be before this is actually rolled out in a more expansive way?</p><p>ABNEY: We are immediately starting. As soon as we got authorization, we flew our first Beyond Line of Sight Flight last Friday, and that is just the beginning and we are already flying in the WakeMed Medical Center that you've referred to. We will see dozens of similar healthcare campus sites and they will build on top each other.</p><p>[15:25:02]</p><p>ABNEY: So it's one thing to be the first to get the certification. We're also going to be first to scale and scale out a meaningful way.</p><p>NEWTON: Interesting. So I should look to the sky very soon for that package?</p><p>ABNEY: That is absolutely right. And we will be there and you did point out correctly that this is not just five pounds or less. This can go up to over 55 pounds, and a little secret, these drones do not sleep, so we can deliver at all times of the day and night.</p><p>So it just offers our customers a wide variety of services that they wouldn't have had.</p><p>NEWTON: And as I said, going on with an industry that continues to transform and has to transform, I mean, FedEx, one of your rivals, it has lowered guidance. Is that a possibility for UPS? We've just been discussing on the show, of course, the slower growth, the terrible manufacturing data today in the United States, how concerned are you?</p><p>ABNEY: We are just completing our quarter and our earnings call will be in a few weeks. Obviously, I can't talk about the recent quarter. I can tell you that the U.S. economy has held up strong from a domestic standpoint, it is driven by the consumer and we're happy with that end of it.</p><p>And yes, there are headwinds, but there's also tailwinds. And what's important for us is to focus on what we can control, and how we can provide value to our customers, how we can control our costs. And that has been and will continue to be our focus, which is execution.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet there are a lot of problems even underlying global growth at this point in time and that's whether it's Asia or Europe. I mean, how important do you think it is, just in general for the health of the U.S. economy and other economies to actually get some of the trade irritants out of the way?</p><p>ABNEY: Well, we would like to see a trade agreement between China and the U.S. that addresses the concerns, but also allows each country to build on a win-win relationship.</p><p>And obviously, we would like to see Brexit get settled and give businesses continuity and where they know what to expect that is coming up. Again, though, sometimes what's considered challenges can also be opportunities. And with this trade follows change, it creates opportunities for us to fire our planes in different trade lanes and different locations. So we're going to focus on the opportunities and what we can do for our customers.</p><p>NEWTON: Well, in a few weeks, we'll wait for the results of that third quarter and of course, you're all important forward guidance. Thanks so much for being with us today. Appreciate it.</p><p>ABNEY: All right, thank you, Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: Now, while Democrats spar with Donald Trump on Capitol Hill, the President is taking his message straight to the people with an advertising blitz on Facebook.</p><p>[15:30:00]</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, HOST, QUEST MEANS BUSINESS: Hello, I'm Paula Newton, and there's more QUEST MEANS BUSINESS in a moment. When Twitter faced calls to suspend Donald Trump as he ramps up online ads against impeachment.</p><p>And the CEO of Blackstone Steven Schwarzman tells us why buying a company is a lot like shooting a basketball. Before that though, the headlines at this hour. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says no one could pressure him to investigate Joe Biden or his son, Hunter.</p><p>He was responding to reporter's question about that controversial July call in which President Trump urged Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. The Ukrainian president insists he is the leader of an independent Ukraine.</p><p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is pushing back on a request from House Democrats to depose State Department officials in the Ukrainian inquiry as early as this week. Pompeo says that's, quote, \"not feasible\" and is accusing Democrats of trying to intimidate and bully his staff.</p><p>Police have a suspect in custody after a stabbing left one person dead and nine injured at a school in eastern Finland. Report say the man attacked students and staff with a sword. Police would only say he used a bladed weapon. The suspect, a Finnish native was wounded in the altercation with police.</p><p>Prince Harry and his wife Meghan are suing a British tabloid over a private letter it published. The royals allege it was not only published illegally, but that it was also edited selectively to hide, quote \"lies\". The paper had told about the Duchess so far, there's no response from that tabloid.</p><p>OK, people are weighing in on this impeachment inquiry. Fresh CNN polling shows that public support for removing Donald Trump from the White House is in fact rising. About half, 45 -- 47 percent pardon me, support impeaching the president, that's up from 41 percent who felt that way in May. Now, it matches the high point for impeachment in this poll.</p><p>The same number said he should be impeached -- he should have been impeached back in September 2018. Now, the survey shows rising support for impeachment not from Democrats, but this is significant, among independents and Republicans. Now, the share of independents who want impeachment is up 11 points, and 14 percent of those who describe themselves as Republicans now believe he should be impeached.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has kicked up a massive campaign on Facebook, running ads, pushing back against impeachment. Donie O'Sullivan is here, you've been taking a look at this along with looking at some research that's being done. You know, my question to this is why not go to Facebook? It certainly has worked with him before from that digital campaign for 2016. But who is he speaking to? Is he just speaking to his base?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: It's a combination of both, Paula. So, which Facebook ads you can target the folks who already follow you and like you. But you can also sort of push your content, push your posts in front of people who don't follow you. So, a lot of Trump supporters, a lot of people who do not follow Trump are seeing these ads.</p><p>One expert I spoke to from NYU university here in New York said yesterday that a lot of what the Trump campaign is doing with these anti-impeachment ads is sort of a way of actually taking the temperature of their current supporters as well.</p><p>So, they're asking them to sign up to new initiatives, he's calling the anti-impeachment defense force. So, it's a good way to also see as well as sort of recruiting new people in, new supporters, to see what is the level of support and passion about a particular topic among your supporter base.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and it's interesting because the president does have a lot of leverage on that platform. And now the Democrats have a problem though with some of those things that Facebook has been doing or not doing, shall we say in the last few months.</p><p>[15:35:00]</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, I mean, President Trump and the Trump campaign are masters of social media. There's no campaign, no Democratic candidate that can handle social media --</p><p>NEWTON: Wow --</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Quite the way that the Trump campaign has. As we said last week alone, they ran 1,800 ads on Facebook, spent up to $2 million on anti- impeachment ads. Now, we all remember back in 2016, the big problems Facebook had with misinformation. Facebook has since hired independent fact-checkers to when there's something that is false on the platform, it gets marked as false.</p><p>Facebook doesn't remove it, but it does down-rank it, so it's seen by less people. That accounts for news articles, that accounts for posts, blog posts, but it does not count for politicians. So, Nick Clegg; the former deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom who now works for Facebook confirmed in a speech last week, saying that we're not going to fact-check what candidates say because we don't think we should have that power essentially.</p><p>The DNC came out with a statement today to CNN, really taking issue with Facebook's policy here. They say Trump does not have a good reputation with the truth, and if you're going to allow him to spend millions of dollars, the Trump campaign has spent $20 million on Facebook ads since May of 2018, you've got to fact-check them. You can't be paid to spread lies.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that would certainly be a battle that will continue through this 2020 campaign. I want you to listen now, Donie, to Kamala Harris telling Anderson Cooper about what she thinks should be done with Donald Trump on another social media platform. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And his Twitter account should be suspended. I think there's plenty of now, evidence to suggest that he is irresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people. And so, the privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Donie, will that ever happen?</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: No, I mean, I think this is a question -- the same with what the DNC is asking Facebook to do. The DNC is asking Facebook to fact-check politicians' posts and to make a decision whether those posts should be allowed to stay up on the platform or not. Same with Harris, she is saying, you guys should shut down the account of the president of the United States.</p><p>We have heard the past two years -- at the same time, I mean, there are Democrats who say these companies are too powerful and need to be broken up. So, we're always hearing how there's too much power in Silicon Valley. Yet, what Democrats are doing is trying to even give them more power, and that is what companies like Facebook and Twitter are saying to push back.</p><p>They're saying we don't believe we should be responsible for making these decisions. Now, some people might say that's a cop-out, but others will say, you know, these -- this is the modern public square. They are private companies, they can do whatever they want with their platforms, but they're essentially the new town's square.</p><p>And if we're, you know, pushing out the voices of the president of the United States from that, that could be a problem.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and apparently, according to Nick Clegg, they're also, you know, you're entitled to your own facts as well as far as he's concerned. Just my little -- here on that. Donie, thanks for coming because we're going to continue to discuss this, it will be very important with these platforms going forward in 2020, appreciate it.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg criticizes presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in leaked audio from an internal meeting. The Facebook CEO vows to go to the mat and fight if his company is threatened.</p><p>[15:40:00]</p><p>NEWTON: Facebook's CEO Mark Zuckerberg is prepared to sue the federal government if a future Democratic president tries to break up his company. Now, according to leaked audio posted by \"The Verge\". Zuckerberg admitted to employees that an Elizabeth Warren presidency would in his words, suck.</p><p>Remember, those are his words, not mine for his company. Senator Warren tweeted a response, slamming the company for fumbling its responsibility to protect the U.S. democracy. And she also quoted the word \"suck\" again as you can see there. God, I hate that word, Casey Newton is Silicon Valley editor at \"The Verge\", no relation. He broke this story and joins me now.</p><p>Good on you for actually getting this audio so that we can hear him in his own words which is important. And yet, what was your take-away from all of it?</p><p>CASEY NEWTON, SILICON VALLEY EDITOR, THE VERGE: Well, you know, as noteworthy as Mark Zuckerberg's comments are in this piece, I was really struck by the questions that the employees were asking. If you sort of watch, you know, employee after employee going up to the microphone with a question.</p><p>What you really take away from it is the deep unease that is being felt across the company right now as they face federal investigation, potential break-ups, competition, a declining reputation and more. So, I was just really struck at how much that seems to have sunken in with rank-and-file Facebook employees.</p><p>NEWTON: It's interesting in terms of the concern filtering out to Facebook. When you look at that battle between Elizabeth Warren and Facebook, are you surprised really about how either side is holding to their corners right now?</p><p>NEWTON: I'd say they're both behaving about as you would expect, right? Senator Warren has presented a pretty bold plan to break up big tech, right? It could require Facebook to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp for example. And you can imagine why Mark Zuckerberg is going to do everything in his power to prevent that from happening.</p><p>So, I think that all things considered, Zuckerberg was pretty diplomatic in his response. But he's also signaling that Facebook is not going to roll over and let a Warren administration do whatever it wants to Facebook.</p><p>NEWTON: And yet, going forward, what can Facebook do in this environment over the next year? You know, the spotlight is on them and will be, especially through the next 14 months as we lead up to that 2020 campaign. It seems to me and even being off the cuff. And I know it's a town hall, he wants to be honest.</p><p>But then he didn't do himself any favors in that bracket if he was trying to moderate Elizabeth Warren's position or any other Democrat.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, I think that that's a fair point to make. I think that, you know, what Facebook can do is to try a number of different things to build trust. We saw Zuckerberg go to D.C. recently to meet with lawmakers to try to make the case to them in person that Facebook is better off when it's all together and not broken up.</p><p>And I think you're going to see them do a lot to promote the work they're doing around, protecting the platform from election interference in 2020, for example. But you know, at the end of the day, it's a large platform, it has proven very hard to control, and that's one reason why Senator Warren and others are so intent on breaking it up.</p><p>NEWTON: If we try and really look at the tea leaves or where regulation comes in, OK, it may not be as drastic as what Elizabeth Warren is doing. But you know, \"The New York Times\" had a great investigation this week on - - you know, unfortunately, the fact that, you know, a pedophilia is also on Facebook and now an encrypted Facebook Messenger as well.</p><p>At what point do they say to themselves, look, no one wants this, it doesn't matter if you're Elizabeth Warren or Facebook. How do we get to that regulatory solution that is going to make everyone happy?</p><p>NEWTON: Oh, well, I think that probably, we're not going to get to a point where everyone is happy. But I think there's probably a good happy medium in there somewhere, right? A world in which Facebook is truly accountable for some of the bad things that happen as a result of the platform that it has built. I think we can get there.</p><p>And I think we can get there by the way in a way that still leaves Facebook a big and profitable and successful company. So, I think there's a middle path there. The details are heavy technical.</p><p>[15:45:00]</p><p>Sometimes, you know, Congress bungles those technical details and we wind up with bad law. So, it's going to be very tricky to sort this all out, but you know, I'm an optimist, I think we can find some sort of solution.</p><p>NEWTON: Well, and apparently, Europe will find it for everyone if they don't get to it soon enough. Casey, thanks so much, really appreciate you bringing this story to us.</p><p>NEWTON: My pleasure.</p><p>NEWTON: Now, he is one of the biggest names on Wall Street. Next, the CEO of Blackstone Steven Schwarzman tells us his rules for investing on what is -- as you can see there, still a very miserable day for the market.</p><p>NEWTON: The CEO of Blackstone says he sees himself as more of an entrepreneur than an executive. Steven Schwarzman has more than a half trillion dollars of assets under management, and now, he's hoping to share his success. His new book is called \"What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence\".</p><p>He told Richard why buying and selling companies is a lot different from trading stocks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVEN SCHWARZMAN, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BLACKSTONE: You don't buy anything unless you can accelerate the growth and have a special plan. And this is not like buying a stock. Buying a stock, you buy a stock, it goes up, it goes down. Before we buy anything, we get what's called technically due diligence.</p><p>We get the opportunity to look at the entire company and all of its information. And we formalize a plan and then we buy it.</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN: Do you still get a frisson of excitement when you see a company that you can perhaps -- other people are a bit down on? But you think you can do -- does the stomach and the butterflies start going again?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, what happens is then you know you have a winner because you --</p><p>QUEST: But you still get excited?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, it's sort of like playing basketball, and somebody throws you a ball and you're open for a shot. And it's right when you let the ball go, you can tell the arc and you know it's going to go in. How does that make you feel? It makes you feel good.</p><p>QUEST: You say you can learn to be a leader, but you can't learn to be an entrepreneur. You can learn to be an executive.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: That's right.</p><p>QUEST: Which are you?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: I'm more an entrepreneur, but I've learned I had to be manager and an executive. So, for me, that was learning experience.</p><p>[15:50:00]</p><p>The intuitive part of starting things, seeing opportunity, getting people excited, knowing where to go, I've done that since I was really sort of a kid.</p><p>QUEST: You, how you did -- I mean, you wanted your father to expand his successful linens store into some chain to rival Sears.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Yes, well, I --</p><p>QUEST: And he told you in no uncertain terms.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Yes, well, he wasn't that authoritative. He's very polite and he said Steve, I don't want to do that. And I said dad, why don't you want to do it? I -- you know, I think we could be really successful. He said, I just don't want to do it.</p><p>So, I started limiting my ambitions from going nationwide to going all over Pennsylvania which is where we were from, and he didn't want to do that, and I thought maybe he could expand over Philadelphia, he didn't want to do that. So, I finally said dad, why don't you want to do this? It's going to work. And he said, I'm happy. I'm happy at the size we are.</p><p>I have enough money to own a house, to have two cars and to send you and your brothers to college. He said I don't want any more.</p><p>QUEST: Is that the lesson you've taken from your upbringing? To be happy is -- has a value.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, yes, I'm quite happy, but I still like expanding things like that. So, you can be a combination of happy, but also liking challenges.</p><p>QUEST: We do a lot of work on this program looking at CEOs as the moral compass --</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Yes --</p><p>QUEST: These days.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: In the absence of leadership elsewhere, which I think we could probably --</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: Agree there is, CEOs are having to take up the slack. Now, whether it's bathrooms and there's gender bathrooms in the Carolinas --</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: Whether it's new laws in Texas, whether -- whatever it might be.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Right --</p><p>QUEST: CEOs, the climate issue, you can see the way governments pulled back. Is the CEO equipped to be the moral compass?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, that wasn't the historical job --</p><p>QUEST: Exactly --</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Of the CEO. In the world we're living in, which is where everything is inter-related, it's pretty clear that you have to think about these types of things. And you start out, you know, like a doctor, the credo is, do no harm. You know, you're not in the business of inflicting harm on constituencies. And that, if you can, help these constituencies, that's a good thing.</p><p>QUEST: But you see it as part of your role as CEO. It's to get your hands dirty in LGBT issues, in choice issues and all the things that will come up from your employees?</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, that would be, Richard, like being a senator. You know, where you deal with every issue. I think as the CEO, you have to have a thoughtful point of view on every issue. Whether you can act on every issue would be very unusual because you have another job as well.</p><p>So, I think, you know, for example, I was at, you know, a business roundtable event, I think it was like 2014 or 2013. And Mrs. Obama came and talked about military veterans in the United States. And that about 20 of them a day were committing suicide, not in combat, but when they got back.</p><p>And I sat there and I couldn't believe that 20 people a day who survived combat killed themselves because of high unemployment and other factors. And she was asking for people to volunteer to hire veterans. So, you know, I got back on the plane, I got to New York and I usually have group decision-making at the firm, and I was just in a car outside my apartment, and I said you know what?</p><p>We're going to hire 50,000 veterans. And I just dictated a note to her. And not only have we hired 50,000, that was a five-year commitment. We did it in four, and we committed for another 50,000. Now, why did we do that? Because it was the moral thing to do. And so, one of the things about being the CEO is you can't express yourself on every issue.</p><p>But you know, periodically, there are issues that you think are really important and you prioritize them. And it's almost like teaching your own people values. I think that's important.</p><p>QUEST: On that final note, I'm going to ask you to choose one of your 25 rules for work and life.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Now, there's 25 of them, and which one would you choose?</p><p>[15:55:00]</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Well, I would probably choose --</p><p>QUEST: You could have a refresher if you need.</p><p>SCHWARZMAN: Yes, well, there are a lot of them. But you know, I think one of the things -- and you know, it's more particular to me, but I think it works for everybody, is if you're going to pick something to do in life, it should be worthy, it should be pretty grand in concept, it should be something that's pretty unique.</p><p>Something that excites you to the point that you're willing to dedicate, you know, your life to making that vision, which I call a worthy fantasy, come true. And you don't have to be the head of a company. You could be somebody who is working with a nonprofit, a for-profit in your area.</p><p>You can have your own small business, you can have a medium-sized business. It's something where you say I think I can create something that's unusual. Something that appeals to me sufficiently, I can be excited about this every day. And it will find its way, it will change society. I think that's a great way to conceptualize what you do well with your time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWTON: Steven Schwarzman there speaking to Richard Quest. There are just moments left to trade on Wall Street, it's not being a good day, we will sum up the numbers for you right after this.</p><p>NEWTON: OK, we want to tell you about something you don't want to miss on Wednesday, she is one of the most powerful women in the world, how Christine Lagarde is about to take over her most important role yet. Richard Quest sits down with Christine Lagarde as she prepares to take over as president of the European Central Bank.</p><p>You can see that she's going to be in the crosshairs, you can see that full interview on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tomorrow night 8:00 p.m. London time, 9:00 p.m. in Berlin, and Richard, yes, will be back. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS for today, as we're saying it was a bit of a tough day on the markets as you can see there.</p><p>We are basically at session lows or close to on all three indices. Again, the markets reacting mainly to some pretty poor manufacturing data out of the United States, the lowest read in about a decade, and of course we still have those concerns to do with the U.S.-China trade deal. Although, a reminder that they are getting back to talks next week and people are still hoping for some kind of an outcome. And that brings us to Jake Tapper and \"THE LEAD\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019100101cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5W-NP91-DXH2-62H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 1, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

By night, he indulges his other passion: predicting Apple Inc.'s results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leitao is part of a cadre of amateur forecasters, bloggers and hobbyists who sift through reams of data every quarter to guess at Apple's quarterly results - often putting professional analysts to shame by coming up with more accurate predictions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Co-founder of the Apple Independent Analysts Group, Leitao is ranked seventh for the December quarter out of 50 analysts who cover Apple by Fortune magazine, which found that his estimates turned out to be much closer to the results than those from prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachsand Morgan Stanley.</p><p>While Wall Street analysts' forecasts for Apple's revenue and earnings per share were off by an average of 21 per cent in the latest quarter, amateur analysts missed by just 10 per cent, according to the Fortune data.</p><p>This raises questions about how good Wall Street is at forecasting Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, famous for trouncing market forecasts quarter after quarter.</p><p>Leitao does not believe he and the more than 100 members of the Apple Independent Analysts Group - which he started as a hobby - are smarter than their professional peers. He suspects Wall Street is more inclined to play it safe.</p><p>It does not help that Apple itself tends to lowball its guidance. \"In their work, there is a greater risk in coming out with aggressive estimates that are too high,\" Leitao said of analysts at top-tier brokerage firms.</p><p>In the last couple of years, Apple's earnings have exceeded Wall Street expectations tracked by Thomson Reuters by at least 13 per cent, and often a lot more. The exception was the September quarter of 2011, when they fell short.</p><p>Technology analysts say Apple is particularly tough to predict because of its secretive nature, and because it has a hand in everything from hard-ware (iPhones, iPads, Macs and iPods) to digital distribution (iTunes and its emerging iCloud remote storage service).</p><p>They also point to a lack of historical data on the tablet market, and Apple's fast expansion into more than 100 countries as challenges. Yet another blind spot is sales from Apple's own retail stores and apple.com - data that only the company has.</p><p>\"If you're talking about Apple where you're trying to model Macs and phones and new markets like tablets, that's obviously more challenging than making assumptions around Intelwhere you're only modelling PCs,\" said JMP analyst Alex Gauna.</p><p>Analysts refine their financial models by studying Asian companies that supply components to Apple, surveying retail executives, and extrapolating from sales of previous generations of iPhones and iPads.</p><p>Their counterparts covering Intel Corp.and other big tech companies regularly visit PC manufacturers in Asia to take the industry's temperature. But attempts to talk to Apple's more than 100 suppliers, including Foxconn or Hon Hai Precision Indus-try Co. Ltd., often run into a wall of silence.</p><p>Beyond normal U.S. Regulation Fair Disclosure rules governing the disclosure of material information, companies working for Apple are required to sign strict confidentiality agreements and risk losing Apple's business if they break them. That rigour stems from the era of Steve Jobs, who kept an iron grip on his team and refused to release products until they were perfected for prime-time - a discipline that endures past his death last October.</p><p>\"They have built reg-FD discipline into their channel beyond anything I have ever seen before,\" Gauna said. \"If you don't happen to have a cousin who works on the assembly line at Foxconn, then everybody has an equal playing field.\"</p><p>Looking for an edge, analysts resort to visiting Apple stores on important product-launch dates to count heads and conduct surveys. But they acknowledge the data are not enough to draw firm conclusions.</p><p>\"You try to build a mosaic,\" said Sterne Agee analyst Shaw Wu. \"That's the best you can do.\"</p><p>Another problem is the growing impact from Apple's new product launches, which can skew sales as consumers hold off on purchasing older products in anticipation of newer models. That happened in the September quarter, when Apple's results missed for the first time in four years due to slower-than-expected smartphone sales ahead of the iPhone 4S launch.</p><p>The company then saw a huge spurt in iPhone sales in the December quarter.</p><p>Apple has historically been very conservative in giving guidance, usually handing out estimates far below Street projections. In 2011, Apple underestimated its own revenue by an average of 16 per cent each quarter.</p><p>\"The company wants to keep expectations low and outperform as the quarter goes out,\" said Brian Marshall, analyst with ISI Group.</p><p>There are signs of change, how-ever. In the past two quarters, Chief Executive Tim Cook actually forecast revenue and earnings per share at or above Wall Street estimates. Analysts hope this heralds a more predictable era under Cook.</p><p>\"They're becoming a little more transparent. It'll make it easier for people to understand the story,\" said Sterne Agee's Wu. \"But to be frank, the element of surprise, it's part of their mystique.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Aly Song, Reuters Files; Apple has imposed strict disclosure and confidentiality rules for both suppliers and contractors about its operations.;</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VANSUN-133838071VASN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VANSUN2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54WV-NNC1-JBKR-P52X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"865\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Vancouver Sun, a division of CanWest MediaWorks Publication Inc.

Even if that\u2019s the goal, it doesn\u2019t justify these truly Orwellian means. The fact that the existence of the project was only publicly acknowledged after The Wall Street Journal exposed it indicates that even Google understands how unacceptable this kind of intrusion is.</p><p> Yet the two companies are doing it anyway \u2014 and there\u2019s apparently no law to stop it. That should change.</p><p> As the Journal reported Monday, Google last year penned an agreement with Ascension, the nation\u2019s largest nonprofit health care provider, to gather medical information from facilities across 21 states. The data-sharing endeavor, code named \u201cProject Nightingale,\u201d was started secretly. The data includes patient names, lab results, diagnoses and other information that, as the Journal puts it, \u201camounts to a complete health history\u201d of patients.</p><p> Consider it: Even as you read this, your personal medical information could be getting crunched in a Google database designed to help the company get a foothold in the health care industry. You had no ability to opt out; you were never even told of it, and neither was your doctor.</p><p> The goal is to develop health care focused artificial intelligence tools to improve clinical effectiveness, Ascension said in a statement \u2014 one that came only after the Journal report exposed the secret project. The company stressed it is operating in accordance with federal medical privacy regulations, but that isn\u2019t the point. At least 150 Google employees had access to data on tens of millions of patients. Some Ascension employees have raised ethical concerns about the project.</p><p>Google and other tech giants like Facebook and Twitter operate in a Wild West atmosphere of few regulations, even as they gather information about individual Americans on a scale that has never been possible before. Whether it\u2019s hyper-targeted advertising, manipulation of politics or, now, deep mining of medical data, their ability to access and monetize every corner of Americans\u2019 personal lives is out of control.</p><p>Google and Ascension can cite all the legal justification they want, but the apparent legality of this project only makes it all the more disturbing. Congress should investigate whether any patient data was improperly handled. Just as importantly, it should get aggressive about setting some rules of the road for these tech companies on the gathering and use of personal data. Without them, tech companies will continue to careen out of control.</p><p> REPRINTED FROM THE ST.

Even if that's the goal, it doesn't justify these truly Orwellian means. The fact that the existence of the project was only publicly acknowledged after The Wall Street Journal exposed it indicates that even Google understands how unacceptable this kind of intrusion is.</p><p> Yet the two companies are doing it anyway \u2013 and there's apparently no law to stop it. That should change.</p><p> As the Journal reported Monday, Google last year penned an agreement with Ascension, the nation's largest nonprofit health care provider, to gather medical information from facilities across 21 states, including Missouri and Illinois. The data-sharing endeavor, code named \"Project Nightingale,\" was started secretly. The data includes patient names, lab results, diagnoses and other information that, as the Journal puts it, \"amounts to a complete health history\" of patients.</p><p> Consider it: Even as you read this, your personal medical information could be getting crunched in a Google database designed to help the company get a foothold in the health care industry. You had no ability to opt out; you were never even told of it, and neither was your doctor.</p><p> The goal is to develop health care focused artificial intelligence tools to improve clinical effectiveness, Ascension said in a statement \u2013 one that came only after the Journal report exposed the secret project. The company stressed it is operating in accordance with federal medical privacy regulations, but that isn't the point. At least 150 Google employees had access to data on tens of millions of patients. Some Ascension employees have raised ethical concerns about the project.</p><p>Google and other tech giants like Facebook and Twitter operate in a Wild West atmosphere of few regulations, even as they gather information about individual Americans on a scale that has never been possible before. Whether it's hyper-targeted advertising, manipulation of politics or, now, deep mining of medical data, their ability to access and monetize every corner of Americans' personal lives is out of control.</p><p>Google and Ascension can cite all the legal justification they want, but the apparent legality of this project only makes it all the more disturbing. Congress should investigate whether any patient data was improperly handled. Just as importantly, it should get aggressive about setting some rules of the road for these tech companies on the gathering and use of personal data. Without them, tech companies will continue to careen out of control.</p><p> \u2013 St. Louis Post-Dispatch</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-8460d2d9d92a7d8f2293a69236642aa4a38de</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5F6E919BEC NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJK-R1W1-JBCN-41HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"499\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Daily American<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.\"</p><p>It states that by restricting certain content, the online services are \"engaged in editorial conduct\" and as a result should lose any protection from liability.</p><p>Parsing the law</p><p>Defenders of the law say critics miss the point, that it protects online operators large and small, not just big tech platforms, from content hosted online but produced by users.</p><p>\"Section 230 protects the comments section on a retiree's baking blog as much as it protects Facebook,\" said Matthew Feeny of the libertarian Cato Institute.</p><p>Section 230 effectively implements the US Constitution's First Amendment guarantees of free speech with some procedural streamlining to avoid a wave of litigation, according to legal experts.</p><p>Some say Trump and others are distorting the First Amendment, which was designed to prevent government interference with private expression, as well as Section 230.</p><p>\"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump \u2014 not Trump from Twitter,\" said Ashkhen Kazaryan of the think tank Tech Freedom.</p><p>Law professors Laurence Tribe and Joshua Geltzer, writing in The Washington Post, say that by seeking to regulate content online, \"Trump is already committing the very violation of which he's accusing Twitter.\"</p><p>They write that Section 230 \"was passed precisely to provide social media companies with the flexibility to regulate content on their platforms responsibly, even as they played a very different role from that of traditional publishers because social media companies don't scrutinize content before it is uploaded to their platforms.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/94/159074692520.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/319/1056/94/159074692520.jpeg</url></p><p>Section 230: Internet's wobbly cornerstone<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRNDLY-175661756</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRNDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6012-VJ21-F11P-X2M9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Iran Cultural &amp;

Tech of the Town    \u2014 :  Several major defenders of the tech industry\u2019s embattled legal liability shield are making their case before a Senate subcommittee today on the statute and one of its biggest legislative threats in Congress: the PACT Act.   \u2014 That\u2019s not all: Tech critic Sen. Josh Hawley is unveiling a bill aimed at revoking Section 230 protections from social media platforms that display ads that target users based on their personal traits and online or offline activities.   \u2014 Clap along \u2026 if you feel:  Like today\u2019s Justice Department workshop on music licensing is going to be a whole lot more exciting with Pharrell as a headliner.

Tech of the Town    SENATE COMMERCE EXAMINES SECTION 230 AND \u2018THE PACT ACT\u2019 \u2014 Several Section 230 defenders will make their case this morning before a Senate Commerce panel holding a hearing on the hotly debated statute and a recent bipartisan proposal to change it. 230 co-author Chris Cox and Jeff Kosseff, author of \u201cThe 26 Words That Created the Internet,\u201d will testify alongside Fordham law professor Olivier Sylvain and Elizabeth Banker, deputy general counsel of the Internet Association. On Monday, the trade group released a study on 500 Section 230 decisions that \u201cshow the law continues to perform as Congress intended,\u201d Banker plans to say in her oral testimony.   \u2014 The hearing will zero in on the PACT Act, S. 4066 (116) , a measure introduced in June by Sens. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) and John Thune (R-S.D.) that would give federal regulators and state attorneys general the ability to sue online platforms over user-posted content that violates federal civil law and require large platforms to let consumers appeal their content decisions. That bill \u2014 and a competing bill targeting 230, the EARN IT Act, S. 3398 (116) \u2014 are currently the biggest congressional threats to the tech industry\u2019s legal liability shield.   \u2014 A peek at the testimony: Although Cox, who now represents industry group NetChoice,  plans to outline areas where Section 230 and the PACT Act are aligned, he will also lay out a number of concerns \u2014 including how the new measure \"would undo [the] arrangement\u201d that ensures those who do wrong under the law can be held accountable by civil and criminal law enforcement. \u201cInstead, Section 230 would be waived entirely whenever the federal government or a state attorney general is the litigant. In every such case, websites would lose the protection offered by Section 230,\u201d Cox says in his testimony, shared early with POLITICO.   \u201cThe only conceivable justification for depriving every website of their existing protection under federal law in this way is that state attorney generals and federal prosecutors are presumed always to be right, and websites in such cases are presumed always to be wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cIf so, one wonders why a trial would ever be necessary. \u2026 A blanket presumption that the government is always right is too slender a reed on which to rest an across-the-board statutory repeal of Section 230\u2019s essential provisions.\u201d   \u2014 A peek at the panel: Thune plans to highlight the need for more transparency around content moderation, according to opening remarks shared early with POLITICO. \u201cContent moderation has been \u2014 and largely continues to be \u2014 a black box,\u201d he\u2019ll say, \u201cwhich has led to deep suspicion by many users about bias and discrimination.\u201d     \u2014 Elsewhere in the land of 230: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) today will unveil a standalone bill to revoke Section 230 protections from large online platforms that display certain behavioral ads. The so-called Behavioral Advertising Decisions Are Downgrading Services, or BAD ADS Act, plans for which were first reported by POLITICO , is the latest proposal on Capitol Hill to target tech giants\u2019 sprawling ad businesses . The Hawley bill would apply to companies that host ads targeting users based on their personal traits or previous online and offline behavior.   AND ICYMI: MOVEMENT ON TRUMP\u2019S SOCIAL MEDIA EXECUTIVE ORDER \u2014 The Commerce Department petitioned the FCC on Monday to narrow protections offered under Section 230, \u201cas President Donald Trump directed in May in what he pitched as a crackdown on anti-conservative bias,\u201d John reports for POLITICO . \u201cMonday's petition includes a request that the FCC impose a regulatory requirement on social media companies, even though the agency doesn't regulate them. The FCC is an independent agency outside Trump's direct control.\u201d    \u2018HAPPY\u2019 OR \u2018BLUE\u2019? DOJ RETURNS TO MUSIC LICENSING \u2014 The fate of nearly 80-year-old antitrust decrees between the Justice Department and the two biggest performance-rights organizations are up for debate Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon at a virtual workshop hosted by the agency. As Leah reports for Pros , the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and Broadcast Music Inc. are responsible for distributing more than $2 billion in music royalties each year to 1.75 million songwriters and music publishers.   \u2014 Consent decree review : DOJ\u2019s antitrust division said last year that it would review ASCAP and BMI\u2019s 1940s-era decrees. Top officials from the organizations are set to appear alongside groups representing songwriters and music publishers. Country music singer LeAnn Rimes, who is represented by ASCAP, as well as Pharrell Williams and Jon Bon Jovi, both of whom are represented by another group, Global Music Rights, will also offer thoughts. The groups say the decrees should be revamped to better deal with today\u2019s digital world.   \u2014 Dropping the Mic : But the businesses that pay most of the fees \u2014 which include digital platforms like Pandora and iHeartRadio; terrestrial radio stations and satellite services like Sirius XM; and restaurants, bars, hotels, and performance venues \u2014 want to keep the consents. The MIC Coalition, composed of associations for broadcasters, retailers and the hospitality industry, said the pandemic has made the decrees even more necessary. \u201cCreating more uncertainty \u2014 and even chaos \u2014 in the music licensing space by modifying or terminating the existing consent decrees would be a risky proposition at the best of times, even absent the threat of the current pandemic,\u201d the group said in a comment to DOJ last week.   TECH PRIORITIES MIA IN SENATE GOP\u2019S COVID-19 PLAN  \u2014 As Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his colleagues outlined their opening salvo for coronavirus relief, there were scant sign of tech priorities, no provisions to close the digital divide (even ones top Republicans had floated ) and not even the GOP\u2019s own proposed virus-related data privacy safeguards . Democrats adamantly have pushed for billions of dollars to help keep low-income families and stuck-at-home students digitally connected.   \u2014 The GOP proposal does include $1 billion  to subsidize the FCC\u2019s plan to rip out and replace Huawei and ZTE gear from the U.S. telecom marketplace (half of what FCC Chair Ajit Pai has requested) as well as provisions aimed at boosting the U.S. semiconductor industry.   \u2014 House Energy and Commerce ranking member Greg Walden last week revealed he didn\u2019t see broadband funding as a must. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we need to go down the path of permanent subsidization of broadband connectivity,\u201d the Oregon Republican cautioned Thursday during a Cooley law firm webinar, pointing instead to the telecom industry\u2019s voluntary efforts as well as lawmakers\u2019 other Covid-19 economic assists like direct payments.   \u2014 But with Democrats balking, expect plenty to evolve with negotiation.   LOBBYING LATEST: FOOD STARTUPS HUNGRY FOR INFLUENCE \u2014 DoorDash has hired its second Washington lobbying firm, POLITICO Influence author Theodoric Meyer reports . A team of eight Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld lobbyists, including two former aides to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , will lobby for the delivery startup on \u201cpolicy matters impacting independent workers, consumers, and businesses,\u201d according to a disclosure filing. DoorDash previously hired Cassidy &amp; Associates lobbyists in April, shelling out $70,000 for the firm to lobby on labor and taxes, among other issues.   \u2014 DoorDash\u2019s competitors have stocked up on lobbyists this year, too. Postmates brought on BGR Group last month and also retains the Franklin Square Group, according to disclosure filings. And Instacart added three lobbying firms \u2014 Faegre Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath, Harbinger Strategies and Subject Matter \u2014 in April. The company also retains Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas.          Transitions    Avonne Bell , a former associate attorney in Kelley Drye &amp; Warren\u2019s communications practice group, joined CTIA as its new director for connected life. \u2026 Keith Hontz , former CEO of the email infrastructure company SocketLabs, was named CEO and president of the IT staffing firm Savantis. \u2026 The FCC\u2019s Enforcement Bureau chose USTelecom \u2013 the Broadband Association\u2019s Industry Traceback Group to coordinate industry efforts tracing back illegal robocalls.    Silicon Valley Must Reads    The skinny on Wednesday: What to expect as the big tech CEOs collide with Congress, via Cristiano.   Opinion: \u201cWhy Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are Bad for America,\u201d Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project, and Shaoul Sussman, a lawyer representing an Amazon seller in the House antitrust probe, write in POLITICO.

But here\u2019s the thing: Working remotely isn\u2019t cheap, WSJ reports : \u201cThe pandemic has made business more dependent on cloud-computing than ever\u2014and companies are now racing to rein in the soaring costs\u201d because their budgets are strapped.

There's the myth that it requires platforms to be neutral[1]. There's the myth that if you moderate too much you \"lose\" your status as a \"platform.\"[2] There's the myth that Section 230 of the CDA was \"a gift\" to big tech[3]. None of those are true, and we've gone into great detail over the past few years about how Section 230 is designed to encourage the most \"good\" content, and discourage the most \"bad\" content.[4] It's designed as a pretty straightforward balance, and it actually does a pretty good job of that. However, along with the claims that 230 is a \"gift\" to tech companies, is the unfortunate similar myth that 230 is somehow \"exceptional\" or that it treats internet companies \"different than any other company.\" This has never been true. </p><p>Instead, it's really about properly applying liability to the party actually violating the law, rather than putting the blame on the tools and services they use to violate the law. Brent Skorup and Jennifer Huddleston at the Mercatus Center have now put out an interesting paper, highlighting how -- far from being a \"unique gift\" to internet companies -- Section 230 was merely the codification of basic common law principles[5] regarding liability. The paper carefully traces the history of liability in common law, finding that for decades preceding Section 230, the general common law principles had converged on a concept of \"conduit liability,\" which is more or less what we see in Section 230: you don't blame the \"conduit\" for merely passing along the message.As shown above, even before the creation of Section 230, many courts had shifted from the strict liability regime toward conduit liability protections and fault-based requirements. In many circumstances, liability would not have attached even if the distributor had known of the tortious material, because the social and judicial norms favoring practicable moderation practices and free speech had eroded the traditional liability standards. Section 230, in effect, codified the conduit liability protection that was being applied to traditional media distributors and was sometimes applied even after 1996. As one federal district court noted in 1994, conduit liability '[p]rotection for republication . . . has not been rigorously circumscribed within the wire service context.' In its 1999 Lunney v. Prodigy decision, the highest court in New York expressly classified an internet bulletin board operator as a common-law conduit. An internet service provider and bulletin board operator, the court held, 'like a telephone operator, is merely a conduit.' It made no difference to the court, and the 'conduit designation' was still applied, even when the bulletin board operator 'reserves for itself broad editorial discretion to screen its bulletin board messages' and occasionally exercises that discretion. The court explained that even if Prodigy 'exercised the power to exclude certain vulgarities from the text of certain [bulletin board] messages, this would not alter its passive character in the millions of other messages in whose transmission it did not participate, nor would this, in our opinion, compel it to guarantee the content of those myriad messages.'This doesn't mean, however, that Section 230 serves no purpose. Having 230 the way it is provides significant procedural benefits[6], in the form of having cases kicked out of court quickly, before they become too expensive. Without that, many of these cases, even though they would ultimately be unsuccessful if the court were able to decide, would be prohibitively expensive for internet platforms, creating, in effect, a censorship-by-lawsuit system. While we discussed that (link above) in a previous paper, the authors of this paper actually put dollar amounts on it:Still, Section 230 had a salutary effect at a critical time. A report by Engine estimated that without Section 230, the costs of litigation might be prohibitive for many startups even if they might win the case.155 According to the in-house and external attorneys consulted for the report, having to respond to a user-generated content liability claim through a motion to dismiss could cost $15,000 to $80,000, and having to take such a case through discovery could cost a firm $100,000 to more than half a million dollars.On top of that, Section 230 took away the uncertainty that some random judge might buck the trend -- as happened in the infamous Stratton Oakmont case:As Ardia points out, the statutory protection provided a 'breathing space' and legal certainty after Stratton Oakmont when online providers made decisions regarding third-party content. Stratton Oakmont derailed the legal trend represented by Cubby and the conduit liability cases. A period of uncertainty\u2014and massive 'collateral censorship'\u2014would have ensued because online providers do not know in advance where their users are located. Any provider with users in New York would have been potentially subject to liability for users' posts under the Stratton Oakmont decision. Section 230 precluded that turn of events.However, the idea that Section 230 is somehow \"exceptional\" or provides some rare gift that would not otherwise exist is not supported by the history laid out in this paper. Conduit liability -- protecting the conduit for passing on such information -- was (as the paper lays out in great detail) very much the consensus view among courts, thereby making it the accepted common law, even prior to 230. Finally the paper notes (as have we[7]) that killing Section 230 will harm competition against the big internet companies at a time when we clearly need more competition:In summary, Section 230 provides a blanket liability shield for big and small firms. Change that cuts down the liability protection will thus impose compliance costs on all firms. Such change should be explicit about those social costs and also explicit about the advantage it will grant larger firms that have the resources to become compliant. In other words, going from a blanket to a tailored shield, however well intended, must account for the chilling effect it will have on innovation by startups and small firms, and for the artificial barrier to entry in the market that will grant additional protection to incumbent firms.Either way, as the paper concludes, Section 230 merely was codifying basic common law principles of liability:The Section 230 reform movement is growing, and many of the reform arguments complain that online intermediaries receive a special dispensation regarding publisher liability. The truth is more complicated. Starting in 1931 and for six subsequent decades, courts gradually chipped away the regime of strict liability for publishers and content distributors owing to the practical difficulties of screening all tortious content and to the potential for restricting First Amendment rights. Those courts found that mass media distributors warranted extensive liability protections, including an important protection for conduit liability. The anomalous 1995 Stratton Oakmont decision risked reversing that legal precedent. Yet Congress solved the dissonance by enacting a law that affirmed the precedent and its rationales\u2014the impracticality of holding online content distributors liable and the potential violations of freedom of speech that would ensue from strict liability. Section 230 established a regime of liability protection for online content distributors just when it was needed\u2014at the time internet firms had started to reach audiences of tens of millions\u2014and still provides liability protection for large and small distributors alike. For all the foregoing reasons, we have argued that Section 230 is good policy.I will note that the authors do make a few suggestions on ways they think Section 230 could be amended in a few specific cases, though they note that the situations where that makes sense should be narrow and well-defined. An interesting read all around.Permalink[8] | Comments[9] | Email This Story[10] [ 1]: <url

Advocates on both the political right[4] and left[5] have recently begun to argue more ardently for the repeal or at least reform of Section 230.There is always good reason to consider whether decades-old laws, especially those aimed at rapidly evolving industries, should be updated to reflect both changed circumstances as well as new learning. But discussions over whether and how to reform (or repeal) Section 230 have, thus far, offered far more heat than light.Indeed, later today President Trump will hold a 'social media summit[6]' at the White House to which he has apparently invited a number of right-wing political firebrands \u2014 but no Internet policy experts or scholars and no representatives of social media firms[7]. Nothing about the event suggests it will produce \u2014 or even aim at \u2014 meaningful analysis of the issues. </p><p>Trump himself has already concluded[8] about social media platforms that '[w]hat they are doing is wrong and possibly illegal.' On the basis of that (legally baseless) conclusion, 'a lot of things are being looked at right now.' This is not how good policy decisions are made.The principles we published today are intended to foster an environment in which discussion over these contentious questions may actually be fruitfully pursued. But they also sound a cautionary note. As we write in the preamble to the principles:[W]e value the balance between freely exchanging ideas, fostering innovation, and limiting harmful speech. Because this is an exceptionally delicate balance, Section 230 reform poses a substantial risk of failing to address policymakers' concerns and harming the Internet overall.Neither side in the debate over Section 230 is blameless for the current state of affairs. Reform/repeal proponents have tended to offer ill-considered, irrelevant, or often simply incorrect justifications for amending or tossing Section 230. Meanwhile, many supporters of the law in its current form are reflexively resistant to any change and too quick to dismiss the more reasonable concerns that have been voiced.Most of all, the urge to politicize this issue \u2014 on all sides \u2014 stands squarely in the way of any sensible discussion and thus of any sensible reform.As the diversity of signatories to these principles demonstrates, there is room for reasoned discussion among Section 230 advocates and skeptics alike. For some, these principles represent a significant move from their initial, hard-line positions, undertaken in the face of the very real risk that if they give an inch others will latch on to their concessions to take a mile. They should be commended for their willingness nevertheless to engage seriously with the issues \u2014 and, challenged with de-politicized, sincere, and serious discussion, to change their minds.Everyone who thinks seriously about the issues implicated by Section 230 can \u2014 or should \u2014 agree that it has been instrumental in the birth and growth of the Internet as we know it: both the immense good and the unintended bad. That recognition does not lead inexorably to one conclusion or another regarding the future of Section 230, however.Ensuring that what comes next successfully confronts the problems without negating the benefits starts with the recognition that both costs and benefits exist, and that navigating the trade-offs is a fraught endeavor that absolutely will not be accomplished by romanticized assumptions and simplistic solutions. Efforts to update Section 230 should not deny its past successes, ignore reasonable concerns, nor co-opt the process to score costly political points.But that's just the start. It's incumbent upon those seeking to reform Section 230 to offer ideas and proposals that reflect the reality and the complexity of the world they seek to regulate. The basic principles we published today offer a set of minimum reasonable guardrails for those efforts. Adherence to these principles would allow plenty of scope for potential reforms while helping to ensure that they don't throw out the baby with the bathwater.Accepting, for example, the reality that a 'neutral' presentation of content is impossible (Principle #4) and that platform moderation is complicated and also essential for civil discourse (Principle #3) means admitting that a preferred standard of content moderation is just that \u2014 a preference. It may be defensible to impose that preference on all platforms by operation of law, and these principles do not obviate such a position. But they do demand that such an opinion be rigorously defended. It is insufficient simply to call for 'neutrality' or any other standard ('all ideological voices must be equally represented,' e.g.) without making a valid case for what would be gained and why the inevitable costs and trade-offs would nevertheless be worthwhile.All of us who drafted and/or signed these principles are willing to come to the table to discuss good-faith efforts to reform Section 230 that recognize and reasonably account for such trade-offs. It remains to be seen whether we can wrest the process from those who would use it to promote their static, unrealistic, and politicized vision[9] at the expense of everyone else. Liability for User-Generated Content Online:Principles for Lawmakers Policymakers have expressed concern about both harmful online speech and the content moderation practices of tech companies. Section 230, enacted as part of the bipartisan Communications Decency Act of 1996, says that Internet services, or 'intermediaries,' are not liable for illegal third-party content except with respect to intellectual property, federal criminal prosecutions, communications privacy (ECPA), and sex trafficking (FOSTA). Of course, Internet services remain responsible for content they themselves create.As civil society organizations, academics, and other experts who study the regulation of user-generated content, we value the balance between freely exchanging ideas, fostering innovation, and limiting harmful speech. Because this is an exceptionally delicate balance, Section 230 reform poses a substantial risk of failing to address policymakers' concerns and harming the Internet overall. We hope the following principles help any policymakers considering amendments to Section 230. Principle #1: Content creators bear primary responsibility for their speech and actions. Content creators \u2014 including online services themselves \u2014 bear primary responsibility for their own content and actions. Section 230 has never interfered with holding content creators liable. Instead, Section 230 restricts only who can be liable for the harmful content created by others.Law enforcement online is as important as it is offline. If policymakers believe existing law does not adequately deter bad actors online, they should (i) invest more in the enforcement of existing laws, and (ii) identify and remove obstacles to the enforcement of existing laws. Importantly, while anonymity online can certainly constrain the ability to hold users accountable for their content and actions, courts and litigants have tools to pierce anonymity. And in the rare situation where truly egregious online conduct simply isn't covered by existing criminal law, the law could be expanded. But if policymakers want to avoid chilling American entrepreneurship, it's crucial to avoid imposing criminal liability on online intermediaries or their executives for unlawful user-generated content. Principle #2: Any new intermediary liability must not target constitutionally protected speech. The government shouldn't require \u2014 or coerce \u2014 intermediaries to remove constitutionally protected speech that the government cannot prohibit directly. Such demands violate the First Amendment. Also, imposing broad liability for user speech incentivizes services to err on the side of taking down speech, resulting in overbroad censorship \u2014 or even avoid offering speech forums altogether. Principle #3: The law shouldn't discourage Internet services from moderating content. To flourish, the Internet requires that site managers have the ability to remove legal but objectionable content \u2014 including content that would be protected under the First Amendment from censorship by the government. If Internet services could not prohibit harassment, pornography, racial slurs, and other lawful but offensive or damaging material, they couldn't facilitate civil discourse. Even when Internet services have the ability to moderate content, their moderation efforts will always be imperfect given the vast scale of even relatively small sites and the speed with which content is posted. Section 230 ensures that Internet services can carry out this socially beneficial but error-prone work without exposing themselves to increased liability; penalizing them for imperfect content moderation or second-guessing their decision-making will only discourage them from trying in the first place. This vital principle should remain intact. Principle #4: Section 230 does not, and should not, require 'neutrality.' Publishing third-party content online never can be 'neutral.' Indeed, every publication decision will necessarily prioritize some content at the expense of other content. Even an 'objective' approach, such as presenting content in reverse chronological order, isn't neutral because it prioritizes recency over other values. By protecting the prioritization, deprioritization, and removal of content, Section 230 provides Internet services with the legal certainty they need to do the socially beneficial work of minimizing harmful content. Principle #5: We need a uniform national legal standard. Most Internet services cannot publish content on a state-by-state basis, so state-by-state variations in liability would force compliance with the most restrictive legal standard. In its current form, Section 230 prevents this dilemma by setting a consistent national standard \u2014 which includes potential liability under the uniform body of federal criminal law. Internet services, especially smaller companies and new entrants, would find it difficult, if not impossible, to manage the costs and legal risks of facing potential liability under state civil law, or of bearing the risk of prosecution under state criminal law. Principle #6: We must continue to promote innovation on the Internet. Section 230 encourages innovation in Internet services, especially by smaller services and start-ups who need the most protection from potentially crushing liability. The law must continue to protect intermediaries not merely from liability, but from having to defend against excessive, often-meritless suits \u2014 what one court called 'death by ten thousand duck-bites.' Without such protection, compliance, implementation, and litigation costs could strangle smaller companies before they even emerge, while larger, incumbent technology companies would be much better positioned to absorb these costs. Any proposal to reform Section 230 that is calibrated to what might be possible for the Internet giants will necessarily mis-calibrate the law for smaller services. Principle #7: Section 230 should apply equally across a broad spectrum of online services. Section 230 applies to services that users never interact with directly. The further removed an Internet service \u2014 such as a DDOS protection provider or domain name registrar \u2014 is from an offending user's content or actions, the more blunt its tools to combat objectionable content become. Unlike social media companies or other user-facing services, infrastructure providers cannot take measures like removing individual posts or comments. Instead, they can only shutter entire sites or services, thus risking significant collateral damage to inoffensive or harmless content. Requirements drafted with user-facing services in mind will likely not work for these non-user-facing services.

Others say it allows big platforms to avoid responsibility for harmful content they host.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Section 230 -- which the White House is seeking to curtail as part of its war with Silicon Valley -- was included in the 1996 Communications Decency Act to protect online service providers from lawsuits based on user-generated content.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It reads: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p>The passage is hailed in a 2019 book \"The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet\" by law professor Jeff Kosseff as the basis for the flourishing online economy and services such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia, among others.</p><p>\"Without Section 230, these companies could be sued for their users' blog posts, social media ramblings or homemade online videos.\"</p><p>Kosseff acknowledges that the freewheeling online ecosystem enabled by Section 230 has \"significant social costs\" and that it \"enables terrorist recruitment, online sex trafficking, discriminatory housing sales and vicious harassment.\"</p><p>But he concludes that despite the drawbacks it has fostered \"innovation and freedom\" and delivers a \"net benefit\" to society.</p><p>- Attacked from both sides -</p><p>The legal immunity Section 230 provides has been attacked by President Donald Trump -- especially after Twitter labeled two of his posts this week as misleading -- along with other politicians from the left and right.</p><p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley said earlier this year that the law gives tech companies \"a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability.\"</p><p>Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in January Section 230 should be \"revoked\" in the case of Facebook, which was \"propagating falsehoods.\"</p><p>According to a draft, the White House order states that \"we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.\"</p><p>It states that by restricting certain content, the online services are \"engaged in editorial conduct\" and as a result should lose any protection from liability.</p><p>- Parsing the law -</p><p>Defenders of the law say critics miss the point, that it protects online operators large and small, not just big tech platforms, from content hosted online but produced by users.</p><p>\"Section 230 protects the comments section on a retiree's baking blog as much as it protects Facebook,\" says Matthew Feeny of the libertarian Cato Institute.</p><p>Section 230 effectively implements the US constitution's First Amendment guarantees of free speech with some procedural streamlining to avoid a wave of litigation, according to legal experts.</p><p>Some say Trump and others are distorting the First Amendment, which was designed to prevent government interference with private expression, as well as Section 230.</p><p>\"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump -- not Trump from Twitter,\" says Ashkhen Kazaryan of the think tank Tech Freedom.</p><p>Law professors Laurence Tribe and Joshua Geltzer, writing in The Washington Post, say that by seeking to regulate content online, \"Trump is already committing the very violation of which he's accusing Twitter.\"</p><p>They write that Section 230 \"was passed precisely to provide social media companies with the flexibility to regulate content on their platforms responsibly, even as they played a very different role from that of traditional publishers because social media companies don't scrutinize content before it is uploaded to their platforms.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFP-Section 230 the internet's wobbly cornerstone </dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:600X-3XT1-JBV1-X001-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"614\"/><timeReceived>8:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Agence France Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Agence France Presse -- English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20278\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Others say it allows big platforms to avoid responsibility for harmful content they host.Section 230 -- which the White House is seeking to curtail as part of its war with Silicon Valley -- was included in the 1996 Communications Decency Act to protect online service providers from lawsuits based on user-generated content.It reads: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"The passage is hailed in a 2019 book \"The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet\" by law professor Jeff Kosseff as the basis for the flourishing online economy and services such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia, among others.\"Without Section 230, these companies could be sued for their users' blog posts, social media ramblings or homemade online videos.\"Kosseff acknowledges that the freewheeling online ecosystem enabled by Section 230 has \"significant social costs\" and that it \"enables terrorist recruitment, online sex trafficking, discriminatory housing sales and vicious harassment.\"But he concludes that despite the drawbacks it has fostered \"innovation and freedom\" and delivers a \"net benefit\" to society. The legal immunity Section 230 provides has been attacked by President Donald Trump -- especially after Twitter labeled two of his posts this week as misleading -- along with other politicians from the left and right.Republican Senator Josh Hawley said earlier this year that the law gives tech companies \"a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability.\" </p><p>Twitter's move to label President Donald Trump's tweets as misleading has sparked an angry response from the White House, which is seeking new regulations on internet platforms Photo: AFP / Olivier DOULIERY Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in January Section 230 should be \"revoked\" in the case of Facebook, which was \"propagating falsehoods.\"According to a draft, the White House order states that \"we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.\"It states that by restricting certain content, the online services are \"engaged in editorial conduct\" and as a result should lose any protection from liability.Defenders of the law say critics miss the point, that it protects online operators large and small, not just big tech platforms, from content hosted online but produced by users.\"Section 230 protects the comments section on a retiree's baking blog as much as it protects Facebook,\" says Matthew Feeny of the libertarian Cato Institute.Section 230 effectively implements the US constitution's First Amendment guarantees of free speech with some procedural streamlining to avoid a wave of litigation, according to legal experts.Some say Trump and others are distorting the First Amendment, which was designed to prevent government interference with private expression, as well as Section 230.\"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump -- not Trump from Twitter,\" says Ashkhen Kazaryan of the think tank Tech Freedom.Law professors Laurence Tribe and Joshua Geltzer, writing in The Washington Post, say that by seeking to regulate content online, \"Trump is already committing the very violation of which he's accusing Twitter.\"They write that Section 230 \"was passed precisely to provide social media companies with the flexibility to regulate content on their platforms responsibly, even as they played a very different role from that of traditional publishers because social media companies don't scrutinize content before it is uploaded to their platforms.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX108767159069874377725876100089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N4D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><timeReceived>8:45 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Others say it allows big platforms to avoid responsibility for harmful content they host. Section 230 -- which the White House is seeking to curtail as part of its war with Silicon Valley -- was included in the 1996 Communications Decency Act to protect online service providers from lawsuits based on user-generated content. </p><p>It reads: \"No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" The passage is hailed in a 2019 book \"The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet\" by law professor Jeff Kosseff as the basis for the flourishing online economy and services such as Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia, among others. \"Without Section 230, these companies could be sued for their users' blog posts, social media ramblings or homemade online videos.\" Kosseff acknowledges that the freewheeling online ecosystem enabled by Section 230 has \"significant social costs\" and that it \"enables terrorist recruitment, online sex trafficking, discriminatory housing sales and vicious harassment.\" But he concludes that despite the drawbacks it has fostered \"innovation and freedom\" and delivers a \"net benefit\" to society.The legal immunity Section 230 provides has been attacked by President Donald Trump -- especially after Twitter labeled two of his posts this week as misleading -- along with other politicians from the left and right. Republican Senator Josh Hawley said earlier this year that the law gives tech companies \"a sweetheart deal that no other industry enjoys: complete exemption from traditional publisher liability.\"Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in January Section 230 should be \"revoked\" in the case of Facebook, which was \"propagating falsehoods.\" According to a draft, the White House order states that \"we cannot allow a limited number of online platforms to hand-pick the speech that Americans may access and convey online. This practice is fundamentally un-American and anti-democratic.\" It states that by restricting certain content, the online services are \"engaged in editorial conduct\" and as a result should lose any protection from liability.Defenders of the law say critics miss the point, that it protects online operators large and small, not just big tech platforms, from content hosted online but produced by users. \"Section 230 protects the comments section on a retiree's baking blog as much as it protects Facebook,\" says Matthew Feeny of the libertarian Cato Institute. Section 230 effectively implements the US constitution's First Amendment guarantees of free speech with some procedural streamlining to avoid a wave of litigation, according to legal experts. Some say Trump and others are distorting the First Amendment, which was designed to prevent government interference with private expression, as well as Section 230. \"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump -- not Trump from Twitter,\" says Ashkhen Kazaryan of the think tank Tech Freedom. Law professors Laurence Tribe and Joshua Geltzer, writing in The Washington Post, say that by seeking to regulate content online, \"Trump is already committing the very violation of which he's accusing Twitter.\" They write that Section 230 \"was passed precisely to provide social media companies with the flexibility to regulate content on their platforms responsibly, even as they played a very different role from that of traditional publishers because social media companies don't scrutinize content before it is uploaded to their platforms.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159070001288775776100121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6011-B8Y1-F03R-N4GF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"626\"/><timeReceived>9:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 28, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The companies have invoked this federal law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in one court case after another to dismiss potentially costly lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, big changes could be coming to Section 230 that might expose Facebook, YouTube and others to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation for the first time in their histories. If it happens, there could be sweeping repercussions for the internet platforms millions of people use every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As social media sites have become hotbeds of hateful, misleading and dangerous content, an increasingly vocal group of critics from government and civil society are pushing for changes to the law. Congress and the Justice Department are now studying the issue: A draft bill by Sen. Lindsey Graham as well as legislation introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley promise to dramatically reshape Section 230, and the DOJ last week held a public workshop to debate the matter.</p><p>The push to rethink the law could become the latest flash point between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration. Together with state attorneys general, news publishers and online safety activists, Attorney General William Barr has elevated a campaign to weaken, if not repeal, the law, which dates back to 1996, years before companies like Facebook, Google and their peers were founded.</p><p>The proposals challenge the deeply held conviction in Silicon Valley that social media companies are just neutral platforms and conduits for information. And they could vastly expand the companies' legal exposure, not only to federal prosecution but potentially state and private lawsuits.</p><p>\"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Barr said at last week's Justice Department workshop. \"They have become titans of US industry. Given this change in the technology landscape, valid questions have been raised as to whether Section 230's broad immunity is still necessary, at least in its current form.\"</p><p>\"The 26 words that created the internet\"</p><p>The original intent behind Section 230 was to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. One of its key architects, Sen. Ron Wyden, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-statement-on-calls-to-regulate-speech-online-and-repeal-section-230-of-the-communications-decency-act\">said as recently as last year </url>that without the law, \"all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful.\" He's also said Section 230 encourages websites to remove objectionable content by creating a \"good Samaritan\" expectation: Under the law, tech companies can't be sued for trying to do the right thing, though the federal government can still sue platforms over criminal content.</p><p>The seemingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">simple language</url> of Section 230 belies the sweeping impact it's had on the tech industry. Under Section 230, \"interactive computer services\" are considered legally separate from the users who generate their content. They can't be said to publish or \"speak\" the words of their users. In practice, courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it's  AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential that Section 230 has come to be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/\">described</url> as \"the 26 words that created the internet.\"</p><p>The Internet Association, a major trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, has called Section 230 a \"fundamental pillar\" of the modern internet, saying it protects not just tech companies but all groups that offer a space for online communications, including schools, libraries, churches, or neighborhood organizations.</p><p>\"Section 230 enables services that allows internet users to post their own content and engage with the content of others, whether that's friends, family, co-workers, companies posting jobs, someone posting an apartment for rent, fellow gamers, or complete strangers from the other side of the globe with a shared experience or interest,\" the association wrote to Barr in a letter last week.</p><p>But the immense scrutiny facing Big Tech - on everything from election security to privacy - has created a ripe political environment for questioning Silicon Valley's most important legal shield.</p><p>Are tech companies doing enough?</p><p>At last weeks' workshop, experts clashed over how much legal responsibility tech companies should bear for hosting malicious content created by its users.</p><p>Social media companies say they're improving their ability to detect and take down content that violates their policies. \"Section 230 protects the good actors who are cutting off the bad actors,\" Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents many large tech companies, said at Wednesday's DOJ event. Without the law's good Samaritan protections, the industry argues, much of that good-faith moderation might end.</p><p>Weakening Section 230 could also force websites to vet every piece of content created by their users before it goes online, according to defenders of the law - a task that only large and already powerful players like Facebook may be able to afford. Smaller, competing innovators that could break the grip of Google and Facebook might be snuffed out, said Patrick Carome, a lawyer who has represented tech companies in cases involving Section 230, at last week's event.</p><p>But critics accuse tech companies of abusing their legal immunity to turn a blind eye to some of the worst content on the internet. These critics allege that powerful online platforms allow harmful material to stay online because it drives engagement - and profit.</p><p>\"Their financial incentives in content distribution may not always align with what is best for the user,\" Barr said at the event.</p><p>To help drive the message home, the Justice Department has turned to child abuse experts who say companies like Facebook must bear responsibility for the child pornography and sexual predators that lurk on its platform.</p><p>Facebook said it  against more than 24 million pieces of child exploitative content last year. Most of it, the company has said, was caught automatically by Facebook's filters and that \"we remove much of this content before people see it.\"</p><p>Despite those successes, child sexual abuse content is still a widespread problem, said Yiota Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, at Wednesday's event. Last year, the non-profit group received about <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/gethelp/2019-reports-by-esp.pdf\">17 million reports</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/legal\">protected</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement#child-nudity-and-sexual-exploitation\">took action</url> of online child exploitation, including over 15 million linked to Facebook, nearly half a million concerning Google and tens of thousands related to Microsoft, Imgur and Snapchat, among others.</p><p>One proposal backed by state attorneys general would amend Section 230 by giving them the power to sue platforms for hosting child abuse material, just like the federal government can.</p><p>\"We'll clean up your industry, instead of waiting for your industry to clean up itself,\" said Doug Peterson, Nebraska's attorney general, at the DOJ workshop.</p><p>A fierce debate heats up over the future of the internet</p><p>The Section 230 debate is tied to another politically charged tech issue: encryption, the technology that secures many everyday transactions ranging from iMessages to credit card swipes to sensitive business and government databases.</p><p>Souras said online child exploitation will only get worse if Facebook moves ahead with plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms, scrambling their contents so that not even the company knows what child abusers may be saying - and to whom - in private.</p><p>The thought of bad actors \"going dark\" has long been a fear of the FBI, which has asked companies like Apple for help decrypting the secure data of criminal suspects. But Apple and the tech industry have resisted. They've argued that giving the authorities a special way to tap into encrypted communications will encourage hackers and foreign adversaries to exploit the same tool. If that happens, it could ultimately weaken digital security for millions of Americans.</p><p>Some legal experts worry the Trump administration's push to impose new rules on tech companies could lead to broad expansions of government power. Those perceptions were reinforced earlier this month when Sen. Graham's draft bill on Section 230 began circulating around Washington.</p><p>The bill seeks to withhold Section 230's legal protections from tech companies unless they agree to implement \"best practices\" that would be designed by a commission and ultimately approved by the attorney general.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/04/huge-tech-campus-office-16-terrace-launches-downtown-san-jose-groundbreaking-google-adobe-office-real-estate/\">           $1 billion tech campus breaks ground in downtown San Jose near Google village       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/04/coronavirus-google-scraps-i-o-event-as-disease-continues-to-spread/\">           Coronavirus: Google scraps I/O event as disease continues to spread       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/03/elon-musk-defends-twitters-jack-dorsey-as-activist-investor-looms/\">           Elon Musk defends Twitter's Jack Dorsey as activist investor looms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-facebook-intel-twitter-drop-out-of-sxsw-as-disease-spreads/\">           Coronavirus: Facebook, Intel, Twitter drop out of SXSW as disease spreads       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-twitter-tells-employees-they-should-work-from-home/\">           Coronavirus: Twitter tells employees they should work from home       </url>   Technology and legal experts slammed the bill, saying it would give Barr a blank check to write his own regulations designed to weaken encryption, expand domestic surveillance, and force tech companies to undermine user security using the threat of lawsuits.</p><p>In other words, the deep, longstanding divide over encryption between tech and government may be driving some of the recent conversation around content policy.</p><p>\"Barr is cynically exploiting [child sexual abuse material] as a pretext for attacking the privacy of law-abiding Americans who would benefit from having secure communications tools,\" said Berin Szoka, president of the Washington-based think tank TechFreedom.</p><p>The-CNN-Wire<url normalizedValue=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\"/> &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The companies have invoked this federal law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, in one court case after another to dismiss potentially costly lawsuits over messages, videos and other content created by users.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But now, big changes could be coming to Section 230 that might expose Facebook, YouTube and others to more lawsuits over hate speech and misinformation for the first time in their histories. If it happens, there could be sweeping repercussions for the internet platforms millions of people use every day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As social media sites have become hotbeds of hateful, misleading and dangerous content, an increasingly vocal group of critics from government and civil society are pushing for changes to the law. Congress and the Justice Department are now studying the issue: A draft bill by Sen. Lindsey Graham as well as legislation introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley promise to dramatically reshape Section 230, and the DOJ last week held a public workshop to debate the matter.</p><p>The push to rethink the law could become the latest flash point between Silicon Valley and the Trump administration. Together with state attorneys general, news publishers and online safety activists, Attorney General William Barr has elevated a campaign to weaken, if not repeal, the law, which dates back to 1996, years before companies like Facebook, Google and their peers were founded.</p><p>The proposals challenge the deeply held conviction in Silicon Valley that social media companies are just neutral platforms and conduits for information. And they could vastly expand the companies' legal exposure, not only to federal prosecution but potentially state and private lawsuits.</p><p>\"No longer are tech companies the underdog upstarts,\" Barr said at last week's Justice Department workshop. \"They have become titans of US industry. Given this change in the technology landscape, valid questions have been raised as to whether Section 230's broad immunity is still necessary, at least in its current form.\"</p><p>\"The 26 words that created the internet\"</p><p>The original intent behind Section 230 was to nurture startups and entrepreneurs. One of its key architects, Sen. Ron Wyden, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-statement-on-calls-to-regulate-speech-online-and-repeal-section-230-of-the-communications-decency-act\">said as recently as last year </url>that without the law, \"all online media would face an onslaught of bad-faith lawsuits and pressure campaigns from the powerful.\" He's also said Section 230 encourages websites to remove objectionable content by creating a \"good Samaritan\" expectation: Under the law, tech companies can't be sued for trying to do the right thing, though the federal government can still sue platforms over criminal content.</p><p>The seemingly <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230\">simple language</url> of Section 230 belies the sweeping impact it's had on the tech industry. Under Section 230, \"interactive computer services\" are considered legally separate from the users who generate their content. They can't be said to publish or \"speak\" the words of their users. In practice, courts have repeatedly accepted Section 230 as a defense against claims of defamation, negligence and other allegations. In the past, it's  AOL, Craigslist, Google and Yahoo, building up a body of law so broad and influential that Section 230 has come to be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501714412/the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet/\">described</url> as \"the 26 words that created the internet.\"</p><p>The Internet Association, a major trade group that represents Amazon, Facebook and Google, has called Section 230 a \"fundamental pillar\" of the modern internet, saying it protects not just tech companies but all groups that offer a space for online communications, including schools, libraries, churches, or neighborhood organizations.</p><p>\"Section 230 enables services that allows internet users to post their own content and engage with the content of others, whether that's friends, family, co-workers, companies posting jobs, someone posting an apartment for rent, fellow gamers, or complete strangers from the other side of the globe with a shared experience or interest,\" the association wrote to Barr in a letter last week.</p><p>But the immense scrutiny facing Big Tech - on everything from election security to privacy - has created a ripe political environment for questioning Silicon Valley's most important legal shield.</p><p>Are tech companies doing enough?</p><p>At last weeks' workshop, experts clashed over how much legal responsibility tech companies should bear for hosting malicious content created by its users.</p><p>Social media companies say they're improving their ability to detect and take down content that violates their policies. \"Section 230 protects the good actors who are cutting off the bad actors,\" Matt Schruers, president of the Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association, a trade group that represents many large tech companies, said at Wednesday's DOJ event. Without the law's good Samaritan protections, the industry argues, much of that good-faith moderation might end.</p><p>Weakening Section 230 could also force websites to vet every piece of content created by their users before it goes online, according to defenders of the law - a task that only large and already powerful players like Facebook may be able to afford. Smaller, competing innovators that could break the grip of Google and Facebook might be snuffed out, said Patrick Carome, a lawyer who has represented tech companies in cases involving Section 230, at last week's event.</p><p>But critics accuse tech companies of abusing their legal immunity to turn a blind eye to some of the worst content on the internet. These critics allege that powerful online platforms allow harmful material to stay online because it drives engagement - and profit.</p><p>\"Their financial incentives in content distribution may not always align with what is best for the user,\" Barr said at the event.</p><p>To help drive the message home, the Justice Department has turned to child abuse experts who say companies like Facebook must bear responsibility for the child pornography and sexual predators that lurk on its platform.</p><p>Facebook said it  against more than 24 million pieces of child exploitative content last year. Most of it, the company has said, was caught automatically by Facebook's filters and that \"we remove much of this content before people see it.\"</p><p>Despite those successes, child sexual abuse content is still a widespread problem, said Yiota Souras, general counsel for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, at Wednesday's event. Last year, the non-profit group received about <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.missingkids.org/content/dam/missingkids/gethelp/2019-reports-by-esp.pdf\">17 million reports</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230/legal\">protected</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement#child-nudity-and-sexual-exploitation\">took action</url> of online child exploitation, including over 15 million linked to Facebook, nearly half a million concerning Google and tens of thousands related to Microsoft, Imgur and Snapchat, among others.</p><p>One proposal backed by state attorneys general would amend Section 230 by giving them the power to sue platforms for hosting child abuse material, just like the federal government can.</p><p>\"We'll clean up your industry, instead of waiting for your industry to clean up itself,\" said Doug Peterson, Nebraska's attorney general, at the DOJ workshop.</p><p>A fierce debate heats up over the future of the internet</p><p>The Section 230 debate is tied to another politically charged tech issue: encryption, the technology that secures many everyday transactions ranging from iMessages to credit card swipes to sensitive business and government databases.</p><p>Souras said online child exploitation will only get worse if Facebook moves ahead with plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms, scrambling their contents so that not even the company knows what child abusers may be saying - and to whom - in private.</p><p>The thought of bad actors \"going dark\" has long been a fear of the FBI, which has asked companies like Apple for help decrypting the secure data of criminal suspects. But Apple and the tech industry have resisted. They've argued that giving the authorities a special way to tap into encrypted communications will encourage hackers and foreign adversaries to exploit the same tool. If that happens, it could ultimately weaken digital security for millions of Americans.</p><p>Some legal experts worry the Trump administration's push to impose new rules on tech companies could lead to broad expansions of government power. Those perceptions were reinforced earlier this month when Sen. Graham's draft bill on Section 230 began circulating around Washington.</p><p>The bill seeks to withhold Section 230's legal protections from tech companies unless they agree to implement \"best practices\" that would be designed by a commission and ultimately approved by the attorney general.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/03/04/huge-tech-campus-office-16-terrace-launches-downtown-san-jose-groundbreaking-google-adobe-office-real-estate/\">           $1 billion tech campus breaks ground in downtown San Jose near Google village       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/03/04/coronavirus-google-scraps-i-o-event-as-disease-continues-to-spread/\">           Coronavirus: Google scraps I/O event as disease continues to spread       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/03/03/elon-musk-defends-twitters-jack-dorsey-as-activist-investor-looms/\">           Elon Musk defends Twitter's Jack Dorsey as activist investor looms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-facebook-intel-twitter-drop-out-of-sxsw-as-disease-spreads/\">           Coronavirus: Facebook, Intel, Twitter drop out of SXSW as disease spreads       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-twitter-tells-employees-they-should-work-from-home/\">           Coronavirus: Twitter tells employees they should work from home       </url>   Technology and legal experts slammed the bill, saying it would give Barr a blank check to write his own regulations designed to weaken encryption, expand domestic surveillance, and force tech companies to undermine user security using the threat of lawsuits.</p><p>In other words, the deep, longstanding divide over encryption between tech and government may be driving some of the recent conversation around content policy.</p><p>\"Barr is cynically exploiting [child sexual abuse material] as a pretext for attacking the privacy of law-abiding Americans who would benefit from having secure communications tools,\" said Berin Szoka, president of the Washington-based think tank TechFreedom.</p><p>The-CNN-Wire<url normalizedValue=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\"/> &amp; \u00a9 2020 Cable News Network, Inc., a WarnerMedia Company.

The FTC is empowered to take action for false and deceptive conduct.</p><p>Then, he said, there is the pain of \"knowing others are deriving pleasure and profit\" from the death of his daughter and other \"moment of death\" videos.

Although I rarely trust market moves on the last day of a quarter or the first day of a new quarter, there is little doubt that market volatility is back this year, as I expected it would be. Last year, rather than enduring scary selloffs to correct imbalances, the market simply rotated into neglected market segments from time to time. This conviction to stay invested was largely due to consistent improvement in global economic fundamentals coupled with rising optimism about new fiscal stimulus - leading to a fear of missing out. </p><p>But given the passage of the tax bill and plenty of progress with deregulation last year, I expected investors this year to display more of a Missourian 'show me' attitude as to what Corporate America actually would do with their newfound cash windfalls and looser regulatory noose. Would this truly spell the end of the capex recession, ushering in a new wave of onshoring, PP...pgrades, hiring, buybacks, and M...For their part, sell-side analysts have been raising corporate earnings estimates at a historically fast pace. But the proof is in the pudding, as they say, and the price run-up and elevated valuation multiples (that arose in anticipation of tax cuts and new corporate investment) were due for compression, as speculation gives way to reality, along with some 'price rationalization' and deleveraging of speculative portfolios. And on top of those dynamics, the market is suddenly fretting about tariffs, trade wars, inflationary pressures, and the Fed. Nevertheless, there seems to be something for all investors to hold on to, as both fundamentalists and technicians alike should be excited by the lower valuations and successful tests of support in a climate of robust growth and corporate earnings. But I'm not talking about a return to market conditions of old, characterized by falling interest rates, slow growth, and low volatility, which rewarded passive investing in cap-weighted indexes with elevated P/E's. Instead, we likely are entering a new era, characterized by rising interest rates, faster growth, and higher volatility, which rewards sound stock-picking. In this periodic update, I provide a market commentary, offer my technical analysis of the S...00, review Sabrient's latest fundamentals-based SectorCast rankings of the ten US business sectors, and serve up some actionable ETF trading ideas. In summary, our sector rankings still look bullish, while the sector rotation model has fallen into a neutral posture during this period of consolidation and testing of support levels. Read on....[1] Market Commentary: Investors seem to be focusing more on the threats than the opportunities right now. Besides P/E compression, price rationalization, deleveraging, and a fledgling rotation away from the dominant Momentum factor, investors are trying to assess the likely impact of the myriad news headlines, such as the President's actions to address unfair trade agreements with tariffs meant to cajole some accommodation from our global trade partners. In addition, some of the mega-cap Tech stocks (e.g., FAANG) that have led the market for so long are seeing their business practices under attack, especially Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB). Also, we have a huge $1.3 trillion federal omnibus budget(despite full employment and solid GDP growth that would normally suggest a budget surplus) that some claim will bankrupt the nation. To be sure, there is nothing desirable about a budget deficit of $1 trillion and a national debt of $22 trillion (21% of GDP). And then there is the fear among some observers that new Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell is more concerned with normalizing short-term rates than he is about supporting the economy (the proverbial 'Fed put'). Not to be outdone, Barron's opined that corporate earnings growth expectations are so exuberant that there is likely more downside risk than upside potential as the earnings reports come in. Meanwhile, some market commentators are pointing to the strengthening technical condition of gold and bonds to say that stocks are in for more pain ahead. And lenders appear to be tightening their credit standards and lending less, suggesting all is not well on Main Street. In other words, there are plenty of negative narratives flying around, and for the moment they are giving rise to the dreaded climate (previously witnessed in the 2H2015-1H2016 timeframe) of news-driven risk-on/risk-off trading, rising correlations, higher volatility, and reduced strategic equity exposures. However, all is not lost. On the contrary, there is no denying the underlying strength in the global economy and the continuously improving outlook for US corporate earnings. In fact, it's hard to fully predict all the various impacts (both direct and indirect) we will see from tax reform and deregulation over the next few years. 1Q2018 earnings reports are on tap in just a matter of days, and with the tailwind of massive tax cuts (corporate tax rates falling from 35% to 21%), consensus S...00 earnings are expected to grow +17% year-over-year versus 1Q2017 (up from expected Q1 growth of +11% at the beginning of the year and the best year-over-year performance since 1Q2011) - and many well-selected stocks should do quite a bit better. Moreover, economists generally expect GDP growth to come in somewhere in the 2.5-3.0% range, compared with 1.2% in 1Q2017. Inflation fears have tempered, bonds have caught a bid, and extreme equity valuations have fallen as technical support levels have been tested. And don't forget, spring is in the air, which is a seasonally strong time for stocks, and Morgan Stanley estimates that about $400 billion in global dividends will be paid out this quarter, adding further buying fuel. President Trump's newly-imposed tariffs and his venting about Amazon's fleecing of the taxpayer by minimizing its taxable income and by leveraging a government-subsidized US Post Office - not to mention its ability to steamroll both large corporate competitors and Mom-and-Pop shops alike - have certainly spooked the markets. After all, tariffs may spark a global trade war, right? And Amazon represents the future of commerce as it shakes up the world through 'creative disruption' to the long-term benefit of us all, right? Well, perhaps, but to me these are simply the latest examples of Trump's negotiating style, as he tries to stand up for the little guy without actually derailing growth in both the economy and the stock market that he so covets. Rather than watch trade negotiations languish in committee for years on end with no resolution, he skips the diplomacy and instills a sense of urgency with the stroke of a pen and some tough language. Likewise, rather than quietly cajole Jeff Bezos to pay higher shipping rates, he tries to humiliate him into submission. Remember his tough talk to Russia and North Korea about his willingness to engage in a nuclear arms race that we would 'easily win'? Sounds a lot like his tariff talk today. We know that Canada and Mexico have already gotten reprieves, given that they have shown good faith in renegotiating NAFTA. Then, the EU was also excluded, and the announcement came that countries could apply for relief from the new duties. Of note, the Mexican peso has been the strongest performing currency in the world so far this year. In any case, we are too deeply in debt to engage in a full-blown trade war, with $22 trillion in total federal debt and a newly jacked-up budget deficit to boot. In fact, the whole world is too indebted for it. After initially announcing a small retaliatory response, South Korea agreed to revise its 6-year-old bilateral trade deal, and China is opting for a conciliatory approach, as well, despite the mild retaliatory moves the press is hyping. After all, the US has a $375 billion trade deficit with China, which puts us in the stronger position. China cannot afford any impediments to its aggressive growth targets. It is already on a path to liberalizing foreign investment - by necessity. Given that its rapidly growing status as an economic power is eroding its ability to continue to leverage low labor costs in a (largely subsidized) manufacturing economy and dump cheap goods on the rest of the world, China knows that it must encourage consumption from its growing middle class and allow more foreign capital to flow into the country. Chinese bonds soon will be added to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, which is widely followed by fund managers, andJPMorgan is considering adding Chinese bonds to its Government Bond Index.This will attract passive flows (e.g., ETFs) of global capital into China's bond market - estimated by Goldman Sachs to perhaps exceed $250 billion. Furthermore, MSCI is adding mainland-China stocks to its emerging markets index, which could result in $500 billion in passive flows. So, as its current account surplus falls, its capital and financial account deficits will also fall, offsetting the impact. A rotation out of the narrow list of mega-cap Tech and into a broader group of market segments (including other big-Tech names outside of the FAANG gang) seems to be unfolding. I think this is healthy broadening behavior, and I think the actual impact on these companies' bottom lines is being way overblown such that they will find interested buyers soon enough. But Jim Paulsen, the chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, tracks the ratio of Technology versus Utilities stocks, which is rolling over in a pattern that he thinks resembles the dot-com crash, as momentum darlings are suddenly shunned. But let's make sure we are comparing apples to apples here. Valuations, cash flows, and cash balances today are so much healthier than they were 20 years ago, and there has been no artificial demand for technology upgrades today as was seen in advance of the Y2K scare. State Street Global Advisors reports that aggregate US-listed ETFs saw consecutive monthly outflows for the first time since 2008, although Q1 overall (with a big January of inflows) still saw the 'second-best start to a year ever.' During Monday's selloff, the S...00 retested its intraday peak (1/26/2018) to trough (2/9/2018) drawdown of -11.7%, although the recovery this time around didn't quite recover the 200-day simple moving average. S...ow Jones Indices reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke a string of nine straight positive quarters with a loss of -2.49% during 1Q2018. Also, the quarter witnessed a continuation of the factor performance themes of 2017, with Growth and Momentum factors dominating at the expense of Value, Quality, and Low-volatility, while rising short-term rates lessened the appeal of dividend payers. However, they noted signs of a reversal late in the quarter, and the Momentum factor's risk profile is most concentrated 'toward large cap, high beta, and technology stocks,' leaving it vulnerable to 'higher drawdown risk compared to other strategies.' Furthermore, the firm reported an interesting observation that small-cap Healthcare was up an impressive +13% during Q1. No other market segments were even close, with mid-cap Healthcare (+6%), mid-cap Tech (+4%) as distant runners-up. Despite the worrisome market action, nothing has changed in the fundamental picture of synchronized global economic expansion, impressive US economic reports, strong US corporate cash flow and earnings, as well as high cash balances. Unemployment remains near 1960 lows. Inflation is modest. Interest rates remain low. Deregulation has freed up the resources of companies, which is especially helpful to small- and mid-caps. And of course, the biggest tax overhaul in a generation is just starting to gain traction - incentivizing capital investment, expansion, onshoring of offshore operations, and hiring, as well as higher dividends, continued share buybacks, and additional M...They might even pay down some debt. Let's talk about the latest economic reports. Weekly jobless claims fell to a 45-year low. The Conference Board's LEI is strong and rising. Housing and mortgage reports are solid. Retail and wholesale inventories rose nicely. Consumer Confidence and Investor Confidence remain quite strong, with a broad-based demand for equities among global institutional investors. The BEA's third estimate of real GDP in 4Q17 was increased to 2.9%, reflecting 'a downturn in private inventory investment that was partly offset by accelerations in PCE, exports, state and local government spending, nonresidential fixed investment, and federal government spending, and an upturn in residential fixed investment.' For 1Q18, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model was just updated Monday morning with a higher forecast of 2.8% (due to higher expected consumer spending and private fixed investment), while the New York Fed's Nowcast model projects 2.7% for 1Q18 and 2.9% for 2Q18. After the quarter-point rate hike in March, the current target fed funds rate is 1.50-1.75%, and the Fed \"dot plot\" still projects two more rate hikes this year, which would bring the target rate to a 2.00-2.25% range by year end. CME fed funds futures currently place the odds of rate hike #2 coming at the June meeting at 81%, and by September there is a 53% chance of the third rate hike. By the December meeting, there is a 73% chance of a third hike, 30% probability of a fourth quarter-point rate hike, and a small 4.3% chance of a fifth hike - but also a significant 27% chance that the fed funds rate will remain at 1.75%-2.00% (i.e., only two rate hikes this year). After briefly spiking on inflation fears before finding resistance at the 3.0% level, the 10-year Treasury continues to catch a bid. It closed Tuesday at 2.78%, while the 2-year closed at 2.28%. The closely-watched 2-10 spread continues to flatten and is now at 50 bps - well under the 100 bps 'normalcy threshold,' causing many Fed-watchers to worry that the new Fed chair Jerome Powell is more concerned with normalizing short-term rates than he is about supporting the economy with the 'Fed Put.' But I think Powell is just trying to exude confidence in the economy, and he certainly will act as necessary to prevent the yield curve from inverting or the economy from falling into recession. DataTrek has pointed out that the markets seem to be watching the breakeven rate between Treasury yields and Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) of the same term, and the differential for both 5-year and 10-year terms currently implies future inflation right around the Fed's 2% target rate. In other words, no runaway inflation. After last year's talk about a 'new normal' of lower volatility, the market is now coming to terms with the notion that elevated volatility is here to stay - at least this year given the uncertainties of tariffs and mid-term elections. DataTrek observed that the S...00 registered 23 daily returns of +/- 1% (or more) during Q1, compared to only 8 during all of last year. The CBOE Market Volatility Index (VIX), aka 'fear gauge,' closed Q1 at 19.97 - right at the 'panic threshold' of 20, and this elevated volatility has led to elevated sector correlations and some risk-on/risk-off behavior. VIX closed Monday at 23.62 (after spiking above 25), but then closed rebound Tuesday at 21.10. All things considered, I see equity valuations as being quite attractive right now. The forward next-12-months (NTM) P/E on the S...00 is around 16.5x, so flipping it upside down equates to an earnings yield of 6.0%. Compared to the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.78%, that's an equity risk/inflation premium of about 3.2%. And with robust EPS growth firmly in the pipeline, I expect the S...00 to see a double-digit return by year-end, even as share price growth falls back in better alignment with earnings growth (where it belongs). Let's throw around some numbers. If the forward P/E at the end of 2018 is 17.5x (6% higher than the current forward P/E but still lower than the 18.5x at the beginning of the year, reflecting the multiple compression I have expected for this year) and earnings are projected to grow by 10% in 2019, then the S...00 would finish the year roughly 16% higher than it is now - or around 3,030 - which would indicate a price return for 2018 of around 13% and a total return (including dividends) of nearly 15%. If instead the forward P/E compresses to 17x by year-end, that would imply a price return of about 10% and total return of nearly 12%. And I am not alone. JPMorgan's U.S. equity strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas just reiterated his year-end 3,000 target for the S...00, opining last week that the selling has been largely technical, trend-following, and/or options hedging (in response to all the negative news headlines), 'and as such represents a buying opportunity for fundamental investors' and that 'strong macro and fundamentals will continue to prevail.' Of course, 12-15% total return for the year on the S...00 is not bad at all. But I think a well-selected portfolio of attractive 'growth at a reasonable price' (GARP) stocks has the potential to perform even better. This is what Sabrient seeks to do with our various GARP portfolios, including our monthly all-cap Baker's Dozen. (Note: We also publish other GARP-oriented portfolios focused on market segments like small caps, dividend income, stocks for a rising interest-rate environment, and defensive equity.) In particular, I still see small caps as a good bet, especially given that they stand to benefit the most from lower tax rates, deregulation, and M...ctivity. Moreover, I think this year will see heightened focus on fundamentally sound companies across all caps, as well as the Value and Quality factors, targeting market segments with attractive GARP characteristics that cannot be ignored any longer. Let me finish my commentary today with a simple plea. I think the key to diminishing our country's extreme political polarity and restoring unity and cooperation can be found in one simple exhortation. It is actually Habit 5 of Stephen Covey's 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: 'Seek first to understand, then to be understood.' It sounds so simple, so logical, so easy. But it is not, particularly in such a toxic political climate. Rather than dismissing the other side as either cruel or nave, unfeeling or unthinking, strident or hypocritical, instead seek to truly understand the full nature and backdrop of the other viewpoint. Then and only then, should you articulate your own. Notably, the old Roseanne TV comedy show has returned with the same cast and huge ratings right out of the gateplus at least one stated objective of fostering a political climate of mutual respect for conflicting viewpoints. This is so different from the prevalent approach of cable news and social media of fomenting discord in order to boost ratings. Understanding and compromise have become dirty words in today's all-or-nothing politics. But it doesn't have to be so. SPY Chart Review: The SPDR S...00 ETF (SPY) closed 1Q2018 at 263.15, and then started Q2 with a thud on Monday before recovering some ground on Tuesday, closing at 260.73. However, I don't like to give too much credence to technical behavior on the first or last day of the quarter, given the manipulation and 'window dressing' commonly implemented by mutual funds. SPY closed the quarter right its 200-day simple moving average (around 259), and then lost support on Monday. But there was no confirmation of that lost support on Tuesday, as bulls returned to push up price just enough. Of concern, SPY has already made a 'lower high' versus its January high, and now the start of Q2 has given us the first 'lower low' that may be confirming an imminent downtrend. After successfully testing support at its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) in February and then stair-stepping its way back up, it found resistance at 280 and turned back down in ominous fashion, potentially in the process of forming a bearish descending triangle. A confirmed breakdown below the 200-day SMA would be undesirable, but a confirmed breakdown below double-bottom support at 253 would be quite bearish and suggest the beginning of a bigger correction. However, keep in mind that descending triangles sometimes turn out to be quite bullish, fueled by both dip buying and short covering. A confirmed breakout above the upper downtrend line would be quite bullish, taking price up to fill the gap at 270, at a minimum. Oscillators RSI, MACD, and Slow Stochastic all are pointing up from oversold territory and look poised to cycle further upwards.  Latest Sector Rankings:  Relative sector rankings are based on our proprietary SectorCast model, which builds a composite profile of each of over 600 equity ETFs based on bottom-up aggregate scoring of the constituent stocks. The Outlook Score employs a forward-looking, fundamentals-based multifactor algorithm considering forward valuation, historical and projected earnings growth, the dynamics of Wall Street analysts' consensus earnings estimates and recent revisions (up or down), quality and sustainability of reported earnings, and various return ratios. It helps us predict relative performance over the next 1-3 months. In addition, SectorCast computes a Bull Score and Bear Score for each ETF based on recent price behavior of the constituent stocks on particularly strong and weak market days. A high Bull score indicates that stocks within the ETF recently have tended toward relative outperformance when the market is strong, while a high Bear score indicates that stocks within the ETF have tended to hold up relatively well (i.e., safe havens) when the market is weak. Outlook score is forward-looking while Bull and Bear are backward-looking. As a group, these three scores can be helpful for positioning a portfolio for a given set of anticipated market conditions. Of course, each ETF holds a unique portfolio of stocks and position weights, so the sectors represented will score differently depending upon which set of ETFs is used. We use the iShares that represent the ten major U.S. business sectors: Financial (IYF), Technology (IYW), Industrial (IYJ), Healthcare (IYH), Consumer Goods (IYK), Consumer Services (IYC), Energy (IYE), Basic Materials (IYM), Telecommunications (IYZ), and Utilities (IDU). Whereas the Select Sector SPDRs only contain stocks from the S...00 large cap index, I prefer the iShares for their larger universe and broader diversity.  Here are some of my observations on this week's scores: 1. Basic Materials retains the top spot in the rankings with a strong Outlook score of 83. The sector continues to see solid sell-side analyst sentiment (net positive revisions to EPS estimates), a low forward P/E (15.2x, after a steep selloff related to tariff worries), good insider sentiment (net open market buying), and the highest return ratios. The forward PEG (ratio of forward P/E to forward EPS growth rate) is a favorable 1.25. Technology again takes the second spot with an Outlook score of 74, as it boasts the best sell-side analyst sentiment, the second highest projected year-over-year EPS growth rate (15.9%), a low forward PEG of 1.05, and strong return ratios. Financial comes in a distant third at 61, with a low forward P/E of 15.2x and a forward PEG of 1.11. Rounding out the top five are Healthcare and Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), all having Outlook scores above 50. Not surprisingly, most of the forward PEG ratios are much more attractive after the selloff, with the lowest (best) forward PEG going to Energy (0.53) and the highest (worst) going to Utilities (3.14). 2. Energy continues to sit at the bottom of the Outlook rankings with a score of 12 despite its strong projected year-over-year EPS growth rate of 36.9% and low forward PEG. Telecom has risen noticeably out of the bottom two, replaced by Consumer Services (Discretionary/Cyclical) with a score of 34. 3. Looking at the Bull scores, Technology enjoys the top score of 71, as stocks within this sector have displayed relative strength on strong market days, while Utilities scores the lowest at 46. The top-bottom spread is 25 points, which reflects low sector correlations on strong market days. It is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points, which indicates that investors have clear preferences in the market segments and stocks they want to hold (rather than broad risk-on behavior). 4. Looking at the Bear scores, we find Utilities at the top with a score of 64, which means that stocks within this defensive sector have been the preferred safe havens lately on weak market days. Technology has the lowest score of 40, as investors have fled during recent market weakness. The top-bottom spread is 24 points, which reflects low sector correlations on weak market days. Ideally, certain sectors will hold up relatively well while others are selling off (rather than broad risk-off behavior), so it is desirable in a healthy market to see low correlations reflected in a top-bottom spread of at least 20 points. 5. Technology displays the best all-around combination of Outlook/Bull/Bear scores, followed closely by Materials, while Energy is the worst. Looking at just the Bull/Bear combination, Technology is still the best, followed closely by Utilities, indicating superior relative performance (on average) in extreme market conditions (whether bullish or bearish), while Healthcare scores the worst, as investors have generally avoided the sector lately. However, Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical) seems to display the best balance between Bull and Bear scores, or the best all-round appeal. 6. This week's fundamentals-based Outlook rankings continue to reflect a bullish bias, given that the top four sectors are economically-sensitive, and all four score above 50. Keep in mind, the Outlook Rank does not include timing, momentum, or relative strength factors, but rather reflects the consensus fundamental expectations at a given point in time for individual stocks, aggregated by sector. ETF Trading Ideas: Our Sector Rotation model, which appropriately weights Outlook, Bull, and Bear scores in accordance with the overall market's prevailing trend (bullish, neutral, or defensive), displays a neutral bias and suggests holding Basic Materials (IYM), Technology (IYW), and Financial (IYF), in that order. (Note: In this model, we consider the bias to be neutral from a rules-based trend-following standpoint when SPY is between its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages.) Besides iShares' IYM, IYW, and IYF, other highly-ranked ETFs in our SectorCast model (which scores nearly 650 US-listed equity ETFs) from the Basic Materials, Technology, and Financial sectors include PowerShares DWA Basic Materials Momentum (PYZ), PowerShares Dynamic Semiconductors (PSI), and First Trust NASDAQ Bank ETF (FTXO). If you prefer a bullish bias, the Sector Rotation model suggests holding Technology, Basic Materials, and Financial, in that order. On the other hand, if you are more comfortable with a defensive stance on the market, the model suggests holding traditionally defensive sectors Utilities, Telecom, and Consumer Goods (Staples/Noncyclical), in that order. An assortment of other interesting ETFs that are scoring well in our latest rankings include Alpha Architect US Quantitative Value (QVAL), First Trust Materials AlphaDEX (FXZ), SPDR S...egional Banking (KRE), Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment (KNOW, which licenses and tracks a Sabrient index), Pacer US Cash Cows 100 (COWZ), iShares US Home Construction (ITB), John Hancock Multifactor Materials (JHMA), SPDR MFS Systematic Value Equity (SYV), and Elkhorn Lunt Low-Vol High-Beta Tactical (LVHB). IMPORTANT NOTE: I post this information periodically as a free look inside some of our institutional research and as a source of some trading ideas for your own further investigation. It is not intended to be traded directly as a rules-based strategy in a real money portfolio. I am simply showing what a sector rotation model might suggest if a given portfolio was due for a rebalance, and I do not update the information on a regular schedule or on technical triggers. There are many ways for a client to trade such a strategy, including monthly or quarterly rebalancing, perhaps with interim adjustments to the bullish/neutral/defensive bias when warranted, but not necessarily on the days that I happen to post this article. The enhanced strategy seeks higher returns by employing individual stocks (or stock options) that are also highly ranked, but this introduces greater risks and volatility. I do not track performance of the ideas mentioned here as a managed portfolio. Disclosure: The author has no positions in stocks or ETFs mentioned.
