Thank you so much, Rico with the very latest on that from our bureau in Singapore. European Union finance ministers are due to meet later today to try to thrash out plans for a digital tax on tech giants including Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Under a scheme outlined last year by the European Commission, large companies would pay a 3% tax on data sales, online marketplaces and targeted advertising. But any deal requires unanimous approval - and some EU member states are opposed to any levy, fearing a backlash from Washington. As a result, France has pressed ahead with its own 3% digital tax - which it hopes will bring in more than $550 million a year. And France isn't alone - Spain and Italy are looking at a tax at the same rate, while Germany and the UK are considering introducing a levy - but at different rates. I'm joined by tech entrepreneur Tommy Stadlen. To give us his take on this. Good morning, Tommy. We might find out later what the decision is on the part of EU finance ministers, but when it comes to how this is progressing, it is not good news, is it, for small and medium size tech companies? There is a big risk for the small and medium size companies. What we want to get to with a situation where big tech pays its fair share of tax. Everyone wants that. At the moment they're not. We need to achieve that in a way that does not drive down innovation and does not scare away big tech from either individual countries within Europe or Europe as a whole. That is the real risk. When it comes to Google, Amazon, Facebook, this 3% levy in France at the moment and other countries is small fry for them. They have the resources to see it through, deal with the bureaucracy, et cetera. But for smaller companies? A big issue. The real issue for smaller companies is if you don't eat them with the tax, if, for example, in front of you drive out the likes of Google and Facebook and Neiko elsewhere, it has a knock-on effect to the tech ecosystem. So I am investing, they rely on talent, they rely on know how from the bigger companies to feed into the start-ups. It has knock-on effect that EU leaders might not be taking into consideration. From your perspective, an EU wide decision, a tax would be the best decision, rather than different countries making their own rules? The best would be a -- and OECD wide tax agreement. That is possibly fanciful thinking... That would be the best. EU wide second-best. What we want to avoid is the likes of the UK or France going out on their own and then potentially losing technology talents, the UK with Brexit that is of Isla the last thing we can do. For as's decision, they have implanted there is already, they could drive out Google, Amazon, Facebook from Paris to in this -- for us's Ireland has been good at attracting big technology company to Ireland because of tax. It matters to technology companies. 500 million per year. It is not huge amounts for the likes of Google and Facebook. What we want to really risk is on a roll mood music which is driving technology away from Europe and we have got to attract as much as we can and getting those big tech companies to pay their fair share -- overall.

Elon Musk has hit back at US regulators over their contempt proceedings against the Tesla boss. Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier. Has The inventor of the world wide web has warned that global action is needed to tackle its \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future\". Speaking exclusively to the BBC on the 30th anniversary of the first proposal for the web Sir Tim Berners Lee said people realised how their data could be manipulated following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to see Sir Tim in the place where he created the web. What kind of document was it? Was it it? It was I word. Using some sort of a wordprocessor. 30 years ago a computer scientist near Geneva was thinking up a better way of sharing information. From Tim Berners-Lee's idea the world wide web was born. Today he is worried about what it has become, a vehicle for spreading hate and misinformation. I feel for most people out there in the street that the tipping point, to a certain extent, was the Cambridge Analytica moment. Because most people knew that Internet privacy was on the other people worried about. And then went the Cambridge analytical thing went down they realised that elections have been manipulated using data that they had contributed. Veitia blame for that? This person got all this data and he got it under the pretext he was going to use it for research purposes. Then he actually used it to manipulate an election. I think it was abused and used for another purpose. It is a clear breach. Are you optimistic that this can be sorted? Am I optimistic in general? I think so.

That is possibly fanciful thinking... That would be the best. EU wide second-best.

Tommy, thank you for getting on so early for your take on that story. Get news from Brussels we will update you. Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Elon Musk has hit back at US regulators over their contempt proceedings against the Tesla boss. Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier. Has The inventor of the world wide web has warned that global action is needed to tackle its \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future\". Speaking exclusively to the BBC on the 30th anniversary of the first proposal for the web Sir Tim Berners Lee said people realised how their data could be manipulated following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to see Sir Tim in the place where he created the web. What kind of document was it? Was it it? It was I word. Using some sort of a wordprocessor. 30 years ago a computer scientist near Geneva was thinking up a better way of sharing information. From Tim Berners-Lee's idea the world wide web was born. Today he is worried about what it has become, a vehicle for spreading hate and misinformation. I feel for most people out there in the street that the tipping point, to a certain extent, was the Cambridge Analytica moment. Because most people knew that Internet privacy was on the other people worried about. And then went the Cambridge analytical thing went down they realised that elections have been manipulated using data that they had contributed. Veitia blame for that? This person got all this data and he got it under the pretext he was going to use it for research purposes. Then he actually used it to manipulate an election. I think it was abused and used for another purpose. It is a clear breach. Are you optimistic that this can be sorted? Am I optimistic in general? I think so. We have a new generation of young people, also, who are pretty active, they are pretty activist about things like their privacy. Whereas, to a certain extent, they were not before. That is Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But is quickly show you the financial markets. Stocks in Asia growing. The pound has jumped on what is seen by some in markets as a Brexit breakthrough. The pound heading for its biggest two day gain since November.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1NE-57a49ec32e164235892c60b83bed5114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1NE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-MRC1-JBH6-C4WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Elon Musk has hit back at US regulators over their contempt proceedings against the Tesla boss. Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier.

Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier.

Tommy, thank you for getting on so early for your take on that story. Get news from Brussels we will update you. Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Elon Musk has hit back at US regulators over their contempt proceedings against the Tesla boss. Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier. Has The inventor of the world wide web has warned that global action is needed to tackle its \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future\". Speaking exclusively to the BBC on the 30th anniversary of the first proposal for the web Sir Tim Berners Lee said people realised how their data could be manipulated following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to see Sir Tim in the place where he created the web. What kind of document was it? Was it it? It was I word. Using some sort of a wordprocessor. 30 years ago a computer scientist near Geneva was thinking up a better way of sharing information. From Tim Berners-Lee's idea the world wide web was born. Today he is worried about what it has become, a vehicle for spreading hate and misinformation. I feel for most people out there in the street that the tipping point, to a certain extent, was the Cambridge Analytica moment. Because most people knew that Internet privacy was on the other people worried about. And then went the Cambridge analytical thing went down they realised that elections have been manipulated using data that they had contributed. Veitia blame for that? This person got all this data and he got it under the pretext he was going to use it for research purposes. Then he actually used it to manipulate an election. I think it was abused and used for another purpose. It is a clear breach. Are you optimistic that this can be sorted? Am I optimistic in general? I think so. We have a new generation of young people, also, who are pretty active, they are pretty activist about things like their privacy. Whereas, to a certain extent, they were not before. That is Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But is quickly show you the financial markets. Stocks in Asia growing. The pound has jumped on what is seen by some in markets as a Brexit breakthrough. The pound heading for its biggest two day gain since November.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WE-ce07045011264c77b14ada85c0cdf76e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-MRC1-JBH6-C4WY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402026</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It has knock-on effect that EU leaders might not be taking into consideration. From your perspective, an EU wide decision, a tax would be the best decision, rather than different countries making their own rules? The best would be a -- and OECD wide tax agreement. That is possibly fanciful thinking... That would be the best. EU wide second-best. What we want to avoid is the likes of the UK or France going out on their own and then potentially losing technology talents, the UK with Brexit that is of Isla the last thing we can do. For as's decision, they have implanted there is already, they could drive out Google, Amazon, Facebook from Paris to in this -- for us's Ireland has been good at attracting big technology company to Ireland because of tax. It matters to technology companies. 500 million per year. It is not huge amounts for the likes of Google and Facebook. What we want to really risk is on a roll mood music which is driving technology away from Europe and we have got to attract as much as we can and getting those big tech companies to pay their fair share -- overall. Tommy, thank you for getting on so early for your take on that story. Get news from Brussels we will update you. Now let's brief you on some other business stories. Elon Musk has hit back at US regulators over their contempt proceedings against the Tesla boss. Lawyers for Mr Musk say his recent tweet - claiming that the electric carmaker would produce around half a million vehicles this year - complied with Tesla's communication policy for senior executives. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said the tweet was in breach of a deal under which Mr Musk requires prior approval before sharing company information on social media. French prosecutors are reported to have launched a preliminary inquiry into how former Renault chief Carlos Ghosn financed his 2016 wedding party at the Palace of Versailles. The French carmaker last month said an internal probe had found evidence that it had footed some of the bill but the chateau had waived the usual $56,000 fee under a sponsorship deal signed a few months earlier. Has The inventor of the world wide web has warned that global action is needed to tackle its \"downward plunge to a dysfunctional future\". Speaking exclusively to the BBC on the 30th anniversary of the first proposal for the web Sir Tim Berners Lee said people realised how their data could be manipulated following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones went to see Sir Tim in the place where he created the web. What kind of document was it? Was it it? It was I word. Using some sort of a wordprocessor. 30 years ago a computer scientist near Geneva was thinking up a better way of sharing information. From Tim Berners-Lee's idea the world wide web was born. Today he is worried about what it has become, a vehicle for spreading hate and misinformation. I feel for most people out there in the street that the tipping point, to a certain extent, was the Cambridge Analytica moment. Because most people knew that Internet privacy was on the other people worried about. And then went the Cambridge analytical thing went down they realised that elections have been manipulated using data that they had contributed. Veitia blame for that? This person got all this data and he got it under the pretext he was going to use it for research purposes. Then he actually used it to manipulate an election. I think it was abused and used for another purpose. It is a clear breach. Are you optimistic that this can be sorted? Am I optimistic in general? I think so. We have a new generation of young people, also, who are pretty active, they are pretty activist about things like their privacy. Whereas, to a certain extent, they were not before. That is Sir Tim Berners-Lee. But is quickly show you the financial markets. Stocks in Asia growing. The pound has jumped on what is seen by some in markets as a Brexit breakthrough. The pound heading for its biggest two day gain since November.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1SE-15e4d6afa52b4c5087ef88b7bd0ec367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1SE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-MRC1-JBH6-C4V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, at a hearing to examine how the innovation economy leads to growth:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Chairman Paulsen, Senator Heinrich, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss innovation and economic growth. It is an honor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ECONOMIC GROWTH IS CRITICAL</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Economic growth drives increases in living standards and improves quality of life. A simple examination of the fruits of economic growth over the past two centuries -- dramatic reductions in child mortality rates and poverty rates, significant increases in leisure time, longer lifespans, access to modern education and medical care -- demonstrates what growth can do for individuals and societies. It has been discouraging to see some downplay the importance of economic growth in the public square. Imagine if our forefathers had done the same. Public policy is rightly concerned with increasing the rate of economic growth. Indeed, it should be among Congress' top concerns.</p><p>HOW ECONOMIES GROW</p><p>\"Economic output is a function of economic inputs. The growth rate of output, therefore, is determined by how quickly capital and labor grow, along with technology and the skill and knowledge with which factors of production are employed. Especially over longer time horizons, the most important driver of growth is innovation. And fundamentally, innovation is driven by letting loose the creative power of individuals to invent new and better ways of producing goods and services and, of course, new goods and services themselves.</p><p>FOSTERING INNOVATION</p><p>\"How can Congress foster innovation? One important way is to improve the skills of workers, helping to enable individuals to innovate. Education reform designed to teach twenty-first century skills is critical. A stronger emphasis on work-based learning for workers with high school degrees is critical. And, in my view, increasing the number of highly skilled immigrants allowed to live and work in the United States is critical as well. Immigrants start businesses at a higher rate than native-born workers.1 Perhaps more importantly, businesses in science and technology industries are disproportionately likely to be founded by an immigrant.2 Many of the most innovative companies in the United States were founded by immigrants.</p><p>\"Government has a role to play in supporting the basic research that innovation requires. Two important ways government supports innovation are through funding basic research and producing the economic and social statistics required by businesses, researchers, and policymakers. It is critical that Congress not step back from these responsibilities.</p><p>\"Beyond encouraging innovation through increasing skills and supporting basic research, there is a wide variety of actions government can take. Avoiding excessively high tax rates, reducing regulation and other barriers to technological progress, and maintaining a posture of openness to the rest of the world through international trade are just some of the ways public policy can support innovation.</p><p>THREATS TO INNOVATION</p><p>\"Congress can also foster innovation by helping to create and enforce an appropriate regulatory environment. Likewise, imprudent regulation can stifle innovation, slowing economic growth and the rate of improvement of living standards.</p><p>\"I have been quite concerned about imprudent regulation recently in the conversation around \"Big Tech.\" It has been common to hear calls from both the political left and right to break up major technology firms using the government's antitrust powers.</p><p>\"In my view, such action would be a major policy mistake.</p><p>\"For the past half century the federal government has followed the best standard that experts have crafted to identify anticompetitive behavior: consumer welfare. More specifically, when deciding whether a firm is hurting competition, the following questions should be asked: Is the company reducing the welfare of consumers by pushing up the prices consumers face, and/or by reducing the quality and variety of products and services consumers enjoy?</p><p>\"This antitrust standard stands in contrast to a different view, which rests on the presumption that large and powerful companies should be suspect because of their size, under the assumption that with size comes undue economic power and a lack of competition.</p><p>\"I would highlight three primary reasons why latter view is inferior to the consumer welfare standard. First, it is much more vague and harder to define. This vagueness invites regulatory mischief at worst. More than that, though, is the concern that due to its vagueness regulators might be swayed more by the public debate around a particular company than by relatively more objective metrics (keeping in mind that there is always a large subjective element to determinations under any standard).</p><p>\"Second, the view that is suspicious of size ignores the good things that come from size. Economies of scale allow companies to produce goods and services more efficiently, at a lower cost, than relatively smaller firms. These efficiencies can take many forms, including more specialized management and production techniques.</p><p>\"Third, focusing on size distracts regulatory attention from consumers. This argument is circular. It is equivalent to asserting that consumer welfare should be the regulatory goal in a normative sense.</p><p>\"Big Tech has significantly increased consumer welfare. Consider prices. Many products are offered to consumers free of charge. For example, Google searches, Gmail, Google-hosted websites, Facebook accounts, and Twitter accounts are all free. Amazon does not sell its products at a price of zero, but it has significantly reduced the prices faced by consumers for many products. Some even argue that Amazon is reducing the rate of consumer price inflation for the overall economy.3</p><p>\"Now consider product quality and innovation. The services mentioned above are remarkably innovative. In addition to them, for example, Apple first put an entire music library into the palm of our hands and then put a computer in all our pockets.</p><p>\"While it is very clear that Big Tech is advancing innovation and consumer welfare today, it is reasonable for regulators to ask whether its actions today might stifle innovation and consumer welfare in the future. In my view, there is little evidence to support this concern. Major technology companies spend significant sums of money on research and development for new products--i.e., on fostering innovation. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, spends sixteen percent of revenue on R&amp;D. Facebook spends twenty-one percent. Microsoft spends fourteen percent. These ratios are far higher than for other companies. For example, General Motors, General Electric, Procter and Gamble, and AT&amp;T each spend less than five percent of revenue on R&amp;D.4</p><p>\"The argument that Big Tech is a threat to innovation and consumer welfare in the future must also contend with the amount of churn in the technology industry. It was not long ago that the dominant web browser was Netscape, not Google; the dominant email service was not Gmail; and America Online was the dominant ISP. It is imprudent to assume that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and other tech giants will be dominant in perpetuity.</p><p>\"The public conversation also seems to misrepresent the actual dominance of these companies in the present day. For example, despite the concern about Amazon's dominance, online sales represent less than ten percent of total retail sales.5 Walmart's revenue is more than twice that of Amazon's.6</p><p>\"In summary, I do not view Big Tech as a threat to consumer welfare or innovation, and I am not convinced by arguments that antitrust action is required to advance those goals. Instead, Big Tech is advancing consumer welfare through offering consumers a wide variety of high-quality products at low (and sometimes zero) prices. In addition, Big Tech is advancing consumer welfare and innovation in the future through high amounts of spending on research and development, which will fuel innovation for the future.</p><p>\"And the innovation created by Big Tech will fuel faster economic growth and higher living standards for American families.</p><p>CULTURE</p><p>\"I will close with brief remarks on the importance of culture. Social attitudes that value hard work and openness to new ways of doing things are critical for fostering innovation, growing the economy, and increasing living standards. The same is true for social capital, which affects trust and cooperation both in and out of economic life. Politics and policy are largely downstream from culture, but it is an overstatement to argue that they don't affect culture. Where innovation comes from is largely a mystery. But a hypothesis worth taking seriously is the intersection of strong institutions and a culture that supports risk taking, skill accumulation, hard work, and creativity. Many public policy decisions in a wide array of domains subtly and indirectly affect these values and dispositions. The total effect of those decisions might be significant.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Footnotes:</p><p>1 Immigrants are more than twice as likely as those born in America to start a business; see Robert Fairlie. \"Open</p><p>for Business: How Immigrants Are Driving Small Business Creation in the United States,\" The Partnership for a</p><p>New American Economy, August 2012.</p><p>2 One fourth of all technology and engineering companies had at least one immigrant cofounder between 2006 and</p><p>2012; see \"The Economic Case for Welcoming Immigrant Entrepreneurs,\" Entrepreneurship Digest, Ewing Marion</p><p>Kauffman Foundation, September 2015.</p><p>3 This is often referred to as the \"Amazon effect.\" See, for example, Mark Whitehouse, \"Amazon Might Help Explain the Inflation Mystery,\" Bloomberg View, 16 October 2017.

Welcome back.   Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo right  here in D.C.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump will address a joint session of  congress tonight for the first time as commander-in-chief.  The president  is expected to stress unity during his speech, however before taking the  stage the president blamed his predecessor for tensions in the country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that President Obama  is behind it because his people are certainly behind it.  And some of the  leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks which are  really very serious leaks because they're very bad in terms of national  security.  But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him  being behind things, that's politics, and it will probably continue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's speech tonight, the address begins at 9:00 pm Eastern and we  will be there live with analysis for you right after.  A miraculous story  of survival, a small plane crashes into a home killing three people but a  cheerleader onboard is alive this morning.  The details coming up.  Target  shares sinking in premarket this morning, the retail admits expectations on  both revenue and earnings.</p><p>The stock is plummeting down 13 percent, we will break down the numbers  coming up.  And Oh Snap, the parent company of Snapchat expected debut on  Wall Street Thursday.  What you need to know ahead of the highly  anticipated IPO in environment where we haven't seen a lot of IPOs.   Meanwhile, it could be a record day on Wall Street today.  Take a look at  futures indicating a flat opening this morning, this has been the situation  every morning and yet at the end of the day we see another record-high  close.  Another gain today would be a 13th record close in a row that is  never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are searching for direction, take a look at  Eurozone indices with the FT 100 up just a fraction in the CAC Quarante.   And the DAX Index lower.  And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a  look, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the weakest link down 3/4 of 1  percent.  Well, a tweet maybe to blame for the for biggest mistake in Oscar  history  Plus the best picture snafu not only thing plaguing the years'  award shows.  The details after Hollywood's big night delivers a ratings  bomb.</p><p>All of those stories coming up.  And joining me this morning to talk all  about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's  global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Fox News Contributor, Rachel  Campos-Duffy.  Good to see you.</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show so far you guys.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.  A lot of  excitement building up before the president gives his second big speech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've been great in terms of really outlining what's  important tonight.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  More spending on military, more spending on  infrastructure, less spending on domestic programs and importantly, the  state department outreach to rest of the world, America first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?  You're absolutely right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And don't forget, we're going to all be  looking to see what Melania Trump is wearing tonight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's important.  That's important. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also that President Trump is not going to touch Medicare or  Social Security which was something that he said on the campaign trail but  to people worried about the national debt and the looming tidal wave of the  tsunami of the entitlement programs.  I think that that's of note and of  concern.  And by the way, I still want to point out that if this president  and this congress gets bogged down in the repeal and replace of Obamacare  and you start getting toward the end of 2017, with a tax reform, that's  going to be not good news for the markets.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's why, you know, we're talking about the market  potentially a record 13th straight day of increases is -- at some point the  market is going to stay -- is going to ask is it delivering, are we -- are  we getting what he -- what he promised?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And a lot of hangs in the balance.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about that this morning. Joining the  conversation, former chief of staff under President Clinton, Mack McLarty  is with us this morning.  President George W. Bush's former undersecretary  of defense for policy, Doug Feith is with us and the host of Varney and  Company, Stuart Varney will weigh in as well.  We got a big program ahead.   So just stay with us for this hour.  We kick it off right now with our top  story and that is the president set to outline this is agenda tonight on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  During his  address to a joint session of congress tonight.  Peter Barnes is live at  the White House right now with the details.  Peter, good morning to you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning,  Maria.  That's right.  We got more details from the president aides about  tonight's speech, they say the president will talk about his  accomplishments during his first month or so here in office including those  executive orders and possibly talks about companies, about keeping and  creating jobs in the United States, he will also discuss that range of  issues that you just mentioned.  And maybe he'll take a little credit for  the stock market and those recent records he did on Fox and Fiends this  morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  You take a look at what's going on with the stock market, trillions  of dollars of value have been created since I won election, I mean  trillions, and -- in fact it was very interesting on Friday, it looked like  for the first time in 11 or 12 sessions the market might go down a little  bit and it was down, down, down, it was like 15 seconds left and all of a  sudden it shut up.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Now, the big initiative he'll discuss tonight of course is his  plan to ask congress for $54 billion in additional spending on defense, his  aides say that the 10 percent increase, defense stocks have been up on that  news and administration official also saying the broad theme of the speech  tonight is the renewal of the American spirit and an optimistic vision for  all Americans, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you so much.  Peter Barnes with the  latest there.  I want to bring in Mack McLarty right now, he is former  chief of staff under President Clinton.  Mack it's good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p>MACK MCLARTY, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Maria, always  good to be with you.  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to hear from the President tonight.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  I'd like to hear really, first, the concrete outline of what he's  going to do, I think the speech will be more positive.  I think he will  call for unity, how that proceeds, we'll have to wait and see.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what -- let me -- look, we know roughly speaking that he  wants to increase military spending, we know that roughly speaking he wants  to come out with a tax plan and repeal and replace Obamacare, are you  onboard with those initiatives? </p><p>MCLARTY:  Not totally.  I think he will lay out his framework, you know,  the president proposes the congress disposes, and so he will lay out his  framework, it will work its way through the congress and the various  committees.  I think there's already been concern expressed about the very  substantial increase in the military budget.  We all want to support our  troops, we've had 15 years of war, equipment been depleted, there's no  question.</p><p>On the other hand is someone who had the privilege to work with president,  who did balance the budget.  I am concerned about the budget and the impact  there and you even have the military speaking about not weakening the state  department.  It's essentially we have soft diplomacy and engagement as well  as strong military power.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can we talk about the White House, you ran a White House,  there is a lot of different factions in this White House, we have -- we  have budget hawks, we have the populous wing of Bannon, we have  nationalists, what is your read of how this -- how this White House is  operating and the factions there, is it any different than anything you --  that you saw when you running the White House?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, lift-offs are always a challenge in any White House and  President Trump came from outside, Governor Clinton came from being a  governor.  After 12 years the republicans being in office, but I think  Reince Priebus is capable, first, he knows Washington, there are always  power senators in Washington.  This is not unique to Trump administration  but they need to prioritize and get a handle on what they're doing and move  forward with their plan not unlike what Maria just outlined on the speech  and this is a  good evening to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are they all in line do you think?  I mean, when you look  at what the priorities are from counselors around him to his Chief of Staff  Reince Priebus?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, Maria, a couple of points.  I think you want different  points of view in any White House, any president wants different or CEOs or  whatever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want yes men around.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  But the -- but the challenge for Chief Priebus is to be an honest  broker, and it's the same thing with the national security advisor to take  those different views, put them in a form that gives the president the  option to making decision and then close on a decision.  That's what  important in any platform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How will the democrats going to treat -- </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, we were talking about that earlier, I hope carefully and  nimbly, I mean, if he calls for more jobs, do you stand and applaud for  that or not?  And so it's going to be tricky for them, I think they need to  pick their disagreements so to speak very carefully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you make a great point and it's a good question  because tonight we know that there will be protesters outside.  Tonight we  know that there will be guests of certain democrats who may actually, you  know, resist what the president's policies are.  How should President Trump  handle that?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, he's had some practice at handling it during the campaign.   And it could play in his favour.  I hope though tonight, not to be  pollyannaish but I hope deny, I mean, it's a serious address about serious  issues.  It's a call for unity, it's a very serious thoughtful speech and  it's received in that manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think there are some dangers for the democrats in this, I  mean, some of the guests that they've invited are people we would expect  but there is talk that they may have given some of these extra tickets to  protesters who may jump up and we saw the reaction that, you know, when Joe  Wilson said, you lie, you know, I mean, people do expect the sense of  decorum and respect for the office of president and should something happen  that's very disruptive or disrespectful, you know, we see the numbers for  the -- whole numbers saying that the country is moving -- saying that we're  moving in the right direction, what happens to democrats if they just look  like the party of resistance of disruption, and just really trying to put a  stop to him even just getting off the ground and even with -- Barack Obama  looking like he's beating this maybe from a few miles away.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  I would take a little exception to your final point but I think  your other points were appropriately made and if you look at the  democratically governors, association and their comments, they made very  much -- as very much the same thing that you just echoed, we've got to be  for something else as democrats.  We got to before a growth agenda, how are  we going to get this economy moving that includes everybody.  So they just  can't be against President Trump.  They need to pick and pick their battles  very carefully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do they have that?  I mean, is there something that they're  for other than being against Donald Trump?</p><p>MCLARTY:  Oh, I think you're seeing that emerge, Maria.  And I think it's  frankly, early in Trump administration and early in terms of the democrats  getting all of their programs together and moving forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said -- you said you take issue with what Rachel just said.   I want to play you a sound bite from President Trump and he basically says  no, President Obama is behind some of this.  Listen to this.</p><p>MCLARTY:  OK.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it, I also think it's politics, that's the  way it is and look I have a -- </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  But bush wasn't going  after Clinton, Clinton wasn't going after bush.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes,  you know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  You  know, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people is  certainly are behind it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  is it -- is it a stretch to say that his people are behind the  protesters and loyalists to President Obama?</p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, I think there is some natural disagreement from people that  supported President Obama or perhaps when President Obama's administration.   I think President Trump said you never know is probably the key phrase but  to say I think and suggest that President Obama is personally engaged, I  don't think there is any real evidence to suggest that's the case. </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's definitely encouraged it through statements that he  made and I would say that it's -- I don't think we should normalize a  president -- an ex-president not really sort of giving the new president a  chance to -- I mean this is a highly unusual the level of involvement and I  mean, most presidents sort of recede into background.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, President Bush certainly did and President Clinton did  although President Trump has been pretty critical of President Obama, so in  this counter punching narrative that President Trump has put forward, you  could -- you could say that but I don't expect President Obama to be  actively engaged.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tonight, it will be a success if? </p><p>MCLARTY:  If one --it's a positive speech as kind of -- as of kind of a  Ronald Reaganess or Bill Clintoness, positive view, let's move forward  together and it has some specific and it -- that at least have some  possibility for common ground of bipartisan support.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Mack, good to see you.</p><p>MCLARTY:  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Mack McLarty there, Fox  Business is taking you live to the president's joint address to congress  tonight 9:00 pm Eastern, so stay with us as we have a full coverage  tonight.</p><p>Coming up.  We will Snapchat and will company have a picture-perfect debut  on Wall Street, new details on Snap's hotly anticipated IPO.  Target stocks  sinking in the premarket down 13 percent after disappointing fourth  quarter, a closer look at the company's earnings.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane crashing into two houses in  Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So, Maria fire officials say one  teenager was thrown from a backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl  only had minor injuries.  Three people were killed when the aircraft  crashed shortly after taking off from Riverside Municipal Airport.  The  cell phone video caught the moment of the crash, you can see huge flames  and thick smoke following that explosion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the backhouse of the neighbors, they're exiting an elderly man,  exiting firefighters were taking people to safety.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on that plane.   They were flying home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  </p><p>Well, analysts at UBS say the Costco may boost their membership fee in the  next few months.  UBS putting out a note to investors saying the warehouse  chain fees for basic membership likely going to increase by $5 that means  it will be $60.  UBS is the fee for a Costco executive membership going to  rise by 10, they will make it 120 every year.  It affirms that Costco might  announce those hikes on Thursday when they release a second quarter  earnings.</p><p>Costco recently did increase their membership fees by 10 percent in other  countries, they did it in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico even the U.K.   Costco has not confirmed it but during an earnings call in December, the  CEO said the time might be actually ripe for that fee hike, so we'll see on  Thursday.  Well, President Donald Trump preparing to address a joint  session of congress for the first time tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming up.  We have to  understand Obamacare has been a disaster.  It's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border and remember  this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting the bad ones  out, the bad people.  Gang members, druglords, and some cases murderers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And the president also we should say expected to declare early  progress on his campaign promises.  Well, let's take a look at Target  shares, they're being hit pretty hard this morning guys.  The company  reported sales and earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.  Target  was hurt by a disappointing holiday quarter, we talking about it this  morning.  There is the stock.  Earnings came in buck 45 a share, they  missed the estimate 1.51, they also said the outlook for fiscal year 2017  is also, Maria, going to miss analysts expectation.  So it was about the  holiday quarter certainly the retailers under pressure because of folks  like Amazon.  And those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure that's it.  Tough quarter for Target.  Thank you  so much, Cheryl.  And we are back with our panel, Dagen McDowell, Jon  Hilsenrath, Rachel Campos-Duffy.  Tonight, the big night.  First time we'll  hear from the president since inauguration day, Rachel.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Absolutely.  And, you know, this is the prime time address.   It's not in the middle of the day, expect huge ratings, expect them to talk  about these ratings especially with -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  God, you're right.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  -- the Oscar ratings down, I think he's going to take a lot  of pleasure in seeing his own ratings going up.  This guy knows how to do a  show, he's very unpredictable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think it's going to be very interesting, I know I  mentioned Melania and Ivanka in what they're going to wear, listen, this is  a huge rebound of the image for the republican party, highly fashionable  women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think -- I think it's -- I think this is the real moment  for the republicans.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's two things on that we're looking at.  One is, there's  going to be so much attention in who's in the gallery above all these  dignitaries down on the floor.  So much talk about who the democrats are  inviting, who republicans are inviting.  I think we're going to hear more  about that that than we usually do.  That's one thing.  The other thing,  something we've been talking about all morning, Maria is immigration, what  is the president's stand on immigration.  You've been distinguishing -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We know where it stands on immigration.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, no.  But this is -- but this is the important point  between legal and illegal immigration.  If we're going to hit growth  targets of three percent or more, we actually need more legal immigration  and not less of it because the population is aging and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- because we have all these baby boomers retiring.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  The barrier has always been the wall and that's what -- and  border security.  So, if you want immigration reform, you first have to  secure the border and I think that's something -- he's a populist because  that's actually very popular to secure our border and getting out violent  criminals and other very popular.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very popular.  Absolutely.  Dagen, I mean, look, we have been  talking about differentiating legal from illegal because in some of the  circles here, particularly the democrats bringing their guest tonight,  they're confusing it.  I mean, as if the president doesn't want legal  immigration.  I mean, has he said he doesn't want legal -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That -- this has been the opportunity for him to make that  distinction of the liberals and the democrats always talk about immigration  as a whole, that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about  securing the homeland period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  Still ahead President Trump seeks to  beef up the nation's military.  Meanwhile, the defense spending increase  expected in the White House as first fiscal budget.  That budget will be  out in the next week.  And then, the biggest technology IPOs since  Facebook.  Everything you need to know about Snap's hotly anticipated Wall  Street debut this week.  Back in a moment.  .  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Wall Street gears up for one of the biggest  intelligent IPOs in years, Snap, the parent company Snapchat however is not  expected to follow the same path as other social media giants that have  gone public like Facebook and Twitter.  Unlike other Silicon Valley giants,  Snap does not have a headquarters and its cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel is  an unconventional leader, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Jon  Hilsenrath here today, taking a look at it.  How will the Snap's IPO you  think be different than Facebook.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, our story today is all about the unusual  leadership of Snap CEO who is not a very open communicative person, doesn't  like to have big meetings with his -- with his staff.  So, I think there's  going to be some questions about management, how is -- how is management  going to run the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I tell you one thing that he got right, not to sell for  $3 billion back in the day, right?  Who offered $3 billion and then -- and  remember the -- oh, this is just crazy.  Why would you not sell?  You just  offered $3 billion and here he is with a $20 plus billion IPO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's engaged to Miranda Kerr, the actress who's Orlando  Bloom former homegirl if you will.  So there you go.  So we know that about  him, there might be a lose but he's got a model on his arm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it's a -- it's a big test for Wall Street because this  is our first big tech IPO in a while and, you know, we have to see if Wall  Street really embraces this like the Facebook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that's a great point because this is not a good IPO  period right now.  It is not a lot of I big deals.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It hasn't been but Wall Street is on fire now.  So if we get a  very hot IPO out of Snap and it could be something that adds a little  momentum.  </p><p>CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  I'll tell you who's embracing it, it is young people, I  mean, my teens are on, you know, they love this stock.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how loyal will they be two years from now, even two months  from now. </p><p>CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  They move on to another thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Look at this.  Is it -- is it Facebook or is it Twitter  is going to be big question --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to buy the IPO -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Rich Peterson, it has to be capitalized uses, looks as if  February 2017 will be the lowest monthly count of IPOs since March when --  of '16 when just four IPOs price.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And how o do you reconcile that with the fact that -- look at  -- look at the NASDAQ, look how high it is, you know, you would think in a  market like this that more companies will be coming out in IPOing, so if  you get a good one out of Snap then you might see some others following  behind it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wondered why because normally you want to go public when the  markets are rallying and when it's really strong performance and yet you're  just not seeing that.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And maybe it's a sign that this momentum we're  seeing in the market is not sustainable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we'll see, I mean, look, the markets are waiting for tax  reform, right, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we will be talking about this forever here, but we're up 13  percent since election day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And you've also seen the bonds rising along with stocks  which is unusual, so somebody is wrong in that equation, either gross loss  either or risky assets, you know, risk your assets.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We had a story in the paper just yesterday about how a better  reversal, we're starting to see people buying bonds again which is another  --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.  I said bonds rising.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Prices are rising, yields are falling which is a sign  that maybe people are starting to question the kind of growth that --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, I read the journal, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Oh, I know.  I know you do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she's been talking about that for some time as well.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, building a better defense,  President Trump's pledge to increase military spending.  Where the money  will come to from to pay for it.  And then a bigger buyout of Apple, why  Warren Buffet is doubling down on Apple shares.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, this morning in Washington.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump, set to  address the Joint Session of Congress tonight, for the first time since  taking office.  The Commander in Chief is expected to address many issues,  including taking care of our veterans.  Earlier in the program I spoke with  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, about his role so far. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  I've been in government now  about 18 months, that's long enough to understand how this system works and  where the problems are.  And my discussions with the President have been  that we have to make these changes quickly, and being able to know where  the problems are, is going to allow us to do that as quick as we need to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  address tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, join are us throughout the day today,  for full analysis as well.  As the President prepares to address Congress,  his Cabinet is one step closer to being complete.  The Senate confirming  Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, in a 72 to 27 vote last night.  He will  be sworn into office this morning.  Target shares are sinking in the pre- market, the retailer missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per  share.  We have breaking down numbers, coming up. </p><p>Warren Buffett, meanwhile, taking a big bite out of Apple: why the  billionaire invertor's betting big on Apple shares?  And it could be a  record day on Wall Street, Futures indicating: markets will open like this.   We are off of the highs and certainly, we're pretty flat to the -- to the  break-even line.  If we do see a record today, because this has been the  case open: we open lower, and then by the end of the day, close higher.   The gain would be a 13th record close, in a row, that has never happened in  the Dow's 120-year history.  </p><p>We're just getting breaking news right now; fourth quarter GDP is out.  The  fourth quarter grew at a rate of 1.9 percent, this is the second estimate;  this is below expectations.  The estimate calls for growth of 2.1 percent.   The GDP hitting the tape right now: markets, as you see, are reacting.  In  Europe, stocks are searching for direction this morning, take a look at  Eurozone indices and you will see fractional moves up in London and in  Paris, but even the DAX Index actually has turned positive.  The European  markets are actually, trading higher even if just by a fraction.  </p><p>And in Asia, overnight, markets were mixed, take a look, the big loser  there was the Hang Seng in Hong Kong: down three quarters of one percent.   Well, a picture of Kellyanne Conway, goes viral, but will the White House  take the criticism sitting down?  We'll talk about that picture, that's  going viral.  Plus, a tweet maybe to blame, a tweet for the biggest mistake  in Oscar history.  Why the man in charge, of the envelopes, may have been  more concerned with social media, and sending out tweets and pictures than  handing over the right envelope.  Our top story this half hour, President  Trump focusing on defense.  Trump is seeking a historic $54 billion  increase in defense spending, while pursuing cuts everywhere else.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  40 days, after his inauguration, President Trump and  Republican Congress will have -- not lifted a finger to create jobs, raise  wages for hardworking American families.  These actions will worsen the  conditions that fueled his candidacy, President Trump engaged in a bait and  -- a bait and switch agenda: no jobs, no retirement security, and no health  security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.  I just want to point out that he is seeking cuts  elsewhere, but not everywhere else, pardon me on that.  Joining us right  now is the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, under Bush 43,  Doug Feith is with us.  Under Secretary, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p>DOUG FEITH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE FOR POLICY UNDER SECRETARY UNDER GEORGE  W. BUSH:  Glad to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  So, the President says, he wants the U.S. to be  better prepared if called to fight.  What's your take on these expectations  that he wants to raise military spending by $54 billion? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, the defense budget was pretty severely slashed throughout the  Obama administration, and the Unites States continues to have large  worldwide defense responsibilities.  But we have not had a budget in recent  years that allow us to -- that allows us to actually, have the kind of  military capabilities that would allow to us fulfill responsibilities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want to see this?  You want to see more spending on  military then?  </p><p>FEITH:  I do.  I think it's an important thing, I think that we have large  parts of our infrastructure.  There -- recently, there've been some  attention paid to how our nuclear infrastructure for example, has  deteriorated greatly.  That's enormously dangerous, if countries around the  world that have depended on Unites States for decades, for their security  because of our nuclear umbrella?  Begin to worry about the integrity of our  nuclear umbrella, because we haven't been investing enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FEITH:  That's -- that makes for a much more dangerous world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure does.  Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration's proposal will take the defense budget  to $603 billion, that's still short of say, what a Senator John McCain  wants, which is closer to $640 billion.  Do you think that the Trump  administration should do even more, in terms of increasing the defense  spending?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, there're a lot of details to be debated, but I think that  what Senator McCain has said, Representative Thornberry has said in the  House, have to be taken seriously.  That there's going to be a debate  between mysterious people in Congress that are looking to pitch on the  Armed Services Committees in the House, and the Senate, and the  administration, and I think there is a strong argument to be made that the  administration has not gone far enough.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's going to be a debate within Trump administration  too because Mick Mulvaney, who's the Budget Director, has been kind of a  deficit hawk.  And that's one of the reasons that Senator McCain didn't  trickily care for.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Well, and I think that people are perfectly happy with  seeing us upgrade airplanes, and our ships, and armor for our troops, but a  lot of people see that there's some fat to be cut in the Pentagon.  And so,  maybe, sort of being, in between where Barack Obama was, and not quite  where John McCain wants him to be, means that, you know, military will have  to find ways where they can streamline in, and do things more efficiently,  so they can, you know, meet budget cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can he do that?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, it's -- this is a perennial question.  It's always a good  idea to cut fat.  I don't think that you're going to be able to solve the  problem simply by cutting the fat.  The amount of -- the serious harm that  was done, by the see quest ration cuts throughout the Obama years needs to  be remedied.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that.  I mean, go through for us the more  important areas of the military where you believe need love, frankly?  I  mean, we've got the oldest navy in decades, oldest army in decades, how you  characterize and assess where we we're today, and what needs to be done? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I mean, I think you flag some of the major issues, the our --  our navy needs more platforms, we need more capabilities in basically all  of the services.  We have -- we have for example, in Asia, had a policy  that at the beginning of the Bush administration we said, the real  strategic interests of the Unites States, require us to build up our  capabilities in Asia.  Some work was done in that regard.  Then President  Obama came in, and made the point about pivoting to Asia, which was a way  of essentially reaffirming, that we need to do more to focus on our  strategic interests in Asia, because Asia is both economically and  strategically enormously important.  In order to do what we need to do in  Asia, we need long range military capabilities, that's air capabilities,  naval capabilities, and the like.  All of that is enormously expensive and  requires us to build up our forces.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Donald Trump has said that he's -- he's asking these other  countries that have been benefiting from our military expenditures to step  up.  So, is that going to reduce some of the financial pressure on us? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I think that -- President Trump has said some things that I  think have some merit, and are also a problem.  </p><p>DUFFY:  OK.  </p><p>FEITH:  What he said that has merit is, what every American President in  basically since the cold war began, was saying, which is we would like  greater contributions from our allies.  That's another perennial debate.  </p><p>DUFFY:  But he seems to mean it, right?</p><p>FEITH:  Well, he has -- he has also said some things that I think were  really not constructive, and not accurate, about how some of our key allies  are free loaders.  I don't think that's a fair -- I don't think that's a  fair description.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you reassured by General Mattis, running the Defense  Department though?  Because he has gone against things that his boss,  President Trump has said, whether it's about torture, whether it's where  not taking Iraq's oil, whether it's standing by our NATO allies, does that  reassure you? </p><p>FEITH:  It does.  I think that General Mattis is understanding of the  importance of our alliances, is far more sound than the campaign rhetoric  that came from Mr. Trump, during the campaign, and even unfortunately some  of the things he said since he's been President.  But I hope that he -- I  hope that President Trump will take advice on what remains to be seen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has that comment about what you just said, free loaders?   How has that impacted our friends across the world?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I think -- I mean in my conversations with representatives  from a number of those countries, it has made them question whether  President Trump is going to continue to uphold the relationships, continue  to uphold the alliance obligations that we have.  And we -- I don't think  it is in our interests that we call those alliances into question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if -- what if some of them should be paying off, right?   How do get to do that? </p><p>FEITH:  As I said, it's been -- it has been a perennial problem that we've  encouraged and not always successfully, our allies to contribute more.  I  am happy to see that some of -- many of our allies are responding to Mr.  Trump by saying that they're going to increase their defense spending.   That's a positive thing, and I give -- I give President Trump credit for  that.  But, you know, this needs to be calibrated correctly to put the  pressure on the allies without making them question fundamentally, whether  we are going to remain true to our commitments.  </p><p>DUFFY:  It's definitely about that, but I can tell you that it really  resonates with the American people, when they hear Donald Trump tell them:  you have to care more about your liberty and freedom than we do.  And I  think that -- and Americans feel like, some of them are free loaders.  And  I don't know what a President can -- how do you strike that balance between  making them feel like, you know, we're not going -- we're not going to  leave you, that at the same time, putting enough pressure verbally on them.   At least, to get them to pay their fair share.  </p><p>FEITH:  You know, I see the -- I see the populist appeal of that kind of  rhetoric.  But I think it's very short sided because, what I am focused on,  is the interests of the American people.  It is not in our interests to  have our allies doubt our reliability.  That ultimately is not a way to  punish allies that you think are not contributing enough, we're going to be  punishing ourselves if we damage these alliances -- these alliances.  </p><p>And I really think that a responsible American official would be making  this clear to the American public.  These alliances, have kept the security  situation relatively quiet around a large part of the world, to be enormous  benefit of the American people.  It has created a platform on which an  enormous amount of economic growth has occurred, where trade occurs.  And  if we damage that general structure for security in the world, we are  damaging our own economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, of course.  Great to have your insights, Doug.  Thanks so  much.  We appreciate you joining us today.  Under Secretary, Doug Feith,  joining us.  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  Joint Address to Congress tonight.  Join us, for our special coverage all  day, and leading up to the address at 9:00 p.m. tonight.  And we'll be live  here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to have full analysis tomorrow morning.</p><p>Coming up next, markets setting new records under President Trump, but the  mainstream media is focused on the backlash against the President.  Stuart  Varney, sounds off, has some thoughts on that, he's coming up.  Plus, a  Kellyanne Conway photo not sitting well with some of her critics.  Why a  picture of the White House Adviser is going viral this morning.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are flat this morning although we are  expecting a couple of big movers.  Warren Buffett for example is taking a  bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stake in Apple is now  more than double what it was at the start of the year.  Berkshire now owns  133 million shares of Apple, it's up from 57 million.  It certainly made  money on that move.  Berkshire Hathaway stake is now about $18 billion.   Take a look at Apple shares right now at $137.05 a share in the premarket.</p><p>We're watching Amazon today.  Time Magazine reporting that the company is  working to give its voice assistance, Alexa, the ability to distinguish who  is talking to it.  The report says that the capability which is being  called Voice I.D., has been in development since 2015.  Amazon shares up  almost three percent this morning in the premarket. </p><p>Markets are poised for their 13th straight record breaking day.  But the  mainstream media seems to be giving the Trump rally the cold shoulder.  A  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, joins us from New York.  How do  you give this market the cold shoulder?  13 percent since Election Day, six  percent since the start of the year, Stu.  Wow.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\":  Yes.  And by the way, if we  close, just even one point higher today, it will be truly an historic event  on Wall Street because we've never seen 13 consecutive records in the 120- year history of the Dow Industrials.  Now, look at this, I've got the New  York Times.  I actually paid for a copy this morning, here it is.  It's not  on front page.  No mention of the Wall Street rally. The Trump rally, no  mention whatsoever on the front page.  So, I turned to the business  section.  It's called Business Day.  Not a single notion. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you kidding me? </p><p>VARNEY:  Not a mention.  You go to page B7, to find any mention of the  rally.  I'm looking for it -- fast here.  And it says, \"Wall street closes  at new highs again.\"  It's tucked down at the bottom corner of B7.  So  then, I splashed out big time, went to the Washington Post.  Here it is.   Not on the front page.  They do have an economy section on page eight.   Well what do you think the lead is in the Washington Post on this historic  day?  I will tell you, it is Apple shareholders all set to vote on whether  to force the company to make its leadership more diverse. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I rest my case.  If this is not the dishonest media.  You know, this is  total dishonesty. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's only $3 trillion in market wealth that has been created.   What do you want?  A whole story on it?  It's only $3 trillion.</p><p>VARNEY:  A trillion here, a trillion there.  Pretty soon, you're talking  big money.  You know what I mean, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  I think so.</p><p>VARNEY:  Look, if people are not watching Fox Business, Maria, Stuart and  everybody else, they wouldn't know that history is being made in our  economy, on our markets, they would not know it.  100 million people will  benefit directly from what we've seen on Wall Street, no mention.   Dishonesty. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Transparency is the issue.</p><p>VARNEY:  My rant is over, OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, no.  And there is the issue, you are not getting  the full story.  That's the point.  Stuart, thank you.  I know you have  more on this in about 10 minutes and we will see you then. </p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern.   Thank you. Stuart, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Coming up next, ruining the Oscars in 140 characters or less.  Why Twitter  may be to blame for the Best Picture mix-up at the Academy Awards. </p><p>Then, critics claiming that Kellyanne Conway is not putting her best foot  forward in the oval office.  The picture of the White House Adviser going  viral this morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, get this if.  If photo of White House  Adviser, Kellyanne Conway, is going viral this morning, there's the photo.   Social media erupted after the picture emerged of Conway with her feet on a  couch in the Oval Office.  Joining us right now is political analyst,  Kirsten Haglund, to talk more about this.  Kirsten, good to see you first  of all. </p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ADVISOR:  Good to see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us.  So, what do you think?  Are her critics  making a big deal out of nothing or does this bother you?</p><p>HAGLUND:  No, this is completely outrageous.  There is about 52,000 tweets  as of this morning about this particular incident.  You know what is just  sad is that it's such a really, really great meeting that's going on in the  Oval Office where that picture is being taken.  It's a meeting with  President Trump, as you can see, with leaders from historically black  colleges and universities.  It's just a really, really incredible thing and  they're shining the spotlight on something that really doesn't even matter.   And I should say, conservatives are quick to jump on President Obama when  he had photo taken of him in the Oval Office with a feet up on the desk or  his feet on the table next to couch.  This is political fodder, we expect  them to do.  But nothing's worse than what happened with Bill Clinton the  in oval office, so I think that people can give Kellyanne a break. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.  Do  we see that kind of reaction to the antics there with Bill Clinton and  Monica Lewinsky and then some?  But then again, Dagen, he put her feet on  the couch in the Oval Office.  How about some respect?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Momma McDowell would say, \"Don't put your feet on the  furniture.\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Particularly if it's the Oval Office.  The optics of this are  bad.  And President Trump understands optics better than anybody.  About --  I mean, he is a great showman that does not represent his administration  well.  I don't feel like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we know if she has her shoes on or is she walking around  there? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think if you're -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  I don't know if her shoes are on.  She's clearly trying to take a  better picture.  There are White House photographers there.  She didn't  need taking that picture, she certainly doesn't need it.  I -- listen, I  hate saying this, I'm a big Kellyanne fun, but I have kids, I would be  furious if they sat like that at the neighbor's house, let alone in the  Oval Office. </p><p>FEITH:  Either has her shoes on or her shoes are on the couch. </p><p>HAGLUND:  Which is bad. </p><p>FEITH:  Worse is walking around the Oval Office with no shoes on.  Which is  also -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  Which is bad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, there is a lot of people there, right?  I mean,  this is like an important meeting happening. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's the head of historic black colleges.  That makes it that  much worse, so -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  Listen -- </p><p>FEITH:  It's disrespectful to them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll cruise that both sides of the aisle.  And I don't think  that President Obama should have his feet on the desk and I don't think her  feet should be on this oval.</p><p>HAGLUND:  And I don't think my feet should also be in the Oval Office  either.  So, I think it's all bad. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's abridged, real far. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Totally agree.  What we want Kirsten, what about this.  We're  learning more about the big blunder, here around the world.  The wrong  movie awarded Best Picture at the Oscars.  So, here's what we know.  The  PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, he is to blame because just minutes  before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong envelope, he tweeted out  a photo of the Best Actress winner, Emma Stone, backstage.  </p><p>The award mix-up happened just three minutes later.  Now, Cullinan's  backstage tweets were reportedly not sanctioned by the Academy and he later  deleted the tweet along with other posts during the show.  So, what about  that Kirsten?  Do you think he deleted the tweets because he didn't want  people to think, \"You were focused on your tweets and you gave Warren  Beatty the wrong envelope,\" which is actually what happened.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Absolutely.  And I'm sure he didn't want PricewaterhouseCoopers  to find out as well.  You know, first I felt bad for this guy.  I thought,  \"Oh, don't publish his name.  Don't publish his photo.  He probably feels  awful already.\"  But then you see these pictures coming out and of course,  you know, you're backstage at a once in a lifetime opportunity, you want to  catch that shot and you want to post it but, you know, people get in  trouble with their posting.  </p><p>Do you know that in the last couple of years, there've been 127 deaths from  people trying to take selfies?  So, you know, we have to be really careful  with what we post, you know.  So, I mean, I originally felt bad for the guy  but you know, you're there to do your job.  You're paid to do one thing  right and look at what happened.  So, I don't think he'll be handing out  envelopes next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel bad for it because I know that when we're live on TV,  I'm over here and I want to get something that our guests said immediately  out.  I want to make sure my followers know what was just said on the show.   I tweeted out really quickly but the truth is, this is to make a big  mistake because you're focusing on too many things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's your show, though.  It's your show.  That one will show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  All right, Kirsten Haglund, good to see  you.  We'll be right back with the final thoughts from our All-Star panel,  right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks to our fantastic panel, see you all tomorrow everybody.   \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER:  40 days after his inauguration,  President Trump and the Republican congress will have not lifted a finger  to create jobs or raise wages for hard-working families.</p><p>These actions were worst than the conditions that fueled his candidacy.   President Trump engaged in a bait-and-switch agenda.

We are coming off of 12 straight record closes for the markets  and today could be a 13th.  Take a look at these markets.  We are looking  at fractional moves right now.

A gain today on the Dow Industrials would be a 13th record high  for this market which would break the record.</p><p>In Europe meanwhile, take a look at markets.  Stocks are searching for  direction this morning.  European indices up fractionally in London and  Paris but down fractionally in Germany.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, as you'll see here again, fractional  moves.

This is the second secretary to join  us this morning.  Earlier we heard of course from Treasury Secretary Steven  Mnuchin.  Today we will hear from V.A. Secretary David Shulkin.  Former  chief of staff under President George W. Bush and Business Roundtable  president and CEO Josh Bolten; this is a new role for Mr. Bolten, he will  tell us about it.

Members of the House and Senate will not be the only ones in attendance.   Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will  join first lady Melania Trump at the address.</p><p>Lawmakers are also allowed to bring guests to the President's address.   Some House Democrats are using the opportunity to bring dreamers and other  guests who would be affected by President Trump's immigration policies.</p><p>Joining me right now are Tennessee Congresswoman Marcia Blackburn and Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan.  It's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>REP. MARCIA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big night. First time we are hearing from the President  since inauguration day.  What do you make of what's happening in terms of  the guests, Congresswoman Blackburn?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Everyone has the opportunity to bring someone; usually get  someone from their district, ties in some way with policies and discussions  that are going on.  And I just hope everyone remembers they are there as a  guest of the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about you Congressman Ryan?  </p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  Oh, I think it's important to highlight, this has  been a tradition whether it's the President -- who the President invites,  who the first lady invites, who members of Congress invite.  We are  highlighting the fact that there will be hundreds of thousands if not  millions of people thrown off of their health care if there's a complete  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>And I think it's important to put faces to that policy issue and let people  look people in the eye and say, you're not going to be covered if we do a  straight repeal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we should point out that the President was very clear.   The President said that there's not going to be any interruption and people  will not lose their health care, actually.  That's what the President was  very clear about.  So I don't know -- </p><p>RYAN:  There was a Republican plan that was also put forward that said that  potentially millions of people were going to be thrown off.</p><p>Now, let's go back to the campaign where Trump campaigned at almost every  rally, Marcia and said we are going to rip it up, we're going to throw it  away, we're going to repeal this thing immediately.  He talked for a year  about doing that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not that he would throw anyone off the plan.  </p><p>RYAN:  Well, you can't do both.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Of course, you can do both.  </p><p>RYAN:  How?  What's the plan?  Tell us what the plan is.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  There is a way to go through this process and to make certain  that what we do is improve the options that are there.  And Tim, you know,  as well as I do, the goal is to make certain that everyone has access to  affordable health care.</p><p>Obamacare is imploding.  It's imploding and it is not affordable.  You can  look at the increase in the insurance rate.  You can talk to those that are  delivering health care and talk about the lack of reimbursement for the  care that is delivered.  And, Maria, the choice is, are you going to have a  system that implodes and have nothing?  Or are we going to fix this so that  there is access to affordable health care for all Americans.  That's the  choice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you attack this, Congressman, knowing that like in  places like Arizona we are seeing premium increases of 116 percent?   Families cannot afford this.  </p><p>RYAN:  Does it need tweak, fix?  I'm in.  Let's fix it.  There are  obviously issues with something this big, this comprehensive that will need  adjusted as we go, but the reality of it is when you talk about the  Medicaid expansion as John Kasich said on the weekend talk shows, the  governor of Ohio about how many hundreds of thousands of people -- about  700,000 in Ohio have benefited from the Medicaid expansion.  If you look at  the credits that are given to people to help them afford to be able to pay  for health care, those are essential elements of the health care.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying you don't want Obamacare touched?  Are you  saying you don't want Obamacare touched?</p><p>RYAN:  No, no, no.  I'm telling you we can fix it if there are undo premium  increases, if there are issues with competition.  How do we fix this?  Why  do we got to repeal it?  Why do you got to throw it out?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's too expensive it impacts economic growth.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>RYAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's dismiss that real quick.  The  Congressional Budget Office -- hold on.  The Congressional Budget Office  said -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, I'm not going to let you get by with that.  I'm not going  to let you get by with that.</p><p>RYAN:  This will actually be -- no, no, no.  This is an important point.   You can't let this go unanswered.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your point?</p><p>RYAN:  The point is that the Congressional Budget Office said in the first  10 years that the Affordable Care Act actually brings down the deficit by  $100 plus billion; in the second ten years it's over a trillion dollars of  deficit reduction on the health care. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think we should have a plan for 20 years and just wait  until it actually -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RYAN:  This isn't an either-or.  I don't know why it has to be an either- or.  We're all adults here.  Any other situation in your life is an either- or.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Here are the numbers.  If you have 22 million people in what is  the Obamacare realm, you have 11 million people, 12 million people that are  in the Medicaid expansion.  But then when you look at the exchange -- nine  million people, two million people can afford the product without a  subsidy, only two million people.  Seven million people can't afford it  unless they're getting a subsidy.  It is too expensive to afford.</p><p>Now, the other kicker in this is when people get it, you know, what they  say, we can't use it because the deductibles are so high, it's structurally  flawed.  It does not work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The deductibles are very (inaudible) that you're always  paying out of your pocket.  You could never actually reach that level.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  It turns out to be major medical.  </p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Can I just ask a quick  question?  So we saw some of the problems with Obamacare over the last four  years -- six years.  There were bills out to help fix some of these  problems.  Where were the Democrats in the fixes over the last five, six  years that the Republicans were putting forward?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good question.  </p><p>RYAN:  That's a very ironic question and the fact that they tried to do a  straight repeal.  How many votes?  60 something.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Some of those bills -- </p><p>RYAN:  And there was throughout the whole process of actually trying to put  it together, we got no cooperation from the Republicans at all.  We could  have very easily -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  60 percent of the people didn't want it.  60 percent of the  people didn't want it.  It was pretty clear the President basically went  around structures and pushed it through even though poll after poll showed  that people didn't want it.  </p><p>RYAN:  What structures.  It was the House and the Senate that voted on it.   All I'm saying is the Republicans fought this the entire way through.  If  we -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because their constituents didn't want it.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, they didn't even know what it was at that point.  And if they  were --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well Nancy Pelosi said let's pass it and then read it later.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  And then it gave the authority -- 1,400 times in that 2,300- page bill, it gives the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  Why did they do that?  Because they didn't want those items in  statute; they wanted to be able to go in and manipulate the system.  </p><p>RYAN:  Marcia -- that is such a misrepresentation of the process.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, it is not a misrepresentation.</p><p>RYAN:  There's nothing that we passed over here that we don't send to  executive branch and say you have to make rules for this.  You have to -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  1,400 times of rules -- that's one of the -- </p><p>RYAN:  It's the American healthcare system.  You guys try to simplify this  and you're doing a disservice to the American people.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is incorrect.</p><p>RYAN:  This is a complicated issue.  Sit at the table and be a part of the  solution.  And you guys -- </p><p>Blackburn:  And we just tried to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President didn't sit out at the table and try to be -- </p><p>RYAN:  He reached out to the Republicans through the entire process.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.</p><p>RYAN:  He couldn't get one Republican to sit and try to be a part of this. BARTIROMO:  You were there, did he reach out?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.  And then Energy and Commerce Committee,  Healthcare subcommittee where we did this, of course.  We have tried to  bring forward things that will improve the delivery of health care, that  will solve the problems whether it's reimbursement with CMS, whether it's  the 1115 waiver system.  And no, were we met with open arms from those on  the White House and the administration?  Absolutely not.</p><p>RYAN:  This is the biggest rewrite of history I've ever seen in my life.   The Republicans had no interest.  They used this as a political issue from  day one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, there was a reason -- with all due respect --  there was a reason Donald Trump won the presidency.  The American people  were frustrated.  And they were upset by what was going on in Washington.   They were upset by the executive orders.  It probably was as much about  Barack Obama as it was about Hillary Clinton.  Do you agree with that?   That's the reason Donald Trump won?  </p><p>RYAN:  Barack Obama had a jobs' bill at the Congress for years.  He kept  trying to work with Republicans.  Look, don't take my word for it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  His priority was health care.  He pushed health  care through.  </p><p>RYAN:  Let's provide context for the viewer.  Mitch McConnell said my sole  responsibility is to make Barack Obama a one-term president.  That was the  top Republican in the Senate.  And from that comment and the behavior of  the Republicans in the House not working with the President, not working  with Democrats saying we are going to use this opportunity that the people  have given us to shut Barack Obama down and the Democrats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that because -- </p><p>RYAN:  They weren't part of the process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he kept going around them, doing executive orders.</p><p>RYAN:  He went around them -- he went around them after that.  He went  around them after that after they showed no willingness to work.  And now  all of a sudden -- now all of a sudden every Republican in America -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY:  Now we are at the state of the Union, this joint session of  Congress we see this #Resist attitude coming, so are the Democrats going  look at what they perceive the Republicans did in terms of obstructing  Obama's agenda?  And are they going to say, we are going to do it  differently, we are going reach across the aisle, we're going to help the  country move forward for sure?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  What about that?</p><p>RYAN:  To be determined, I think.  Many of us including me, myself has said  from the very beginning, he's elected president, we should try to work with  him.  He did nothing in -- Maria, he campaigned on jobs, the economy, he  was going to open up the steel mills.  He was going to reopen the coal  mines and put people back to work.  Here we are, how many weeks later,  where is the trillion-dollar transportation bill? </p><p>Why would you pick -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With all due respect it's been a month.  It's been a month.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, within a month, the Obama -- within a month we had -- we had  the stimulus bill passed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you were in massive recession and it was like of urgent  need.  </p><p>RYAN:  Well, people in Youngstown voted for him because they are still in a  massive recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The point is though tonight a number Democrats are going to be  bringing legal immigrants here.  I don't understand why the grandstanding.   Why not go to the speech with your sleeves rolled up, ready to work, and  get the people's business done? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's the type of attitude that we would love to see.  </p><p>RYAN:  This is a complete reversal when President Obama was in, Marcia.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, it is not because -- </p><p>RYAN:  It's a complete reversal.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- there are so many times that we have brought good-solid  ideas to the table.  There are times, remember when -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows Harry Reid got in the middle of everything and  stopped any legislation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right, 400 bills.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows that.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  And what we are saying is, come on, guys, there're things that  are on the table.  We need to get these done.  Let's get them to the  President's desk.</p><p>It is time to get this country moving again.  The American people voted for  us.  That is s why Donald Trump is president.  So let's bring our best  efforts to bear.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The people want you guys to work together.  You know that.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, they do.</p><p>RYAN:  You're the President, you set the tone.  Pick the issues that you  know are going to unify the country.  Pick the transportation bill,  trillion dollars, Davis-Bacon, broadband in every corner of the country.   We want to see -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And military spending -- it looks like the public wants an  increase in military spending.  That's according to the polls.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, we do.  We do -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RYAN:  Let's do it, Marcia -- you and I should do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.</p><p>RYAN:  But I think we do need to rebuild the military. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Ryan and Congresswoman Blackburn -- thank you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We are live from our nation's capital for President Trump's  address to a joint session of Congress tonight.</p><p>It is a gorgeous sunrise behind me.  Take a look.  We are enjoying this  beautiful day here in Washington.</p><p>Meanwhile a top executive of Uber who recently joined the company from  Google has resigned. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and back story there.  Cheryl -- over to  you.</p><p>CASONE:  I've got the story, not the sunrise though here in New York City  like you've got, Maria.</p><p>So Amit Singhal resigned from Uber for not disclosing a sexual harassment  charge at his former employer that was first reported by Recode.  Singhal  denies he sexually harassed anyone while he was at Google where he was the  head of Search.  Uber has been dealing with charges of discriminatory and  sexist behavior at their company.  Singhal joined Uber in January from  Google and his senior (ph) role in maps and to advise on Uber's self- driving technology.</p><p>Well, speaking of self-driving Uber cars, the \"New York Times\" reporting  those cars missed at least six red lights and that had nothing to do with  human error, as Uber first said they did.  Problems with the mapping  program is to blame on that incident.</p><p>Well, careful what you say around your kids toys.  Hackers recently exposed  the conversations of nearly a million owners of Cloud Pets.  They make  those stuffed cats, dogs or rabbits for kids that you can use to talk to  your kids with.  Well, the animals are supposed to deliver messages that  you record via an app on your phone.  Well many of those recording ended up  in the hands of hackers as did passwords and e-mails.  Security experts say  it's warning the parents that have these pets to be aware of what they're  giving their children especially if they are using Cloud Pets, by the way.</p><p>Well, SpaceX wants to send humans into deep space; the company owned by  Elon Musk already delivers cargo to the space station for NASA.  Now they  hope to begin taking tourists around the moon within two years.  SpaceX  says it has already accepted a significant deposit from two unidentified  private citizens who want to fly around the moon.  The tourist flight would  last about a week and this would come after SpaceX begins (inaudible)  taking NASA astronauts up to the International Space Station and back.</p><p>Hope they enjoy that trip.  I will be watching from the ground -- Maria.   And those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much-- Cheryl.  </p><p>President Trump meeting with lawmakers and business leaders to jumpstart  his number one priority, the task of repealing and replacing Obamacare.   We'll take a look at that.</p><p>Plus what else is on the President's agenda for tonight's big speech.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, you are the big ones.   You are the biggest of the big -- right.  That's very impressive.  Thank  you for being here.</p><p>We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that  Obamacare has had and we are going the change it and straighten it out.   And we have a plan that's going to be, I think, fantastic.  It'll be  released fairly soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking during a meeting yesterday  with the CEO's of the country's largest health insurance.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former chief of staff under Bush 43 and the  president and CEO of the Business Roundtable -- Josh Bolten joining us now.   Josh -- good to see you.</p><p>JOSH BOLTEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First off, give us your expectations for the big speech tonight.  What  should President Trump be thinking in terms of what's most important as you  have seen this before being the chief of staff?  What do you think he's  going to be front and center and where he should focus?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Well, every state of the union or this is a quasi-state of the  union should give the President an opportunity to set priorities.  From the  standpoint of the business community and from the standpoint of the whole  U.S. economy, the most important thing the President can do is really get  the ball rolling on three key priorities -- tax reform, regulatory reform,  and investment in infrastructure.</p><p>There's a tremendous opportunity sitting right there for the Republican  Congress for the President.  This is the time to really get the momentum  going for those priorities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I agree with you.  Are you comfortable with the timing  that the President has laid out because so far we are looking at tax reform  now really having a bigger impact in 2018 as opposed to this year?</p><p>We had Steven Mnuchin on this program yesterday who was very clear that we  are not going see a real plan probably until the summer time, August.  </p><p>BOLTEN:  You know, we would like to see it move as fast as possible.   Secretary Mnuchin is right that it's going to be hard to have a plan  actually implemented before 2018.  But the whole business community would  like to see tax reform done as rapidly as possible in 2017.  But they've  got a lot on their plate.  They need to work it through</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of an impact do you expect tax reform to have on  economic growth?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  If it's a good tax reform and by good I mean a tax reform that  substantially lowers corporate rates to an internationally competitive  level and a tax reform that shifts us toward a territorial system of  taxation.  If it's that kind of tax reform, it'll have a huge impact on the  economy.  It's an enormous opportunity because we have kept our economy  shackled by a way outdated tax system.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that but shackled by an enormous amount of regulation.   So you've got this rollback of regulation happening alongside the tax  reform.  How important is that?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Huge also.  That portion is already under way.  The administration  has taken some really important steps both in terms of process and  addressing specific regulations that are tying up business unnecessarily.</p><p>We can protect our health, our safety, our environment without  unnecessarily making it so difficult for the businesses in America to  create jobs and they are on the way to doing that although that'll be  rolling out over the course of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Josh -- let me ask you.  And I want to ask you about your  Business Roundtable new job as well -- congratulations on that.  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me take you back to when you were the chief of staff, what  do you recommend the President do if he gets interrupted tonight?  If there  are people who are protesting -- we know that Rosie O'Donnell is expected  to be outside leading a protest.  We know that a lot of Democrats are  taking guests who are immigrants or trying to make a point of the  diversified country that we love.  What should President Trump do in that  regard?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Rise above.  This is the moment to be presidential.  Campaign is  over, now the country wants to come together behind one president.</p><p>You know, I think the vast majority of the country, whether they voted for  President Trump or not, want to see him succeed and now is his opportunity  to be really presidential and lead the country towards some of the  priorities that I just mentioned.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As you take on this new role what's your priority at the  Business Roundtable?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Tax, that is huge for the companies that are members of the BRT.   We have 200 CEOs who participate in it.  They represent some of the biggest  companies in the United States, employ 15 million people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they happy with President Trump?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  You know, they are very excited about the opportunity that his  changes in policies might pose -- the tax reform, the regulation, the  infrastructure.  That's why you see so much bounce in the stock market and  you feel it among the members of the BRT as well.  They think there's a  great opportunity here and tonight is the opportunity for the President to  really get that ball rolling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Josh -- we'll be watching  what you do as well at the Business Roundtable.  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTEN:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Josh Bolten joining us there.</p><p>We've got more ahead.  The President's plan to strengthen the military.   Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin joins me next live right here.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with special coverage of  President Trump's address to the joint of congress, live from Washington  D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're happy you're with us this morning.  We're  coming to you live from Washington D.C. I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Tuesday February 28th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p>President Trump will address a joint session of congress for the first time  as our commander-in-chief.  Among the issues tonight to be discussed,  defense.  The president expected to call for a massive increase in spending  to defend our country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget.   Very much based on those two and plenty of other things but very strong.   It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the  depleted military of the United States of America.</p><p>We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's address tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern, so stay with us right  here as we have full analysis and live coverage tonight.</p><p>Will President Trump look to the past for inspiration?  We will bring you  some of the top moments from previous president's first addresses to  congress.</p><p>Coming up this morning.  One stop to watch, today target shares are  plummeting in the free market.  The retailer missed expectations when a  reported revenue and earnings this morning.  The stock is down almost 13  percent.  We are breaking down the numbers to give you backstory on target.</p><p>And it could be a record day on Wall Street nonetheless.  Take a look at  markets here, really trading right around the flat line.  A gain today  would be a 13th record close in the row for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.</p><p>In Europe meanwhile, stocks are searching for direction.  Take a look at  the European indices and you will see most of the average is lower but just  by a fraction.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Take a look at Asian markets  where the Hong Kong Hang Seng index was the loser down three quarters of  one percent.</p><p>The headache continues this morning for Samsung.  The details as the heir  to the brand is indicted on bribery charges.</p><p>And move over TV.  The massive amount of video we are all watching on  YouTube could lead traditional in the dust.  We'll tell you about the  amazing amount of video people are watching.</p><p>Talk about a seal of approval.  The adorable hug that's going viral this  morning.  We'll bring you that.</p><p>But first, our top story this half hour keeping America safe.  President  Donald Trump will seek an additional $54 billion in spending for the  Department of Defense tonight when he makes his speech in front of  congress.</p><p>Yesterday, the commander-in-chief hinted at his plans for the military  budget before he addresses the joint session of congress tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild  the depleted military of the United States of America at a time when most  needed.</p><p>We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to bring in Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.   And secretary Shulkin, it is great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  Thank you.  It's great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  You have so many accolades to discuss.  You're the  sole Obama appointee in this administration.  You were confirmed  unanimously.  People were saying, oh, this is an easy one.  You have been  at the Veterans Affairs, even though the president have said how bad the VA  has been.</p><p>He kept somebody who was there at the VA.  So you've got a great legacy as  you come into this job.  What do you expect to hear from the president  tonight?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, what I'd expect to hear is the strong support for making  sure that we're caring for our men and women who have served our country.   There's a commitment there and that hundred to zero both from the U.S.  congress is not so much about me.  It's really the country's commitment to  making sure that we do everything that we can to deliver on our promise to  our veterans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me one of the biggest issues and how do you fix it and  that is restoring trust and accountability at the VA.  What is your  solution to those?</p><p>SHULKIN:  I think we all know that in the wait time crisis in April 2014,  we did let the country down.  We did let our veterans down.  And it's much  easier to lose trust and it is to gain it back.  </p><p>So we are slowly gaining that trust back and we're seeing that happen as we  really begin to deliver and transform the VA to be a system that we're all  proud of once again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?  Why with those wait times such a problem?  How did that  happen?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think that it was really two things.  One is it was our  lack of willingness to ask for the resources that we needed to care for our  country's veterans and we just fell behind.</p><p>Secondly, it was a culture in the VA of not willing to come forward and  talk about what was really happening to hide those long wait times.</p><p>Frankly, no system is going to be able to regain trust if it isn't  transparent and if it isn't accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have said in the past, look, if a veteran wants to go to a  private medical provider, then do it.  People saw that in, wait a second,  is he for privatization?  Is he going to change something?  What's your  stance on that?</p><p>SHULKIN:  I came from the private sector.  So when I entered the Veterans  Affairs, I was hoping to trying to see whether it made sense to privatize  the VA.  And I quickly learned that the VA is a unique national resource,  that we can't simply just let veterans get all their care in the private  sector, but they'd be losing a lot of very valuable services that are  important to care for men and women.</p><p>So I believe the solution is an integration of what's really great and best  about the VA as well as what's better and best about the private sector.</p><p>Our servicemen and women deserve the very best to what about both these  systems can give them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you're from the private sector, you have an opinion on  private sector people running agencies.  What do you think about the fact  the president has surrounded himself with business people?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think what we need in government is more best practices  of businesses.  I think we need to take what's working in the private  sector and make sure that government can function that way.</p><p>And when government gets bloated, full regulations on red tape, it doesn't  serve people well.  So I think having this private sector people in the  government makes a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got this new Fox News poll out and it shows that voters  more faith in the military compared to other national institutions.   Ninety-six of those surveyed said that they have a great deal or some  confidence in the military.</p><p>Secretary Shulkin, last week you reportedly promised major changes.  We're  coming to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  What can our servicemen and  women expect?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, first of all, that poll makes sense to me.  When I have the  privilege of spending time with our men and women in uniform, you can't  help but feel proud.  These are courageous patriotic Americans that really  should give confidence in the country and I feel confident with them.</p><p>I think the changes that we need or to make VA accountable to essentially  be open and transparent about what's going on and to give more choice so  that people can get the very best of care wherever they need to get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are expecting the president tonight to propose $54 billion  increase spending on the military.  How do you feel about that?  Where do  you think the money ought to go?  Because when we talk about the military  right now, when we speak to veterans, they all tell us they need more  resources.</p><p>SHULKIN:  Yes, what I know from history and I know the president  appreciates this.  When we make a decision to send our men and women off to  protect us and to fight for our country, that's a lifetime commitment.</p><p>And so when you create the spending at the very beginning of the defense  department, you need to have that commitment all the way through for  veterans.  Because we are committed to our veterans for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you identify areas that you believe are absolutely needed  in terms of extra spend?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, we have projections that show what the need is going to be.   We know that our men and women coming back from almost recent conflicts or  coming back with not only physical injuries but also the invisible injuries  of war.  And sometimes, it takes additional resources to be able to make  sure that we're treating those invisible wounds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  And that's something that I think the  president that actually has mentioned as well.</p><p>How do you convince someone who's watching you now the leader at the VA but  you're an insider and someone who says look, this is broken.  We need an  outsider to come in and fix it.  How do you convince them that no, no, no.   You know this and that's why you are the best man to lead this?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, it's not my job to convince people.  I want people to watch  our results.  We are committed to fixing this.  We know we have to do  better and we are going to do better.</p><p>I've been in government now about 18 months.  That's long enough to  understand how the system and where the problems are.  And my discussions  with the president have been that we have to make these changes quickly and  being able to know where the problems are is going to allow us to do that  as quick as we need to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, President Bush visited MacDill Air Force base in  Florida yesterday.  He signed copies of his new book honoring veterans.   Last night, the former commander-in-chief sat down for an interview with  Sean Hannity and talked about his interactions with military families.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm kind of a crier.  When a mom hugs  me and talks about her son, it affected me.  On the other hand, it is hard  for many people to understand.  But when you go to Walter Reed and a  soldier looks at you who's lost his legs, I'd do it again.</p><p>Or you're riding mountain bikes with these troops, some of them lost a leg  who went back into combat.  Or a mother whose son lost her life and said, I  just want you to know my son died doing what he wanted to do.  It lifts  your spirit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Secretary.</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, I recently had a chance to visit with President Bush at his  library in Dallas.  And I have a great deal of respect.  I think that the  president like many of us after he spent time with the men and women that  serve our country, it impacts you.  And he truly feels the commitment to  these men and women.</p><p>And his book his paintings and his life commitment now to those men and  women now to those men and women is really inspiring to me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you look at today's military, the modern military versus  what we saw just 10 years ago, how do you make a distinction?   What's  different today and what are the new realities that required a different  take?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think the big difference is that so many people that are  injured on the battlefield now survive.  And years ago these would have  been injuries that would've killed them.  So we're seeing people come back  with absolutely devastating and complex types of injuries that now we are  responsible for making sure that we provide them with the best care.</p><p>And that complexity has really changed the VA because we need to respond to  those injuries.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you respond effectively?  Is it a money issue?  What is  it that you need in terms of new tools?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think it's in part a money issue, but that really isn't  the big problem.  Fortunately, this president has made the commitment to  support our veterans with the resources we need.</p><p>We also have to be changing.  We have to be looking for new and better ways  to ensure that we are managing and treating the conditions that are coming  back.  This is new territory and that's why VA, not only provides care but  does research.  Our research which is the largest dedicated to veterans is  helping us improve our care every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you hear the conversation taking place right now for  example about ObamaCare, what's your takeaway there knowing what you've  seen at the VA in terms of health care?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think that what we know about the VA is providing a  comprehensive system of care that is providing not only physical treatment  but the psychological, social, economic treatment really is what people  need to have well-being in their life.  And I think this comprehensive  system of care has really been impactful and important for our country's  veterans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you looking toward anything specific that you'd like to  hear from the president tonight in that regard?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I speak to the president.  The president is absolutely  committed not only to a strong country and to a security, but also to  making sure that we honor our commitment.  When we asked people to serve  their country, but that is the lifetime commitment.  That the country's  prepared to follow through on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>SHULKIN:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate your time.  Secretary David Shulkin there.  Fox  Business Network is taking you live to the president's address tonight to a  joint session of congress.</p><p>It kicks off at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.  We've got analysis throughout the  program.  And \"Mornings with Maria\" will be live tomorrow morning right  here in Washington D.C. for in-depth analysis after we hear the president's  address tonight.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  We're live from Washington and we'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The vice chairman of Samsung, four other  officials being indicted.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl,  over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The prosecutors in South  Korea have announced the indictment of Samsung heir and vice chairman Lee  Jae-yong and the other officials.  That happened earlier today.  He was  arrested February 17th and a move that polarized that country.  Lee's  accused of being deeply involved in a corruption scandal that led to the  impeachment of South Korea's president.  He is now charged with bribery,  embezzlement, perjury, hiding assets abroad and concealing profit gained  from criminal acts.</p><p>Another headlines this morning, YouTube users around the world are now  watching more than one billion hours of video a day.  Experts say the  number keeps going up as Google's artificial intelligence continues to  produce as recommended videos to users.</p><p>And YouTube is now threatening traditional television.  Nielsen data shows  Americans watch an average of 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV  shows a day.  Numbers are getting very close.</p><p>And finally this, Maria, I dare you to find a cuter picture than this one.   A feel in a Japanese who was given a plush toy seal by zoo staff.  He  simply just fell in love with the toy.  He hugs the toy.  He puts the toy  on his back for a ride.  These pictures have obviously gone viral.  The  internet is in love as well.  And this probably going to all end up on a  lot of phones.</p><p>And you know what Maria, those are the big stories from New York City.  I  give you the seal.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is so cute, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Coming up, a presidential walk down memory lane.  How President Trump's  tonight to a joint session of congress will compare to his predecessors  over the years.  That's next, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump making his first address to  congress tonight and history shows the speech could have a lasting impact.</p><p>Joining us right now is presidential historian, author of a New Book, \"Game  of Thorns,\" Doug Wead is with us.  And, Doug, it's good to have you on the  program.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>How do you think the president speech will compare to those before him?</p><p>WEAD:  I think he's going to be very different.  I think he will be on  message.  So he's going to talk about the economy and make America great  and he's probably going to go what his critics will say, and his close  friends will say some as off message.</p><p>He'll probably say some a little bizarre thing.  But I've learned in  researching \"Game of Thorns,\" when he's off message, he's on message.   There's two message.  One is restore America, make it great again.  And the  second message is I no politician.  So when he deviates, he's still on  message.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then he always adlibs.  Sometimes it gets him in trouble.   But he does always adlibs.  So one of the most emotional addresses over the  years was from Lyndon Johnson.  Sworn in just days after the assassination  of John F. Kennedy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNDON JOHNSON 36TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  All I have that I would have given  gladly not to be standing here today.  No words are sad enough to express  our sense of loss.  No words are strong enough to express our  determination, to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, this was an emotional moment in time.  But explain  the emotional impact that this had on the country.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, this was a very tough time for the country, a hurtful time for  the country.  And for Lyndon Johnson personally.  This was a devastating  moment.  He was a great man.  He was a powerful man, that dominating force  in Washington but he was now destined forever to live in the shadow of John  F. Kennedy.  This young upstart who took power.  </p><p>So personally, this was a frustrating moment for Lyndon Johnson.  But he  knew the role he was destined to play by history and he had to play it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, we're expecting to hear a lot about the economy tonight,  tax reform, rollback of regulation.  That was something President Reagan  brought up during his address.  Let's take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONALD RAEGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  Almost eight million Americans are out  of work.  These are people who want to be productive.  The threat of  layoffs and unemployment hangover other millions and all who work are  frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.  We must begin  now.  But people are watching and waiting.  They don't demand miracles.   They do expect us to act.  Let us act together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Act together.  Your thoughts.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes.  Reagan gave one of the few joint speeches to the joint  sessions where he actually did what he said he was going to do and I expect  Donald Trump to be that kind of president.  Most of these speeches when you  study them, they'll give the speech and they do the exact opposite.  It's  uncanny.</p><p>But in this case, I think Trump like Reagan is going to do what he's  telegraphing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can he balance, guys, this presidential demeanor, but also be  Donald Trump?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I wanted to call out if any of the  democrats have called him or boo him.  I wanted to point to them and call  them out by name and say, who are you booing?  And then call them all their  nonsense, I would actually love to see that.  It's not presidential, but it  could be Trumpian.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'd like to see him say, OK, congressmen, such and such,  you're with illegal immigrant that's done terrific things in this country.   That's exactly the kind of immigrants we want.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I'm looking at is other undertones of Andrew  Jackson.  This is what we got in the inaugural.  Steve Bannon gave -- it  was very involved in this speech.  It had a lot of America first  nationalist undertones that hearken back to Andrew Jackson.</p><p>Do you think we're going to see that in this feature?  Or are we going to  see a different kind of president?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, we're seeing it in his handling of the media because Andrew  Jackson was devastated by what the media did to his wife that killed his  wife and he hated the media, organized his own network of newspapers to  oppose them.</p><p>In \"Game of Thorns,\" I get into the media problems that Donald Trump has  and it's staggering.  The left and the right are opposed to this guy.  Much  of it has to do about China.  And I have to say this.  My name is on the  book, but the people who really gave the information to me from the book or  sources who risk their jobs, they were with Hillary Clinton for 10, 15, 20  years.  And there's some people in China who risk their lives to give this  information about the Chinese flow of money to the Clintons.  So it's a  serious issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is a serious issue.  And the book is \"Game of Thorns.\"  And  we expect it's going to be a big seller.  Thank you so much Doug Wead.   We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Good to see you everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  Great setting.  Once again, back in  Washington as we preview the president's plans tonight.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.  Big increases in defense  spending, big increases in infrastructure spending, and it sounds like he's  directing his agencies to cutback spending in places like the EPA and the  state department.  All the money that's been going overseas, he wants to  keep it at home, America first, that's his message.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But also, what does he say about the repeal and replace of  ObamaCare because, again, he conceded yesterday that the health law is  unbelievably complex according to President Trump and then also tax reform.  </p><p>I've got a little -- there's a line at the bottom of an article in the New  York Times today that might give investors pause.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  On the tax reform package.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On the tax reform package.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got a lot to talk about on that, that is a big story, you're  so right.  We're going to continue that this morning.</p><p>And joining us this morning and joining the conversation, Veterans Affair  Secretary, David Shulkin, this is his second secretary from the president's  cabinet to speak out.  We, of course, heard from the Treasury Secretary  yesterday, Steen Mnuchin.  And this morning, we hear from VA Secretary,  David Shulkin right here with us.  Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us.  And Tennessee  Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn will join us.  Plus, Ohio Congressman, Tim  Ryan is going to walk through the democrat's plan.  And Former Chief of  Staff under Bush 43 and Business Rountable President and CEO, Josh Bolton,  that's a new role for Josh Bolten, I'm going to talk with him about it.</p><p>Big show ahead, so stay right there and do stay with us as we kick it off  right now with our story.  President Trump is set to outline his agenda on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  At the  address, with joint session of congress tonight.  (inaudible) with details  right now, all the specifics at the White House.  Peter, good morning to  you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Maria.  That's right,  we're getting more details on the president's speech tonight from some of  his top aides.</p><p>And as you mentioned, he will discuss a number of initiatives including  healthcare reform, infrastructure, border security and other issues.  He'll  also review the accomplishments of his first month, in particular those  executive orders and his Supreme Court nominee.  The president sat down  with Fox &amp; Friends to give us a preview of his remarks, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from the heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming out.  We have to  understand, ObamaCare has been a disaster, it's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border.</p><p>And remember this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting  the bad ones out, the bad people, gang members, drug lords, in some cases,  murders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Now we expect tonight that his most concrete largest initiative  will be his announcement, his call for another $54 billion in defense  spending, he will ask congress for that, a 10 percent increase his aide  say.</p><p>An administration official said however that the broad theme of the speech  will be the renewal of America and the optimistic vision for all Americans,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  And, of course, we're all  focused on where the spending is going to be.  Peter Barnes, thank you at  the White House this morning.  Rachel Campos-Duffy with us this morning,  and Rachel, a Senior White House Official describing President Trump's  speech tonight as a renewal of the American spirit.</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's a great way to  describe it, everything.</p><p>This guy's going to have an audience like nobody's business tonight.  I  mean he's a showman, the inauguration was a big speech but that was at  12:00 in the afternoon, this is primetime, people want to see what he's  going to say and the democrats are making a little bit interesting with  their bringing in guests or they're going to mix it up.</p><p>I hear Meryl Streep might come, I heard she was invited, they're bringing  dreamers and all kinds of people to mix it up and I think he's got a real  opportunity to give an optimistic message and a brand new start.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny that they say Meryl Streep is going to attend  because the word was Rosie O'Donnell was going to be protesting outside  actually.  So that will be exciting.</p><p>But in terms of the audience, Dagen, what's your take on this because a lot  of the democrats are saying, \"Look, we want to bring someone who came here  as an immigrant, is now an American citizen but has contributed to our  country in a good way\" as a message to the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what message are they trying to send?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because, again --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're so right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- we make the distinction between illegal immigrants that he  addresses that so many people in this country think that illegal  immigration is a problem, we're not talking about legal immigrants who have  come to this country whether it is through visas and through -- and have  gotten green cards, that's not the message.</p><p>And by the way, in his move to stop illegal immigration, he said we're not  going to touch dreamers or children who are here under the deferred action  on children under President Obama, that's number one.  And at least the  democrats are showing up which remember the dozens who do not show up to  the inauguration at least will be there.  I dare them to boo, I dare them  to boo.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  That will happen.  That will happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shame on them.</p><p>HILSENRANTH:  When you talk about democrats, one of the important things we  have to think about is the president announces his plans for spending.   He's going to need some democratic support, he needs 60 votes to pass his  appropriations measures.</p><p>So he's got to find some ways to reach out at the -- if he wants to  increase military spending, wants to increase infrastructure spending and  cutback all these agencies, he's got to get some democrats on board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out, he needs the democrats for the  replacement in ObamaCare in the senate as well.  If the repeal is easy  under the -- you can just -- you get a simple majority on the  reconciliation but it's the replacement and that becomes a huge hurdle in  the next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, that is why they did ObamaCare first because  they didn't want to have to deal with needing the extra votes for tax  reform.  They do that during the budget reconciliation and they feel that  it's an easier path to get that done, that's why ObamaCare's first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You want to know the line that investors should pay attention  to?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's in the New York Times, it is the last paragraph with an  article about the healthcare law and it mentions that as Steve Mnuchin the  Treasury Secretary told you that they want tax reform, tax cuts for both  businesses and middle class Americans by in time with the August recess.</p><p>The last line says, \"Since healthcare must be addressed first, tax  legislation could easily be pushed into 2018 according to members of  congress and administration officials.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's critical.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Even Mnuchin has said that August is ambitious.  So when he  sat down with us he acknowledge that it might go a little bit later.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But they still have October -- they still have the fall to  finish some of this stuff, I think that's (inaudible).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the expectation based on this market run up, some of it  is just fundamental but the expectation is to gets done in this year and  not 2018.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you tried to take those expectations down little by  little?  There's a real nuance in terms of the way they're speaking all the  officials about this?</p><p>But look, Steven Mnuchin said very clearly that the real impact is going to  be in 2018 and I think that -- and you know really took our expectations  down first.  When we were hearing in Washington, remember Ted Cruz?   Remember Ted Cruz was the first person to say and we felt, \"Wait a minute,  we thought we were going to get tax reform right away\" but ever since then  they've been taking these expectations down.</p><p>So let's talk about the budget for a second because we're looking for a $20  billion boost in military spending, the president has also hinted at more  infrastructure spending during a meeting with governors, he said this  yesterday at the White House, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to make it easier for the states to invest in  infrastructure and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on  infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East and we have  potholes all over our highways and our roads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On that note, infrastructure stocks fight on Wall Street after  the commander-in-chief's announcement, let's take a look.  This is one of  the areas Jon Hilsenrath that has been leading this rally, the  infrastructure, construction aides.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And this is an area where he might actually be able to  get some democratic buy-in because you want people on both sides, in fact,  the Obama Administration wanted the infrastructure spending too.</p><p>So -- and I think the other reason we saw infrastructure stocks reacting  yesterday is we haven't heard a lot about that, there's been a lot of talk  about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, a lot of talk about military  spending and tax cuts, we haven't heard so much about the infrastructure  piece of this and how they're going to fund it.  So the fact that he's  brining that back up again makes you think, \"All right, maybe it is on the  agenda.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And on the military spending side, his proposed increase in  defense spending $54 billion, 10 percent increase, it's only $18.5 billion  above levels proposed by President Obama and it's short of what the likes  of Senator John McCain want.  </p><p>The Trump Administration is talking about a little over $600 billion,  McCain wants $640 billion.  So it's even -- so when you talk about  additional spending, they could go further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, the big question for me is how do you pay for this  stuff?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's easy to convince people to spend more money up here on  Capitol Hill but how is he going to be able to get the cuts in all these  other programs to -- that pays for it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And no -- questioning no changes to Medicare and Social  Security.  Those are the big kind of tsunamis waiting for the Americans.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The obvious answer is bigger deficits.  But as he has said so  many times including this campaign, $20 trillion debt, how do you do all  this with $20 trillion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going to put the debt over the long-term and they're  going to look at it over the long-term and not look at that as a near-term  priority, obviously.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're going to allow --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got a lot of plans, they have to do that.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  And I think they're going to think they can grow out  of this as well.  I mean you're seeing the (inaudible) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't grow out of Medicare and Social Security.  You can't  grow out of the entitlement.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  No, not of Social Security, not over the entitlement but as  far as paying and also we've seen him take airplanes that costs billions of  dollars and not millions of dollars off the price.</p><p>So people are expecting him to do that and look, he's a builder.  People  want him to build and unlike the stimulus where -- I don't know what came  out of that, I can't find a road that was built from that and all the  (inaudible) jobs, this somebody who said he's going to build people's trust  that he once built, he wants to do this, he's let congress know this was a  huge priority for him and people trust him with this part of building, they  like him.  So they think he's the one to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep navigating what we're expecting tonight.   And Fox Business Network is taking you live to the president's address  tonight as he addresses a joint session of congress tonight at 9:00pm  Eastern.</p><p>Mornings with Maria will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. for  in-depth analysis as well.  We are previewing it this morning and we will  have the full announcements tomorrow with all the names you want weighing  in.  </p><p>We'll take a short break, when we come back, tragedy in California, a plane  has crashed into a home killing four people, injuring two others, the  latest on the survivor's conditions, that's coming next.</p><p>And then Takata pleading guilty, the details as the Japanese auto parts  maker agrees to pay $1 billion fine in their airbag scandal, so many  automakers getting caught up in that, we'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane has crashed in Southern  California, it left four people dead.  Cheryl Casone is in New York with  the details now, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria from our studio  here in New York.  Well that plane crashed into two homes killing at least  four and injuring two others.  Cell phone video caught the moment of the  crash, you can see huge flames and thick smoke following an explosion.   Witnesses described a chaotic scene.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the back house of the neighbors are exiting, an elderly man exiting,  firefighters were taking people to safety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on the plane, they  were flying back home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  Fire official say one of the teenagers was thrown from a  backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl had only minor injuries.  The  pilot also survived this crash we should say.</p><p>Well in other news, Japanese auto parts maker, Takata is now pleading  guilty of fraud and agreeing to pay a billion dollars for concealing a  defect in millions of its airbags.  The defect has been blamed for at least  11 deaths in the U.S. alone and more than a 180 injuries worldwide.  And,  of course, the biggest recall in American auto history involving 42 million  cars and as to 69 million airbags.</p><p>Well, as investors await President Trump's address to congress tonight,  they're going to be watching earnings from Target before the bell this  morning.  The retail chain expected to post earnings of a $1.51 share on  sales of $20.74 billion and, of course. we'll get to look at the holiday  season for that company.  Other companies reporting this morning, AutoZone,  Domino's Pizza, and Etsy.  </p><p>And finally this Maria, Snap, the parent of Snapchat gearing up for that  huge $3.2 billion IPO that's going to be Thursday, on the New York Stock  Exchange.  Ahead of the big debut, the company says it expects investors  who buy as much as a quarter of the shares to agree not to sell them for a  year.  This could be a single demand, it's pretty high for this offering  Maria.  Snap targeting evaluation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion  and, again, that stock is going to be listed on the New York Stock  Exchange, the ticker will be snap.</p><p>And those are your headlines from New York, Maria back to you at  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thanks so much.  Let's take a short break,  when we come back, President Trump pointing fingers what he claims Obama is  behind the recent protests at town hall meetings.  </p><p>The Warren Buffett takes a big bite out of Apple, they're Berkshire  Hathaway more than doubling its stake in the technology giant, we got all  those details certainly has been a money maker for Warren Buffett this last  few months, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well into the battle of the presidents now,  President Trump is blaming President Obama for the country's lack of unity,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it.  I also think it's politics, that's  the way it is.  And look, I have a very different understanding --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Bush wasn't going after Clinton, Clinton was going  after Bush.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes.   You know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  I  think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly  behind it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us here on set.   Mark, what do you make of this?</p><p>MARK PENN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR HILLARY CLINTON:  Well I think it's so  unfortunate because I think today really Trump have to reach out to the  other side.  I mean I think that's the critical opportunity he's got with  his speech today, why throw Obama, at Obama, why divided up this early in  the morning.  Big mistake in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I definitely agree that there's no room for sort of  pointing fingers when we have all the big issues at hand that the president  and everyone else is trying to do but I want to be clear, in President  Obama's last speech to the country, he did say organized a few times.</p><p>If you don't like what's going on, get up and make some noise.  I mean he  did say things like that in that last speech, didn't he?</p><p>PENN:  Yes.  But look, the president's got to get democrats and republicans  applauding tonight.  If this gets so rough during the day and Obama comes  out, democrats will start boycotting, he'll get the opposite of what he was  looking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you've done this so many times, you have supervised six  speeches, presidential speeches.  When you say he's got to get everybody  applauding, talk about that.  How important is that and why is that so  important to get the whole room buying in right away?</p><p>PENN:  Look, the reaction of the room and the willingness of everyone to  applaud him at anything, right, is gold for him.</p><p>I remember in 1998, we didn't know whether or not the country is going to  impeach President Clinton until they stood up and applauded.  He has a  similar moment, right?  The democrats have never applauded him, he's got to  start out I think with something like the military and honoring the  military so that he gets everybody applauding and in that mode because  remember, he'll talk about infrastructure and some people will applaud,  he'll talk about taxes, he'll talk about immigration and a lot will sit on  their hands.  He needs a key moment of unity to make the speech successful  because that's what people are looking for at home.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think he's looking at it that way though?  I mean he's  so unconventional, his inaugural speech was not what most people expected,  very America first.  I mean he could come at this from a completely  different angle, didn't he?</p><p>PENN:  He could.  And I think if it gets raucous, remember, I conducted a  Harvard-Harris Poll last week, 73 percent want democrats to work with  republicans and 68 percent want Trump to work with the democrats.  So he  doesn't show that tonight then his ratings are going to start to really go  down here because they want that done.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But could it be also that if the democrats behave so badly  that it ends up just making them look bad and so maybe he doesn't feel like  he has to try to win them over rather than talk about the military you  said.  </p><p>And the more they misbehave, the more of them that gave their tickets to  code pink to interrupt and really sort of hashtag resist that it's going to  make the dems look back.</p><p>PENN:  Well, what we've seen for the first time is the republicans have a  slightly higher image in the Wall Street Journal poll than democrats.  So I  don't think the resistance strategy has been working.  So I think tonight,  the democrats will do better if they can show some unity around some key  issues and resistance around others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think you make a great point and this weekend on  Sunday Morning Futures, I interviewed Congressman Langevin who is bringing  with him tonight a Pakistani born doctor who is here in America, he's a  Muslim-American by the way.</p><p>He's legally here, he's done great things for this country in terms of his  work but I kept pushing back at him saying, look, there's a different  between legal and illegal, why are you grandstanding?  Why bring the guest  anyway?  Why not just go to the speech, sleeves rolled up, ready to work  and get the people's business done?  And so that's the issue, why the  grandstanding?  Just let's get to work.</p><p>PENN:  Well the balcony traditionally has been used in these speeches.   Usually the president's balcony is the most important thing that he can add  to his speech.  The democrats are doing it in reverse, they're saying,  \"Hey, what about the guys whose he's excluding?  What about the people here  who may be here illegally but are operating legally and following our laws?   What's going to them?\"  </p><p>And I think it's fair that they raise that issue but remember, look, the  business community wants to hear about infrastructure and tax cuts, they've  been waiting, if they don't hear that, there's going to be some I think  serious negative consequences.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There have been a slew of holes out over the last few days  including the Wall Street Journal's polls which showed that the public is  for the president's policies, they have some questions about the way he's  behaving, what jumped out at you from these polls?  What did you learn  about his first couple of months in office and how the public is receiving  it?</p><p>PENN:  Well he doesn't have honeymoon ratings, on the other hand, his  ratings are no lower than Obama's or Clinton's or Bush's were during most  of the presidency.  He's in the high 40s I think in most of the polls.  </p><p>My poll came out at 48 percent job approval, he hasn't reached over to the  rest of the country but he's got a strong base, people support a good  measure of his policies, they think he will bring change in the Wall Street  Journal poll.  So he's got a lot of things working for him but the division  that he's creating, comments like the Obama thing really are creating this  division that is holding him back from being president of everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you really think that there isn't a group of Obama  loyalists that may very well be behind the protesters?</p><p>PENN:  I think the protesters is genuine because --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you say that's not real really?</p><p>PENN:  Because remember, Trump is in fact following the strategy of  dividing the country in his speeches.  Dividing the country with comments  like that.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well President Obama did that (inaudible) he's pointing a lot  it's the republican's fault on every turn.  Come on.</p><p>PENN:  Look, for every action there's a reaction in politics.  So I think  the protests are real, I think the sentiment he stirred up are real.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And he's the first act community organizer president and  it's very clear that they are -- I just went to a town hall with my husband  yesterday and it was very well -- they have a pamphlet, they have a  strategy, they organized ahead of time, they eat an hour before the town  hall starts.</p><p>I mean, there's an organization behind it and that's fine, people should  come and talk to their congressmen but it's really unseemly I think to have  an ex-president really putting his weight behind that in that way.  I think  it's divisive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know exactly what the president is doing obviously,  President Obama.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's only a mile from the Capitol.  He's living just right  here for a reason.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This group organizing for action, we don't know how involved  the president is in direct to the activities.  But this group that was  associated with the Obama's campaign organizing for action, the word is  that they're involved in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that Soros is involved hugely in this step.  Before  we --  </p><p>PENN:  That there's real sentiment behind these protests.  You can't  organize people who don't care about things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, I want to get your take on Tom Perez as the  Democratic National Committee chair.  What's your take?  </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I -- I think -- I think that it's great that -- that he  won.  I think that Democrats and a -- a lot of Jewish supporters and donors  would have real problems had he not won.  </p><p>And I think it reaffirms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he put Keith Ellison as his deputy, though.  </p><p>PENN:  Well, but, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, that's -- that's the guy that a lot of moderates didn't  want.  </p><p>PENN:  But that at least shows, look, we've got to bring the party  together.  I think they came out of that pretty well because the scare was  that -- that, in fact, the party would take such a turn to the left.  </p><p>And the answer was it didn't.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, why do you -- why do you say Jewish donors would have.</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think -- I think -- I think there was a lot of concern about  Ellison.  Haim Saban (ph), for example, said he would not, you know, if I  remember it correctly, would -- would no longer support Democrats.  I (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of his comments about Israel.  </p><p>PENN:  .well, because that's right.  And -- and so I think that would  really have stirred it up.  But -- but I do think they brought the party  together.  </p><p>They had to do that.  I think -- I think the Democrats are in better shape.   The question is, when are they going to get a strategy -- a legislative  strategy here that makes sense in response to -- to Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and in response to what the people want.  Let's face it.   It's -- it's really economic issues that the people are hoping that the  Democrats focus on.  </p><p>Mark, great insights from you as always.  </p><p>PENN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Penn joining us there.  we're going to  take a short break.  </p><p>When we come back, President Trump speaking to a joint session of Congress  tonight.  He's expecting to call for a substantial increase in military  spending -- what it means for your security.  </p><p>And then new drinks sprouting out (ph) at Starbucks -- the beverages coming  to the menu just in time for spring.  We'll be back in two minutes' time,  back in a moment (ph).  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks for  being with us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  We are coming here from Washington.  It is Tuesday,  February 28.  Your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time as commander-in-chief.  The president is expected to stress  unity during the speech.  </p><p>However, before taking the stage, the president blamed his predecessor for  tensions in the country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are  certainly behind it.  And some of the leaks possibly come from that group,  you know, some of the leaks which are really very serious leaks because  they're very bad in terms of national security.  </p><p>But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him being behind  things, that's politics.  </p><p>And it will probably continue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network will bring you live coverage of the  president's address tonight.  That's at 9 p.m. Eastern.  </p><p>So stay with us on the Fox Business Network as we will have full analysis  and live coverage of that presidential address.  It could be another record  day in Wall Street.  </p><p>Futures are indicating the markets are flat right now.  But the lifting --  the Dow Industrial is up about 13 points.  </p><p>The Dow coming off of a record, 12th consecutive record high yesterday,  tying the record set 30 years ago.  Now, a gain today would be a 13th  record close in a row.  </p><p>That's never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.  And as you can see,  the markets are looking really fractionally moving. </p><p>But the Dow is, in fact, trading in all-time record territory.  Take a look  at European markets.  Stocks are searching for direction there with  fractional gain.  </p><p>And the DAX index is actually lower.  The others are fractionally higher.   Target revenue misses expectations.  </p><p>As you see there, we're watching earnings this morning.  And Target is  missing estimates on both earnings and revenue -- the numbers on the bottom  of your screen.  </p><p>We're going to take a look at the stock in a moment.  In Asia overnight,  meanwhile, markets were mixed.  </p><p>Take a look.  Shanghai and the Nikkei as well as the Kospi up, the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong down.  Well, at least 15 people injured in another crash  at Brazil's carnival celebration.  The details after a float collapses.  </p><p>Plus Warren Buffett taking a big bite out of Apple -- why the billionaire  investor is betting big on the technology giant.  And Starbucks is adding  to its menu -- how you can soon get your hands on the new iced drinks just  in time for spring, plus details on the company's new upscale roastery.  </p><p>Plus, Antonio Brown cashes in in the Steel City.  We are breaking down the  wide receiver's massive new contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </p><p>We want to hear about that.  First, our top story, though, this half hour.   Bolstering the nation's military -- that's a top priority for President  Trump.  </p><p>The White House says that the president's first budget proposal will  include a $54 billion increase in defense spending.  Military stocks like  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon rallied on the news.  </p><p>The move will likely garner plenty of public support.  The latest fox news  poll shows that 45 percent of Americans believe the country is spending too  little on military.  </p><p>Dagen is talking about this and looking at these proposals this morning.   What are your thoughts on this budget, Dagen? </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that it's a balancing act for  President Trump that he is -- he promised to increase spending on defense.   There's a 10 percent increase there, a little more than $400 billion, but  not at the levels (ph) that, say, a Senator John McCain has been calling  for. </p><p>And we should also point out that his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has - - That (ph) Senator McCain did not like him, doesn't really like him,  because he has been a deficit hawk.  And so, I think that you're getting --  you're getting something for people who want greater military spending,  greater defense spending, but also people who worry about a $20 trillion  debt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, when you -- when you take a look.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's -- there's always the (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  .when you speak to military people, Jon, they always say that  we've got the oldest fleet in the Navy in -- in decades.  We're got the  oldest, you know, armament in the Army in decades.  I mean.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .we need upgrade, particularly as it relates to -- to  technology.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And as Dagen just pointed out, there's always  been this tension in the Republican Party, between the deficit hawks and  the military hawks.  And we see it between Mulvaney -- Mulvaney and McCain.  </p><p>And I think that's something that the president is going to have to wrestle  with over the next few months as he tries to take the ideas that he's going  to be talking about tonight and turn them into -- into actual policy.  </p><p>There is tension inside the Republican Party and within his plans between  controlling all of the debt, controlling the deficit and achieving all of  these goals if he wants to set out tax reform, military spending,  infrastructure spending, and most importantly, as -- as you said earlier,  there's going to be no -- no talk tonight about doing anything on Social  Security and Medicare.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  They were very clear about that.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How do you make all of this fit together? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is -- which, to somebody worried about the debt and the  looming tsunami of -- so Medicare is going to go broke.  The hospital trust  fund goes broke 11 years from now.  </p><p>And we'll only be able to pay out 87 cents on the dollar in benefits.   Sixty-nine percent of our budget is mandatory spending on entitlements and  interest on the debt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So more than two-thirds, they have no control over.  So when you  start talking about cutting the EPA, you're really just chipping away.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, agree (ph), I mean, that's the important point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's small potatoes, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  What he's going to be talking about tonight is cutting back on  the discretionary programs, a lot coming out of the State Department,  foreign aide, foreign diplomacy, America First.  But you -- you can't solve  these problems in the long run just by -- by cutting back discretionary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, when was the last time you heard a politician come out  and say, I promised you this and now, I'm taking it back?  I mean, the --  for those people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare and  Medicaid, they don't want those programs touched.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they were promised.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, the idea -- idea is you don't do it for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they ever paid in.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .the idea is you don't it to -- you don't do it to people who  are getting it now.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But you tell people who are in their 30s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .and 40s, you -- you might have to expect to work a little bit  longer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and most people understand that, right?  I mean, they  get that they -- that these programs are going broke.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They -- they like to know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So at some point.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .more (ph) because they think they're going to get nothing  as -- if the system goes bankrupt the way it is right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they -- but.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The younger people are not expecting.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They're not expecting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Younger people are not expecting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  We talked to Jon two minutes (ph) ago, I'm not going to get  any (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  They -- that's what I'm saying.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, it's -- it's still a third rail because that no one in  this town can get it -- can get anything done on it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And the president himself doesn't, you know, he said he  campaigned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even the most conservative people, when they close to retirement  age, they're like I'm getting mine.  I'm taking mine.  I have arguments  with my parents about this all the time.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I paid in (ph).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- I tell them -- they're saying (ph) -- well, I paid, and  I said but you're taking more than you paid in.  That's why it's going  broke.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And Mark Zuckerberg doesn't need it.  I mean, you know what  I'm saying?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  There's -- there's some ways that we can cut back on certain  incomes that people don't actually need (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you know, I mean, a guy like -- a business guy like -- like  a Ken Lagone has been on this program and said, I don't want this Social  Security check that I get.  I don't need it. </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Don't send it to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I'm just saying there are certain -- there are certain  pockets of the population that understand that this is not happening over  the long term.  And they're not expecting it.  </p><p>And yet, the leadership is afraid.  They're afraid to make that move  because that will be the political ad (ph), they took your Social Security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  It's well (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's the granny off the cliff ad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we roll (ph) that.  I'm just kidding.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But it's also real.  I was at a town hall yesterday where a  woman was in tears saying, I depend on this.  So please tell me you're not  going to cut this (ph).  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But this is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  So it is very real.  </p><p>Jon:  But they have a very hard time getting across the message that we're  not going to take away from you but we want to give people 10, 20, 30 years  to prepare to work a few extra months in their life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It means you have to educate the public.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And then but anytime they try to raise that idea, it  immediately gets translated into you're taking Social Security checks away  from older people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, last night, former President George W. Bush sat  down for interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.  The former president  said he was frustrated when U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq.  </p><p>But he still believes ISIS can be defeated.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Yes, it frustrated me.  And it -- I  think what people have got to realize is this bunch of thugs can be  defeated because we did so with the surge.  And we can win again.  </p><p>And so you've heard both presidents after my time say we're going to  degrade and defeat ISIS.  And I say, go get them because they can be  degraded and defeated.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because when you look back at some  of the -- the -- some of the conversation that President Bush has had as it  relates to this topic in the past, he's been very clear.  He said, if we  pull out of Iraq, this will create another problem.  </p><p>This will motivate and empower another group.  And we don't know what their  names are right now.  </p><p>This was years ago, he said this.  And now we know what happened.  ISIS was  created.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We  -- we (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that it was reassuring to see  General Mattis go to Iraq.  He knows that.  </p><p>The civil war that if we pull out of Iraq at this point -- we -- we have to  discuss actually adding troops.  We have several thousand troops still in  Iraq.  </p><p>We have to discuss that.  That's why General Mattis was so reassuring to  see him pay that visit very early on in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Jon?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well -- and we're -- we're seeing the Iraqis now make some  progress and in Mosul, though it's a tough battle.  We had a story in the  paper the other day about how ISIS is using drones against Iraqi forces.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right, I saw that.  That was inside (ph).  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  If he says we're going to defeat ISIS in his speech tonight,  he's going to get a sounding -- a standing ovation.  People want him to do  this.  </p><p>And hearing George Bush.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .say yes, we -- we've done it before -- we can do this, we  can defeat these barbarians, people want to hear that.  He'll get  bipartisan support on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and Mark Penn just said, he needs to get the room on  their feet.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .and in unity.  We'll see about that.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, tweeting may be to blame for Oscar's biggest  mistake in history.  </p><p>We'll tell you what happened behind the scenes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's true.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was Twitter.  And then failure to launch, fearsome (ph)  delays in Tesla's Model 3 release causing stocks to turn downward -- the  impact next, back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We're coming to you live from our country's capital with the  gorgeous sunrise behind us as you see there.  </p><p>We are enjoying this beautiful moment here in Washington as we preview the  president's speech tonight.  Markets are looking flat.  </p><p>But we're watching a couple of names on the move.  Target shares -- the one  to watch this morning.  That stock is plummeting in the premarket.  </p><p>The retailer missed earnings expectations.  They missed it on both revenue  and earnings this morning with their quarterly report.  </p><p>Earnings in the fourth quarter -- a dollar $0.45 a -- lower than the -- a  dollar $0.45 a share.  That was lower than the estimate which called for a  dollar $0.51 a share.  </p><p>Target shares look like this this morning, down better than 12 percent.  It  is down about 12 percent on Target.  </p><p>Tesla also a name to watch.  The stock is down following a downgrade from  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman is lowering its price target on the stock from  $1.90 to $1.85.  </p><p>And they issued a sell (ph) rating on Tesla.  That rating is centered on  concerns over the company's upcoming Model 3 sedan.  </p><p>We're watching Priceline this morning.  The company's fourth quarter  earnings topped expectations.  Priceline reported earnings of $14.21 a  share, versus the $13.01 that was expected.  </p><p>The stock is up better than 11 percent this year alone.  Meanwhile, another  accident with a float marring the carnival celebration in Rio de Janeiro.   Cheryl Casone with the details now.  </p><p>Cheryl?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So it's the second float accident in Rio this week.   This time, the top of a he float collapsed with dancers on board.  </p><p>And 11 people were injured, two of those victims said to be in serious  condition, one with head trauma.  The parade had to be stopped for almost  25 minutes so the injured could get medical attention.  </p><p>The show was allowed to go on.  Now, police are investigating the cause of  that accident.  On Sunday, you may remember, 20 people were hurt when a  float crashed into a fence.  </p><p>Well, Warren Buffett has taken a bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway's stake at Apple now more than double what it was at the  start of the year.  </p><p>Berkshire now owns about 133 million shares of Apple.  At the end of last  year, that figure was 57 million.  </p><p>After the recent Apple buying spree, Berkshire Hathaway's stake now sits at  about $18 billion.  Well, Starbucks introducing two new drinks just in time  for spring.  </p><p>The Cinnamon Almond Macchiato and the Coconut Macchiato hits stores today  for at least a limited time.  Starbucks is also making another addition --  it's not to the menu, though.  </p><p>They are going to open one of the roasteries in Milan, Italy in late 2018,  marking their first store in Italy.  Starbucks plans to open nearly 30  roasteries worldwide, we should say.  </p><p>And it turns out the ratings were also a big blunder Sunday night.  The  Oscar's ratings tanked the lowest in nine years -- just 32.9 million  viewers turned in.  </p><p>That is more than a million less than last year.  And now, we're learning  more about the best picture disaster -- an Oscar first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JORDAN HOROWITZ, \"LA LA LAND\" PRODUCER:  There's -- there's a mistake.   \"Moonlight,\" you guys won best picture.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  \"Moonlight\" won.  This is not a joke.  </p><p>HOROWITZ:  This is not a joke.  I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not a joke.  \"Moonlight\" has won best picture.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  So what's the Pricewaterhouse Coopers, who caused the disaster,  distracted just minutes before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong  envelope, he tweeted this photo of best actress winner, Emma Stone,  backstage.  Now, the mix-up happened just three minutes later when he  handed Beatty the wrong envelope.  </p><p>Cullinan's tweets reportedly not sanctioned by the academy.  He deleted the  tweet later and all other posts that he had made during the show, Maria.  </p><p>So the story continues.  And that's it.  Back to you out in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he was tweeting and maybe got distracted and gave the wrong  envelope.  Oops.  Yes, big oops.  </p><p>All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, it's a done deal.   Antonio Brown, now the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL -- details on  his massive new contract next, back in a moment, live from Washington on a  beautiful Tuesday morning.       </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Pittsburgh Steelers making Antonio Brown the  NFL's highest-paid wide receiver yesterday, Jared max with the details now. </p><p>Jared, good morning to you.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Antonio Brown  has caught more passes in the last four years than any receiver in NFL  history during the same time span.  </p><p>To the Pittsburgh Steelers, that's what Brown can do for you.  Now, we see  what you did for him.  </p><p>The Steelers yesterday announced that Antonio Brown, who caught 12  touchdowns and totaled 1,300 yards last season, has signed a new contract  to keep him in a Steelers uniform through 2021.  It includes a $19 million  signing bonus and Brown's four-year extension calls for $68 million,  average salary $17 million a year, $2 million more than Cincinnati's A.J.  Green.  </p><p>Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Tim Tebow, got into the batter's  box for the first time yesterday at New York Mets spring training at Port  St. Lucie, Florida.  Now, 29 years old and trying to make another career in  professional baseball, Tebow showed off his strength.  </p><p>Florida Gators legend smashed nine home runs in batting practice yesterday,  impressed some baseball scouts.  Adidas, all day I dream about sand --  check this out, Adidas says it's giving away an island to any pro-football  prospect at the NFL Combine who can break the record for the fastest 40- yard dash at the Combine, which is 4.7 seconds set by Chris Johnson nine  years ago.  </p><p>But the player would have to be wearing these Adidas -- Adizero 5-Star 40  Cleats and agree to wear them for the entire upcoming season.  Now, should  a player break the record, he could wind up with his own island, Adidas  says, as soon as reasonably possible.  </p><p>Or Adidas could also just pay the athlete $1 million.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, Jared, that's -- that's pretty incredible.  I want  to switch gears and ask you about Warren Buffett announcing yesterday that  employees have a chance to win a million dollars for a year for life.  They  only have to predict the correct Sweet 16 for the NCAA men's basketball  tournament.  </p><p>What do you think about that?  Do you think somebody will actually predict  the Sweet 16 perfectly? </p><p>MAX:  That's -- that's unlikely.  I mean, that's predicting 16 out of 16  from a field that (ph) starts with, what, 68 teams.  </p><p>But they've done this contest before Warren Buffett -- last year, Warren  Buffett had -- he gave out $50,000 to two different employees for each  guessing the most correct picks during the NCAA tournament.  And there was  also a time when he gave away money for the most consecutive picks during  the tournament.  </p><p>I love seeing these new contests that -- that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MAX:  .are going on in sports.  I mean, this Adidas thing and you know,  this -- it's cool stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's going to predict the perfect Sweet 16?  Come on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's mathematically impossible almost.  It's literally  impossible to predict the Sweet 16.  There's no chance in a pot fiery hell  (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No wonder Buffett says you can have a million dollars.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's why -- that's why he's making -- that's why he's making  the offer.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right, exactly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  No way (ph) beyond (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .are in his favor (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared, pretty -- pretty tough odds there.  Jared  Max, thank you.  You should catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News  Headlines 24/7 everyday or check him out on Sirius XM 115.  </p><p>Coming up next, hitting the breaks -- Uber seeing setbacks with the self- driving fleet after reports of traffic violations -- more on the  investigation next hour.

Welcome back.   Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo right  here in D.C.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump will address a joint session of  congress tonight for the first time as commander-in-chief.  The president  is expected to stress unity during his speech, however before taking the  stage the president blamed his predecessor for tensions in the country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that President Obama  is behind it because his people are certainly behind it.  And some of the  leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks which are  really very serious leaks because they're very bad in terms of national  security.  But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him  being behind things, that's politics, and it will probably continue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's speech tonight, the address begins at 9:00 pm Eastern and we  will be there live with analysis for you right after.  A miraculous story  of survival, a small plane crashes into a home killing three people but a  cheerleader onboard is alive this morning.  The details coming up.  Target  shares sinking in premarket this morning, the retail admits expectations on  both revenue and earnings.</p><p>The stock is plummeting down 13 percent, we will break down the numbers  coming up.  And Oh Snap, the parent company of Snapchat expected debut on  Wall Street Thursday.  What you need to know ahead of the highly  anticipated IPO in environment where we haven't seen a lot of IPOs.   Meanwhile, it could be a record day on Wall Street today.  Take a look at  futures indicating a flat opening this morning, this has been the situation  every morning and yet at the end of the day we see another record-high  close.  Another gain today would be a 13th record close in a row that is  never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.</p><p>In Europe this morning stocks are searching for direction, take a look at  Eurozone indices with the FT 100 up just a fraction in the CAC Quarante.   And the DAX Index lower.  And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a  look, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the weakest link down 3/4 of 1  percent.  Well, a tweet maybe to blame for the for biggest mistake in Oscar  history  Plus the best picture snafu not only thing plaguing the years'  award shows.  The details after Hollywood's big night delivers a ratings  bomb.</p><p>All of those stories coming up.  And joining me this morning to talk all  about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's  global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Fox News Contributor, Rachel  Campos-Duffy.  Good to see you.</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show so far you guys.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.  A lot of  excitement building up before the president gives his second big speech.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you've been great in terms of really outlining what's  important tonight.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  More spending on military, more spending on  infrastructure, less spending on domestic programs and importantly, the  state department outreach to rest of the world, America first.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen?  You're absolutely right.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And don't forget, we're going to all be  looking to see what Melania Trump is wearing tonight.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's important.  That's important. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And also that President Trump is not going to touch Medicare or  Social Security which was something that he said on the campaign trail but  to people worried about the national debt and the looming tidal wave of the  tsunami of the entitlement programs.  I think that that's of note and of  concern.  And by the way, I still want to point out that if this president  and this congress gets bogged down in the repeal and replace of Obamacare  and you start getting toward the end of 2017, with a tax reform, that's  going to be not good news for the markets.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's why, you know, we're talking about the market  potentially a record 13th straight day of increases is -- at some point the  market is going to stay -- is going to ask is it delivering, are we -- are  we getting what he -- what he promised?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And a lot of hangs in the balance.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about that this morning. Joining the  conversation, former chief of staff under President Clinton, Mack McLarty  is with us this morning.  President George W. Bush's former undersecretary  of defense for policy, Doug Feith is with us and the host of Varney and  Company, Stuart Varney will weigh in as well.  We got a big program ahead.   So just stay with us for this hour.  We kick it off right now with our top  story and that is the president set to outline this is agenda tonight on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  During his  address to a joint session of congress tonight.  Peter Barnes is live at  the White House right now with the details.  Peter, good morning to you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning,  Maria.  That's right.  We got more details from the president aides about  tonight's speech, they say the president will talk about his  accomplishments during his first month or so here in office including those  executive orders and possibly talks about companies, about keeping and  creating jobs in the United States, he will also discuss that range of  issues that you just mentioned.  And maybe he'll take a little credit for  the stock market and those recent records he did on Fox and Fiends this  morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  You take a look at what's going on with the stock market, trillions  of dollars of value have been created since I won election, I mean  trillions, and -- in fact it was very interesting on Friday, it looked like  for the first time in 11 or 12 sessions the market might go down a little  bit and it was down, down, down, it was like 15 seconds left and all of a  sudden it shut up.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Now, the big initiative he'll discuss tonight of course is his  plan to ask congress for $54 billion in additional spending on defense, his  aides say that the 10 percent increase, defense stocks have been up on that  news and administration official also saying the broad theme of the speech  tonight is the renewal of the American spirit and an optimistic vision for  all Americans, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you so much.  Peter Barnes with the  latest there.  I want to bring in Mack McLarty right now, he is former  chief of staff under President Clinton.  Mack it's good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p>MACK MCLARTY, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Maria, always  good to be with you.  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you want to hear from the President tonight.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  I'd like to hear really, first, the concrete outline of what he's  going to do, I think the speech will be more positive.  I think he will  call for unity, how that proceeds, we'll have to wait and see.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, what -- let me -- look, we know roughly speaking that he  wants to increase military spending, we know that roughly speaking he wants  to come out with a tax plan and repeal and replace Obamacare, are you  onboard with those initiatives? </p><p>MCLARTY:  Not totally.  I think he will lay out his framework, you know,  the president proposes the congress disposes, and so he will lay out his  framework, it will work its way through the congress and the various  committees.  I think there's already been concern expressed about the very  substantial increase in the military budget.  We all want to support our  troops, we've had 15 years of war, equipment been depleted, there's no  question.</p><p>On the other hand is someone who had the privilege to work with president,  who did balance the budget.  I am concerned about the budget and the impact  there and you even have the military speaking about not weakening the state  department.  It's essentially we have soft diplomacy and engagement as well  as strong military power.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Jon?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Can we talk about the White House, you ran a White House,  there is a lot of different factions in this White House, we have -- we  have budget hawks, we have the populous wing of Bannon, we have  nationalists, what is your read of how this -- how this White House is  operating and the factions there, is it any different than anything you --  that you saw when you running the White House?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, lift-offs are always a challenge in any White House and  President Trump came from outside, Governor Clinton came from being a  governor.  After 12 years the republicans being in office, but I think  Reince Priebus is capable, first, he knows Washington, there are always  power senators in Washington.  This is not unique to Trump administration  but they need to prioritize and get a handle on what they're doing and move  forward with their plan not unlike what Maria just outlined on the speech  and this is a  good evening to do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And are they all in line do you think?  I mean, when you look  at what the priorities are from counselors around him to his Chief of Staff  Reince Priebus?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, Maria, a couple of points.  I think you want different  points of view in any White House, any president wants different or CEOs or  whatever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't want yes men around.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  But the -- but the challenge for Chief Priebus is to be an honest  broker, and it's the same thing with the national security advisor to take  those different views, put them in a form that gives the president the  option to making decision and then close on a decision.  That's what  important in any platform.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How will the democrats going to treat -- </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, we were talking about that earlier, I hope carefully and  nimbly, I mean, if he calls for more jobs, do you stand and applaud for  that or not?  And so it's going to be tricky for them, I think they need to  pick their disagreements so to speak very carefully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you make a great point and it's a good question  because tonight we know that there will be protesters outside.  Tonight we  know that there will be guests of certain democrats who may actually, you  know, resist what the president's policies are.  How should President Trump  handle that?  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, he's had some practice at handling it during the campaign.   And it could play in his favour.  I hope though tonight, not to be  pollyannaish but I hope deny, I mean, it's a serious address about serious  issues.  It's a call for unity, it's a very serious thoughtful speech and  it's received in that manner.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think there are some dangers for the democrats in this, I  mean, some of the guests that they've invited are people we would expect  but there is talk that they may have given some of these extra tickets to  protesters who may jump up and we saw the reaction that, you know, when Joe  Wilson said, you lie, you know, I mean, people do expect the sense of  decorum and respect for the office of president and should something happen  that's very disruptive or disrespectful, you know, we see the numbers for  the -- whole numbers saying that the country is moving -- saying that we're  moving in the right direction, what happens to democrats if they just look  like the party of resistance of disruption, and just really trying to put a  stop to him even just getting off the ground and even with -- Barack Obama  looking like he's beating this maybe from a few miles away.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  I would take a little exception to your final point but I think  your other points were appropriately made and if you look at the  democratically governors, association and their comments, they made very  much -- as very much the same thing that you just echoed, we've got to be  for something else as democrats.  We got to before a growth agenda, how are  we going to get this economy moving that includes everybody.  So they just  can't be against President Trump.  They need to pick and pick their battles  very carefully.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do they have that?  I mean, is there something that they're  for other than being against Donald Trump?</p><p>MCLARTY:  Oh, I think you're seeing that emerge, Maria.  And I think it's  frankly, early in Trump administration and early in terms of the democrats  getting all of their programs together and moving forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You said -- you said you take issue with what Rachel just said.   I want to play you a sound bite from President Trump and he basically says  no, President Obama is behind some of this.  Listen to this.</p><p>MCLARTY:  OK.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it, I also think it's politics, that's the  way it is and look I have a -- </p><p>BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  But bush wasn't going  after Clinton, Clinton wasn't going after bush.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Well, you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes,  you know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  You  know, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people is  certainly are behind it.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  is it -- is it a stretch to say that his people are behind the  protesters and loyalists to President Obama?</p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, I think there is some natural disagreement from people that  supported President Obama or perhaps when President Obama's administration.   I think President Trump said you never know is probably the key phrase but  to say I think and suggest that President Obama is personally engaged, I  don't think there is any real evidence to suggest that's the case. </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's definitely encouraged it through statements that he  made and I would say that it's -- I don't think we should normalize a  president -- an ex-president not really sort of giving the new president a  chance to -- I mean this is a highly unusual the level of involvement and I  mean, most presidents sort of recede into background.  </p><p>MCLARTY:  Well, President Bush certainly did and President Clinton did  although President Trump has been pretty critical of President Obama, so in  this counter punching narrative that President Trump has put forward, you  could -- you could say that but I don't expect President Obama to be  actively engaged.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So tonight, it will be a success if? </p><p>MCLARTY:  If one --it's a positive speech as kind of -- as of kind of a  Ronald Reaganess or Bill Clintoness, positive view, let's move forward  together and it has some specific and it -- that at least have some  possibility for common ground of bipartisan support.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Mack, good to see you.</p><p>MCLARTY:  We'll see.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Mack McLarty there, Fox  Business is taking you live to the president's joint address to congress  tonight 9:00 pm Eastern, so stay with us as we have a full coverage  tonight.</p><p>Coming up.  We will Snapchat and will company have a picture-perfect debut  on Wall Street, new details on Snap's hotly anticipated IPO.  Target stocks  sinking in the premarket down 13 percent after disappointing fourth  quarter, a closer look at the company's earnings.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane crashing into two houses in  Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So, Maria fire officials say one  teenager was thrown from a backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl  only had minor injuries.  Three people were killed when the aircraft  crashed shortly after taking off from Riverside Municipal Airport.  The  cell phone video caught the moment of the crash, you can see huge flames  and thick smoke following that explosion.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the backhouse of the neighbors, they're exiting an elderly man,  exiting firefighters were taking people to safety.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on that plane.   They were flying home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  </p><p>Well, analysts at UBS say the Costco may boost their membership fee in the  next few months.  UBS putting out a note to investors saying the warehouse  chain fees for basic membership likely going to increase by $5 that means  it will be $60.  UBS is the fee for a Costco executive membership going to  rise by 10, they will make it 120 every year.  It affirms that Costco might  announce those hikes on Thursday when they release a second quarter  earnings.</p><p>Costco recently did increase their membership fees by 10 percent in other  countries, they did it in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico even the U.K.   Costco has not confirmed it but during an earnings call in December, the  CEO said the time might be actually ripe for that fee hike, so we'll see on  Thursday.  Well, President Donald Trump preparing to address a joint  session of congress for the first time tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming up.  We have to  understand Obamacare has been a disaster.  It's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border and remember  this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting the bad ones  out, the bad people.  Gang members, druglords, and some cases murderers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  And the president also we should say expected to declare early  progress on his campaign promises.  Well, let's take a look at Target  shares, they're being hit pretty hard this morning guys.  The company  reported sales and earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.  Target  was hurt by a disappointing holiday quarter, we talking about it this  morning.  There is the stock.  Earnings came in buck 45 a share, they  missed the estimate 1.51, they also said the outlook for fiscal year 2017  is also, Maria, going to miss analysts expectation.  So it was about the  holiday quarter certainly the retailers under pressure because of folks  like Amazon.  And those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure that's it.  Tough quarter for Target.  Thank you  so much, Cheryl.  And we are back with our panel, Dagen McDowell, Jon  Hilsenrath, Rachel Campos-Duffy.  Tonight, the big night.  First time we'll  hear from the president since inauguration day, Rachel.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Absolutely.  And, you know, this is the prime time address.   It's not in the middle of the day, expect huge ratings, expect them to talk  about these ratings especially with -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  God, you're right.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  -- the Oscar ratings down, I think he's going to take a lot  of pleasure in seeing his own ratings going up.  This guy knows how to do a  show, he's very unpredictable.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think it's going to be very interesting, I know I  mentioned Melania and Ivanka in what they're going to wear, listen, this is  a huge rebound of the image for the republican party, highly fashionable  women.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think -- I think it's -- I think this is the real moment  for the republicans.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's two things on that we're looking at.  One is, there's  going to be so much attention in who's in the gallery above all these  dignitaries down on the floor.  So much talk about who the democrats are  inviting, who republicans are inviting.  I think we're going to hear more  about that that than we usually do.  That's one thing.  The other thing,  something we've been talking about all morning, Maria is immigration, what  is the president's stand on immigration.  You've been distinguishing -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  We know where it stands on immigration.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  No, no.  But this is -- but this is the important point  between legal and illegal immigration.  If we're going to hit growth  targets of three percent or more, we actually need more legal immigration  and not less of it because the population is aging and --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- because we have all these baby boomers retiring.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  The barrier has always been the wall and that's what -- and  border security.  So, if you want immigration reform, you first have to  secure the border and I think that's something -- he's a populist because  that's actually very popular to secure our border and getting out violent  criminals and other very popular.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very popular.  Absolutely.  Dagen, I mean, look, we have been  talking about differentiating legal from illegal because in some of the  circles here, particularly the democrats bringing their guest tonight,  they're confusing it.  I mean, as if the president doesn't want legal  immigration.  I mean, has he said he doesn't want legal -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That -- this has been the opportunity for him to make that  distinction of the liberals and the democrats always talk about immigration  as a whole, that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about  securing the homeland period.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  Still ahead President Trump seeks to  beef up the nation's military.  Meanwhile, the defense spending increase  expected in the White House as first fiscal budget.  That budget will be  out in the next week.  And then, the biggest technology IPOs since  Facebook.  Everything you need to know about Snap's hotly anticipated Wall  Street debut this week.  Back in a moment.  .  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Wall Street gears up for one of the biggest  intelligent IPOs in years, Snap, the parent company Snapchat however is not  expected to follow the same path as other social media giants that have  gone public like Facebook and Twitter.  Unlike other Silicon Valley giants,  Snap does not have a headquarters and its cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel is  an unconventional leader, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Jon  Hilsenrath here today, taking a look at it.  How will the Snap's IPO you  think be different than Facebook.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, our story today is all about the unusual  leadership of Snap CEO who is not a very open communicative person, doesn't  like to have big meetings with his -- with his staff.  So, I think there's  going to be some questions about management, how is -- how is management  going to run the company.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I tell you one thing that he got right, not to sell for  $3 billion back in the day, right?  Who offered $3 billion and then -- and  remember the -- oh, this is just crazy.  Why would you not sell?  You just  offered $3 billion and here he is with a $20 plus billion IPO.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he's engaged to Miranda Kerr, the actress who's Orlando  Bloom former homegirl if you will.  So there you go.  So we know that about  him, there might be a lose but he's got a model on his arm.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think it's a -- it's a big test for Wall Street because this  is our first big tech IPO in a while and, you know, we have to see if Wall  Street really embraces this like the Facebook.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think that's a great point because this is not a good IPO  period right now.  It is not a lot of I big deals.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It hasn't been but Wall Street is on fire now.  So if we get a  very hot IPO out of Snap and it could be something that adds a little  momentum.  </p><p>CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  I'll tell you who's embracing it, it is young people, I  mean, my teens are on, you know, they love this stock.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But how loyal will they be two years from now, even two months  from now. </p><p>CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  They move on to another thing.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Look at this.  Is it -- is it Facebook or is it Twitter  is going to be big question --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- to buy the IPO -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But Rich Peterson, it has to be capitalized uses, looks as if  February 2017 will be the lowest monthly count of IPOs since March when --  of '16 when just four IPOs price.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And how o do you reconcile that with the fact that -- look at  -- look at the NASDAQ, look how high it is, you know, you would think in a  market like this that more companies will be coming out in IPOing, so if  you get a good one out of Snap then you might see some others following  behind it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I wondered why because normally you want to go public when the  markets are rallying and when it's really strong performance and yet you're  just not seeing that.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And maybe it's a sign that this momentum we're  seeing in the market is not sustainable.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But we'll see, I mean, look, the markets are waiting for tax  reform, right, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we will be talking about this forever here, but we're up 13  percent since election day.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And you've also seen the bonds rising along with stocks  which is unusual, so somebody is wrong in that equation, either gross loss  either or risky assets, you know, risk your assets.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We had a story in the paper just yesterday about how a better  reversal, we're starting to see people buying bonds again which is another  --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right.  I said bonds rising.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  Prices are rising, yields are falling which is a sign  that maybe people are starting to question the kind of growth that --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Hey, I read the journal, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Oh, I know.  I know you do.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And she's been talking about that for some time as well.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, building a better defense,  President Trump's pledge to increase military spending.  Where the money  will come to from to pay for it.  And then a bigger buyout of Apple, why  Warren Buffet is doubling down on Apple shares.  Back in a moment. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, this morning in Washington.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump, set to  address the Joint Session of Congress tonight, for the first time since  taking office.  The Commander in Chief is expected to address many issues,  including taking care of our veterans.  Earlier in the program I spoke with  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, about his role so far. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  I've been in government now  about 18 months, that's long enough to understand how this system works and  where the problems are.  And my discussions with the President have been  that we have to make these changes quickly, and being able to know where  the problems are, is going to allow us to do that as quick as we need to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  address tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, join are us throughout the day today,  for full analysis as well.  As the President prepares to address Congress,  his Cabinet is one step closer to being complete.  The Senate confirming  Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, in a 72 to 27 vote last night.  He will  be sworn into office this morning.  Target shares are sinking in the pre- market, the retailer missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per  share.  We have breaking down numbers, coming up. </p><p>Warren Buffett, meanwhile, taking a big bite out of Apple: why the  billionaire invertor's betting big on Apple shares?  And it could be a  record day on Wall Street, Futures indicating: markets will open like this.   We are off of the highs and certainly, we're pretty flat to the -- to the  break-even line.  If we do see a record today, because this has been the  case open: we open lower, and then by the end of the day, close higher.   The gain would be a 13th record close, in a row, that has never happened in  the Dow's 120-year history.  </p><p>We're just getting breaking news right now; fourth quarter GDP is out.  The  fourth quarter grew at a rate of 1.9 percent, this is the second estimate;  this is below expectations.  The estimate calls for growth of 2.1 percent.   The GDP hitting the tape right now: markets, as you see, are reacting.  In  Europe, stocks are searching for direction this morning, take a look at  Eurozone indices and you will see fractional moves up in London and in  Paris, but even the DAX Index actually has turned positive.  The European  markets are actually, trading higher even if just by a fraction.  </p><p>And in Asia, overnight, markets were mixed, take a look, the big loser  there was the Hang Seng in Hong Kong: down three quarters of one percent.   Well, a picture of Kellyanne Conway, goes viral, but will the White House  take the criticism sitting down?  We'll talk about that picture, that's  going viral.  Plus, a tweet maybe to blame, a tweet for the biggest mistake  in Oscar history.  Why the man in charge, of the envelopes, may have been  more concerned with social media, and sending out tweets and pictures than  handing over the right envelope.  Our top story this half hour, President  Trump focusing on defense.  Trump is seeking a historic $54 billion  increase in defense spending, while pursuing cuts everywhere else.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  40 days, after his inauguration, President Trump and  Republican Congress will have -- not lifted a finger to create jobs, raise  wages for hardworking American families.  These actions will worsen the  conditions that fueled his candidacy, President Trump engaged in a bait and  -- a bait and switch agenda: no jobs, no retirement security, and no health  security.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.  I just want to point out that he is seeking cuts  elsewhere, but not everywhere else, pardon me on that.  Joining us right  now is the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, under Bush 43,  Doug Feith is with us.  Under Secretary, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p>DOUG FEITH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE FOR POLICY UNDER SECRETARY UNDER GEORGE  W. BUSH:  Glad to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  So, the President says, he wants the U.S. to be  better prepared if called to fight.  What's your take on these expectations  that he wants to raise military spending by $54 billion? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, the defense budget was pretty severely slashed throughout the  Obama administration, and the Unites States continues to have large  worldwide defense responsibilities.  But we have not had a budget in recent  years that allow us to -- that allows us to actually, have the kind of  military capabilities that would allow to us fulfill responsibilities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you want to see this?  You want to see more spending on  military then?  </p><p>FEITH:  I do.  I think it's an important thing, I think that we have large  parts of our infrastructure.  There -- recently, there've been some  attention paid to how our nuclear infrastructure for example, has  deteriorated greatly.  That's enormously dangerous, if countries around the  world that have depended on Unites States for decades, for their security  because of our nuclear umbrella?  Begin to worry about the integrity of our  nuclear umbrella, because we haven't been investing enough.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>FEITH:  That's -- that makes for a much more dangerous world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure does.  Dagen?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration's proposal will take the defense budget  to $603 billion, that's still short of say, what a Senator John McCain  wants, which is closer to $640 billion.  Do you think that the Trump  administration should do even more, in terms of increasing the defense  spending?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, there're a lot of details to be debated, but I think that  what Senator McCain has said, Representative Thornberry has said in the  House, have to be taken seriously.  That there's going to be a debate  between mysterious people in Congress that are looking to pitch on the  Armed Services Committees in the House, and the Senate, and the  administration, and I think there is a strong argument to be made that the  administration has not gone far enough.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's going to be a debate within Trump administration  too because Mick Mulvaney, who's the Budget Director, has been kind of a  deficit hawk.  And that's one of the reasons that Senator McCain didn't  trickily care for.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Well, and I think that people are perfectly happy with  seeing us upgrade airplanes, and our ships, and armor for our troops, but a  lot of people see that there's some fat to be cut in the Pentagon.  And so,  maybe, sort of being, in between where Barack Obama was, and not quite  where John McCain wants him to be, means that, you know, military will have  to find ways where they can streamline in, and do things more efficiently,  so they can, you know, meet budget cuts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can he do that?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, it's -- this is a perennial question.  It's always a good  idea to cut fat.  I don't think that you're going to be able to solve the  problem simply by cutting the fat.  The amount of -- the serious harm that  was done, by the see quest ration cuts throughout the Obama years needs to  be remedied.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that.  I mean, go through for us the more  important areas of the military where you believe need love, frankly?  I  mean, we've got the oldest navy in decades, oldest army in decades, how you  characterize and assess where we we're today, and what needs to be done? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I mean, I think you flag some of the major issues, the our --  our navy needs more platforms, we need more capabilities in basically all  of the services.  We have -- we have for example, in Asia, had a policy  that at the beginning of the Bush administration we said, the real  strategic interests of the Unites States, require us to build up our  capabilities in Asia.  Some work was done in that regard.  Then President  Obama came in, and made the point about pivoting to Asia, which was a way  of essentially reaffirming, that we need to do more to focus on our  strategic interests in Asia, because Asia is both economically and  strategically enormously important.  In order to do what we need to do in  Asia, we need long range military capabilities, that's air capabilities,  naval capabilities, and the like.  All of that is enormously expensive and  requires us to build up our forces.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Donald Trump has said that he's -- he's asking these other  countries that have been benefiting from our military expenditures to step  up.  So, is that going to reduce some of the financial pressure on us? </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I think that -- President Trump has said some things that I  think have some merit, and are also a problem.  </p><p>DUFFY:  OK.  </p><p>FEITH:  What he said that has merit is, what every American President in  basically since the cold war began, was saying, which is we would like  greater contributions from our allies.  That's another perennial debate.  </p><p>DUFFY:  But he seems to mean it, right?</p><p>FEITH:  Well, he has -- he has also said some things that I think were  really not constructive, and not accurate, about how some of our key allies  are free loaders.  I don't think that's a fair -- I don't think that's a  fair description.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Are you reassured by General Mattis, running the Defense  Department though?  Because he has gone against things that his boss,  President Trump has said, whether it's about torture, whether it's where  not taking Iraq's oil, whether it's standing by our NATO allies, does that  reassure you? </p><p>FEITH:  It does.  I think that General Mattis is understanding of the  importance of our alliances, is far more sound than the campaign rhetoric  that came from Mr. Trump, during the campaign, and even unfortunately some  of the things he said since he's been President.  But I hope that he -- I  hope that President Trump will take advice on what remains to be seen.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How has that comment about what you just said, free loaders?   How has that impacted our friends across the world?  </p><p>FEITH:  Well, I think -- I mean in my conversations with representatives  from a number of those countries, it has made them question whether  President Trump is going to continue to uphold the relationships, continue  to uphold the alliance obligations that we have.  And we -- I don't think  it is in our interests that we call those alliances into question.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What if -- what if some of them should be paying off, right?   How do get to do that? </p><p>FEITH:  As I said, it's been -- it has been a perennial problem that we've  encouraged and not always successfully, our allies to contribute more.  I  am happy to see that some of -- many of our allies are responding to Mr.  Trump by saying that they're going to increase their defense spending.   That's a positive thing, and I give -- I give President Trump credit for  that.  But, you know, this needs to be calibrated correctly to put the  pressure on the allies without making them question fundamentally, whether  we are going to remain true to our commitments.  </p><p>DUFFY:  It's definitely about that, but I can tell you that it really  resonates with the American people, when they hear Donald Trump tell them:  you have to care more about your liberty and freedom than we do.  And I  think that -- and Americans feel like, some of them are free loaders.  And  I don't know what a President can -- how do you strike that balance between  making them feel like, you know, we're not going -- we're not going to  leave you, that at the same time, putting enough pressure verbally on them.   At least, to get them to pay their fair share.  </p><p>FEITH:  You know, I see the -- I see the populist appeal of that kind of  rhetoric.  But I think it's very short sided because, what I am focused on,  is the interests of the American people.  It is not in our interests to  have our allies doubt our reliability.  That ultimately is not a way to  punish allies that you think are not contributing enough, we're going to be  punishing ourselves if we damage these alliances -- these alliances.  </p><p>And I really think that a responsible American official would be making  this clear to the American public.  These alliances, have kept the security  situation relatively quiet around a large part of the world, to be enormous  benefit of the American people.  It has created a platform on which an  enormous amount of economic growth has occurred, where trade occurs.  And  if we damage that general structure for security in the world, we are  damaging our own economy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, of course.  Great to have your insights, Doug.  Thanks so  much.  We appreciate you joining us today.  Under Secretary, Doug Feith,  joining us.  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  Joint Address to Congress tonight.  Join us, for our special coverage all  day, and leading up to the address at 9:00 p.m. tonight.  And we'll be live  here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to have full analysis tomorrow morning.</p><p>Coming up next, markets setting new records under President Trump, but the  mainstream media is focused on the backlash against the President.  Stuart  Varney, sounds off, has some thoughts on that, he's coming up.  Plus, a  Kellyanne Conway photo not sitting well with some of her critics.  Why a  picture of the White House Adviser is going viral this morning.  Back in a  moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are flat this morning although we are  expecting a couple of big movers.  Warren Buffett for example is taking a  bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stake in Apple is now  more than double what it was at the start of the year.  Berkshire now owns  133 million shares of Apple, it's up from 57 million.  It certainly made  money on that move.  Berkshire Hathaway stake is now about $18 billion.   Take a look at Apple shares right now at $137.05 a share in the premarket.</p><p>We're watching Amazon today.  Time Magazine reporting that the company is  working to give its voice assistance, Alexa, the ability to distinguish who  is talking to it.  The report says that the capability which is being  called Voice I.D., has been in development since 2015.  Amazon shares up  almost three percent this morning in the premarket. </p><p>Markets are poised for their 13th straight record breaking day.  But the  mainstream media seems to be giving the Trump rally the cold shoulder.  A  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, joins us from New York.  How do  you give this market the cold shoulder?  13 percent since Election Day, six  percent since the start of the year, Stu.  Wow.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\":  Yes.  And by the way, if we  close, just even one point higher today, it will be truly an historic event  on Wall Street because we've never seen 13 consecutive records in the 120- year history of the Dow Industrials.  Now, look at this, I've got the New  York Times.  I actually paid for a copy this morning, here it is.  It's not  on front page.  No mention of the Wall Street rally. The Trump rally, no  mention whatsoever on the front page.  So, I turned to the business  section.  It's called Business Day.  Not a single notion. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you kidding me? </p><p>VARNEY:  Not a mention.  You go to page B7, to find any mention of the  rally.  I'm looking for it -- fast here.  And it says, \"Wall street closes  at new highs again.\"  It's tucked down at the bottom corner of B7.  So  then, I splashed out big time, went to the Washington Post.  Here it is.   Not on the front page.  They do have an economy section on page eight.   Well what do you think the lead is in the Washington Post on this historic  day?  I will tell you, it is Apple shareholders all set to vote on whether  to force the company to make its leadership more diverse. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>I rest my case.  If this is not the dishonest media.  You know, this is  total dishonesty. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's only $3 trillion in market wealth that has been created.   What do you want?  A whole story on it?  It's only $3 trillion.</p><p>VARNEY:  A trillion here, a trillion there.  Pretty soon, you're talking  big money.  You know what I mean, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  I think so.</p><p>VARNEY:  Look, if people are not watching Fox Business, Maria, Stuart and  everybody else, they wouldn't know that history is being made in our  economy, on our markets, they would not know it.  100 million people will  benefit directly from what we've seen on Wall Street, no mention.   Dishonesty. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Transparency is the issue.</p><p>VARNEY:  My rant is over, OK.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right, no.  And there is the issue, you are not getting  the full story.  That's the point.  Stuart, thank you.  I know you have  more on this in about 10 minutes and we will see you then. </p><p>VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern.   Thank you. Stuart, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>Coming up next, ruining the Oscars in 140 characters or less.  Why Twitter  may be to blame for the Best Picture mix-up at the Academy Awards. </p><p>Then, critics claiming that Kellyanne Conway is not putting her best foot  forward in the oval office.  The picture of the White House Adviser going  viral this morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, get this if.  If photo of White House  Adviser, Kellyanne Conway, is going viral this morning, there's the photo.   Social media erupted after the picture emerged of Conway with her feet on a  couch in the Oval Office.  Joining us right now is political analyst,  Kirsten Haglund, to talk more about this.  Kirsten, good to see you first  of all. </p><p>KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ADVISOR:  Good to see you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us.  So, what do you think?  Are her critics  making a big deal out of nothing or does this bother you?</p><p>HAGLUND:  No, this is completely outrageous.  There is about 52,000 tweets  as of this morning about this particular incident.  You know what is just  sad is that it's such a really, really great meeting that's going on in the  Oval Office where that picture is being taken.  It's a meeting with  President Trump, as you can see, with leaders from historically black  colleges and universities.  It's just a really, really incredible thing and  they're shining the spotlight on something that really doesn't even matter.   And I should say, conservatives are quick to jump on President Obama when  he had photo taken of him in the Oval Office with a feet up on the desk or  his feet on the table next to couch.  This is political fodder, we expect  them to do.  But nothing's worse than what happened with Bill Clinton the  in oval office, so I think that people can give Kellyanne a break. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.  Do  we see that kind of reaction to the antics there with Bill Clinton and  Monica Lewinsky and then some?  But then again, Dagen, he put her feet on  the couch in the Oval Office.  How about some respect?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Momma McDowell would say, \"Don't put your feet on the  furniture.\" </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Particularly if it's the Oval Office.  The optics of this are  bad.  And President Trump understands optics better than anybody.  About --  I mean, he is a great showman that does not represent his administration  well.  I don't feel like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do we know if she has her shoes on or is she walking around  there? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think if you're -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  I don't know if her shoes are on.  She's clearly trying to take a  better picture.  There are White House photographers there.  She didn't  need taking that picture, she certainly doesn't need it.  I -- listen, I  hate saying this, I'm a big Kellyanne fun, but I have kids, I would be  furious if they sat like that at the neighbor's house, let alone in the  Oval Office. </p><p>FEITH:  Either has her shoes on or her shoes are on the couch. </p><p>HAGLUND:  Which is bad. </p><p>FEITH:  Worse is walking around the Oval Office with no shoes on.  Which is  also -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  Which is bad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, there is a lot of people there, right?  I mean,  this is like an important meeting happening. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's the head of historic black colleges.  That makes it that  much worse, so -- </p><p>HAGLUND:  Listen -- </p><p>FEITH:  It's disrespectful to them.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll cruise that both sides of the aisle.  And I don't think  that President Obama should have his feet on the desk and I don't think her  feet should be on this oval.</p><p>HAGLUND:  And I don't think my feet should also be in the Oval Office  either.  So, I think it's all bad. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's abridged, real far. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Totally agree.  What we want Kirsten, what about this.  We're  learning more about the big blunder, here around the world.  The wrong  movie awarded Best Picture at the Oscars.  So, here's what we know.  The  PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, he is to blame because just minutes  before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong envelope, he tweeted out  a photo of the Best Actress winner, Emma Stone, backstage.  </p><p>The award mix-up happened just three minutes later.  Now, Cullinan's  backstage tweets were reportedly not sanctioned by the Academy and he later  deleted the tweet along with other posts during the show.  So, what about  that Kirsten?  Do you think he deleted the tweets because he didn't want  people to think, \"You were focused on your tweets and you gave Warren  Beatty the wrong envelope,\" which is actually what happened.</p><p>HAGLUND:  Absolutely.  And I'm sure he didn't want PricewaterhouseCoopers  to find out as well.  You know, first I felt bad for this guy.  I thought,  \"Oh, don't publish his name.  Don't publish his photo.  He probably feels  awful already.\"  But then you see these pictures coming out and of course,  you know, you're backstage at a once in a lifetime opportunity, you want to  catch that shot and you want to post it but, you know, people get in  trouble with their posting.  </p><p>Do you know that in the last couple of years, there've been 127 deaths from  people trying to take selfies?  So, you know, we have to be really careful  with what we post, you know.  So, I mean, I originally felt bad for the guy  but you know, you're there to do your job.  You're paid to do one thing  right and look at what happened.  So, I don't think he'll be handing out  envelopes next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel bad for it because I know that when we're live on TV,  I'm over here and I want to get something that our guests said immediately  out.  I want to make sure my followers know what was just said on the show.   I tweeted out really quickly but the truth is, this is to make a big  mistake because you're focusing on too many things.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's your show, though.  It's your show.  That one will show.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  All right, Kirsten Haglund, good to see  you.  We'll be right back with the final thoughts from our All-Star panel,  right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks to our fantastic panel, see you all tomorrow everybody.   \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.

It is Tuesday, February 28th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>President Trump set to address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time since taking office.

Members of the House and Senate will not be the only ones in attendance.   Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will  join first lady Melania Trump at the address.</p><p>Lawmakers are also allowed to bring guests to the President's address.   Some House Democrats are using the opportunity to bring dreamers and other  guests who would be affected by President Trump's immigration policies.</p><p>Joining me right now are Tennessee Congresswoman Marcia Blackburn and Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan.  It's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p>REP. MARCIA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's a big night. First time we are hearing from the President  since inauguration day.  What do you make of what's happening in terms of  the guests, Congresswoman Blackburn?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Everyone has the opportunity to bring someone; usually get  someone from their district, ties in some way with policies and discussions  that are going on.  And I just hope everyone remembers they are there as a  guest of the House.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about you Congressman Ryan?  </p><p>REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  Oh, I think it's important to highlight, this has  been a tradition whether it's the President -- who the President invites,  who the first lady invites, who members of Congress invite.  We are  highlighting the fact that there will be hundreds of thousands if not  millions of people thrown off of their health care if there's a complete  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>And I think it's important to put faces to that policy issue and let people  look people in the eye and say, you're not going to be covered if we do a  straight repeal.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we should point out that the President was very clear.   The President said that there's not going to be any interruption and people  will not lose their health care, actually.  That's what the President was  very clear about.  So I don't know -- </p><p>RYAN:  There was a Republican plan that was also put forward that said that  potentially millions of people were going to be thrown off.</p><p>Now, let's go back to the campaign where Trump campaigned at almost every  rally, Marcia and said we are going to rip it up, we're going to throw it  away, we're going to repeal this thing immediately.  He talked for a year  about doing that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not that he would throw anyone off the plan.  </p><p>RYAN:  Well, you can't do both.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  Of course, you can do both.  </p><p>RYAN:  How?  What's the plan?  Tell us what the plan is.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  There is a way to go through this process and to make certain  that what we do is improve the options that are there.  And Tim, you know,  as well as I do, the goal is to make certain that everyone has access to  affordable health care.</p><p>Obamacare is imploding.  It's imploding and it is not affordable.  You can  look at the increase in the insurance rate.  You can talk to those that are  delivering health care and talk about the lack of reimbursement for the  care that is delivered.  And, Maria, the choice is, are you going to have a  system that implodes and have nothing?  Or are we going to fix this so that  there is access to affordable health care for all Americans.  That's the  choice.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And how do you attack this, Congressman, knowing that like in  places like Arizona we are seeing premium increases of 116 percent?   Families cannot afford this.  </p><p>RYAN:  Does it need tweak, fix?  I'm in.  Let's fix it.  There are  obviously issues with something this big, this comprehensive that will need  adjusted as we go, but the reality of it is when you talk about the  Medicaid expansion as John Kasich said on the weekend talk shows, the  governor of Ohio about how many hundreds of thousands of people -- about  700,000 in Ohio have benefited from the Medicaid expansion.  If you look at  the credits that are given to people to help them afford to be able to pay  for health care, those are essential elements of the health care.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you saying you don't want Obamacare touched?  Are you  saying you don't want Obamacare touched?</p><p>RYAN:  No, no, no.  I'm telling you we can fix it if there are undo premium  increases, if there are issues with competition.  How do we fix this?  Why  do we got to repeal it?  Why do you got to throw it out?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's too expensive it impacts economic growth.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p>RYAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's dismiss that real quick.  The  Congressional Budget Office -- hold on.  The Congressional Budget Office  said -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, I'm not going to let you get by with that.  I'm not going  to let you get by with that.</p><p>RYAN:  This will actually be -- no, no, no.  This is an important point.   You can't let this go unanswered.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your point?</p><p>RYAN:  The point is that the Congressional Budget Office said in the first  10 years that the Affordable Care Act actually brings down the deficit by  $100 plus billion; in the second ten years it's over a trillion dollars of  deficit reduction on the health care. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think we should have a plan for 20 years and just wait  until it actually -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RYAN:  This isn't an either-or.  I don't know why it has to be an either- or.  We're all adults here.  Any other situation in your life is an either- or.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Here are the numbers.  If you have 22 million people in what is  the Obamacare realm, you have 11 million people, 12 million people that are  in the Medicaid expansion.  But then when you look at the exchange -- nine  million people, two million people can afford the product without a  subsidy, only two million people.  Seven million people can't afford it  unless they're getting a subsidy.  It is too expensive to afford.</p><p>Now, the other kicker in this is when people get it, you know, what they  say, we can't use it because the deductibles are so high, it's structurally  flawed.  It does not work.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  The deductibles are very (inaudible) that you're always  paying out of your pocket.  You could never actually reach that level.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  It turns out to be major medical.  </p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Can I just ask a quick  question?  So we saw some of the problems with Obamacare over the last four  years -- six years.  There were bills out to help fix some of these  problems.  Where were the Democrats in the fixes over the last five, six  years that the Republicans were putting forward?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good question.  </p><p>RYAN:  That's a very ironic question and the fact that they tried to do a  straight repeal.  How many votes?  60 something.  </p><p>DUFFY:  Some of those bills -- </p><p>RYAN:  And there was throughout the whole process of actually trying to put  it together, we got no cooperation from the Republicans at all.  We could  have very easily -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  60 percent of the people didn't want it.  60 percent of the  people didn't want it.  It was pretty clear the President basically went  around structures and pushed it through even though poll after poll showed  that people didn't want it.  </p><p>RYAN:  What structures.  It was the House and the Senate that voted on it.   All I'm saying is the Republicans fought this the entire way through.  If  we -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because their constituents didn't want it.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, they didn't even know what it was at that point.  And if they  were --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well Nancy Pelosi said let's pass it and then read it later.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  And then it gave the authority -- 1,400 times in that 2,300- page bill, it gives the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  Why did they do that?  Because they didn't want those items in  statute; they wanted to be able to go in and manipulate the system.  </p><p>RYAN:  Marcia -- that is such a misrepresentation of the process.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, it is not a misrepresentation.</p><p>RYAN:  There's nothing that we passed over here that we don't send to  executive branch and say you have to make rules for this.  You have to -- </p><p>BLACKBURN:  1,400 times of rules -- that's one of the -- </p><p>RYAN:  It's the American healthcare system.  You guys try to simplify this  and you're doing a disservice to the American people.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  That is incorrect.</p><p>RYAN:  This is a complicated issue.  Sit at the table and be a part of the  solution.  And you guys -- </p><p>Blackburn:  And we just tried to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the President didn't sit out at the table and try to be -- </p><p>RYAN:  He reached out to the Republicans through the entire process.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.</p><p>RYAN:  He couldn't get one Republican to sit and try to be a part of this. BARTIROMO:  You were there, did he reach out?  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.  And then Energy and Commerce Committee,  Healthcare subcommittee where we did this, of course.  We have tried to  bring forward things that will improve the delivery of health care, that  will solve the problems whether it's reimbursement with CMS, whether it's  the 1115 waiver system.  And no, were we met with open arms from those on  the White House and the administration?  Absolutely not.</p><p>RYAN:  This is the biggest rewrite of history I've ever seen in my life.   The Republicans had no interest.  They used this as a political issue from  day one.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, there was a reason -- with all due respect --  there was a reason Donald Trump won the presidency.  The American people  were frustrated.  And they were upset by what was going on in Washington.   They were upset by the executive orders.  It probably was as much about  Barack Obama as it was about Hillary Clinton.  Do you agree with that?   That's the reason Donald Trump won?  </p><p>RYAN:  Barack Obama had a jobs' bill at the Congress for years.  He kept  trying to work with Republicans.  Look, don't take my word for it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  His priority was health care.  He pushed health  care through.  </p><p>RYAN:  Let's provide context for the viewer.  Mitch McConnell said my sole  responsibility is to make Barack Obama a one-term president.  That was the  top Republican in the Senate.  And from that comment and the behavior of  the Republicans in the House not working with the President, not working  with Democrats saying we are going to use this opportunity that the people  have given us to shut Barack Obama down and the Democrats.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that because -- </p><p>RYAN:  They weren't part of the process.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- he kept going around them, doing executive orders.</p><p>RYAN:  He went around them -- he went around them after that.  He went  around them after that after they showed no willingness to work.  And now  all of a sudden -- now all of a sudden every Republican in America -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DUFFY:  Now we are at the state of the Union, this joint session of  Congress we see this #Resist attitude coming, so are the Democrats going  look at what they perceive the Republicans did in terms of obstructing  Obama's agenda?  And are they going to say, we are going to do it  differently, we are going reach across the aisle, we're going to help the  country move forward for sure?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that?  What about that?</p><p>RYAN:  To be determined, I think.  Many of us including me, myself has said  from the very beginning, he's elected president, we should try to work with  him.  He did nothing in -- Maria, he campaigned on jobs, the economy, he  was going to open up the steel mills.  He was going to reopen the coal  mines and put people back to work.  Here we are, how many weeks later,  where is the trillion-dollar transportation bill? </p><p>Why would you pick -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  With all due respect it's been a month.  It's been a month.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, within a month, the Obama -- within a month we had -- we had  the stimulus bill passed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well you were in massive recession and it was like of urgent  need.  </p><p>RYAN:  Well, people in Youngstown voted for him because they are still in a  massive recession.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The point is though tonight a number Democrats are going to be  bringing legal immigrants here.  I don't understand why the grandstanding.   Why not go to the speech with your sleeves rolled up, ready to work, and  get the people's business done? </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's the type of attitude that we would love to see.  </p><p>RYAN:  This is a complete reversal when President Obama was in, Marcia.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BLACKBURN:  No, it is not because -- </p><p>RYAN:  It's a complete reversal.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  -- there are so many times that we have brought good-solid  ideas to the table.  There are times, remember when -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows Harry Reid got in the middle of everything and  stopped any legislation.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  That's right, 400 bills.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows that.  </p><p>BLACKBURN:  And what we are saying is, come on, guys, there're things that  are on the table.  We need to get these done.  Let's get them to the  President's desk.</p><p>It is time to get this country moving again.  The American people voted for  us.  That is s why Donald Trump is president.  So let's bring our best  efforts to bear.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The people want you guys to work together.  You know that.</p><p>BLACKBURN:  Yes, they do.</p><p>RYAN:  You're the President, you set the tone.  Pick the issues that you  know are going to unify the country.  Pick the transportation bill,  trillion dollars, Davis-Bacon, broadband in every corner of the country.   We want to see -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And military spending -- it looks like the public wants an  increase in military spending.  That's according to the polls.</p><p>RYAN:  Well, we do.  We do -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>RYAN:  Let's do it, Marcia -- you and I should do that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.</p><p>RYAN:  But I think we do need to rebuild the military. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman Ryan and Congresswoman Blackburn -- thank you.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We are live from our nation's capital for President Trump's  address to a joint session of Congress tonight.</p><p>It is a gorgeous sunrise behind me.  Take a look.  We are enjoying this  beautiful day here in Washington.</p><p>Meanwhile a top executive of Uber who recently joined the company from  Google has resigned. </p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details and back story there.  Cheryl -- over to  you.</p><p>CASONE:  I've got the story, not the sunrise though here in New York City  like you've got, Maria.</p><p>So Amit Singhal resigned from Uber for not disclosing a sexual harassment  charge at his former employer that was first reported by Recode.  Singhal  denies he sexually harassed anyone while he was at Google where he was the  head of Search.  Uber has been dealing with charges of discriminatory and  sexist behavior at their company.  Singhal joined Uber in January from  Google and his senior (ph) role in maps and to advise on Uber's self- driving technology.</p><p>Well, speaking of self-driving Uber cars, the \"New York Times\" reporting  those cars missed at least six red lights and that had nothing to do with  human error, as Uber first said they did.  Problems with the mapping  program is to blame on that incident.</p><p>Well, careful what you say around your kids toys.  Hackers recently exposed  the conversations of nearly a million owners of Cloud Pets.  They make  those stuffed cats, dogs or rabbits for kids that you can use to talk to  your kids with.  Well, the animals are supposed to deliver messages that  you record via an app on your phone.  Well many of those recording ended up  in the hands of hackers as did passwords and e-mails.  Security experts say  it's warning the parents that have these pets to be aware of what they're  giving their children especially if they are using Cloud Pets, by the way.</p><p>Well, SpaceX wants to send humans into deep space; the company owned by  Elon Musk already delivers cargo to the space station for NASA.  Now they  hope to begin taking tourists around the moon within two years.  SpaceX  says it has already accepted a significant deposit from two unidentified  private citizens who want to fly around the moon.  The tourist flight would  last about a week and this would come after SpaceX begins (inaudible)  taking NASA astronauts up to the International Space Station and back.</p><p>Hope they enjoy that trip.  I will be watching from the ground -- Maria.   And those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much-- Cheryl.  </p><p>President Trump meeting with lawmakers and business leaders to jumpstart  his number one priority, the task of repealing and replacing Obamacare.   We'll take a look at that.</p><p>Plus what else is on the President's agenda for tonight's big speech.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, you are the big ones.   You are the biggest of the big -- right.  That's very impressive.  Thank  you for being here.</p><p>We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that  Obamacare has had and we are going the change it and straighten it out.   And we have a plan that's going to be, I think, fantastic.  It'll be  released fairly soon.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking during a meeting yesterday  with the CEO's of the country's largest health insurance.</p><p>Joining us right now is the former chief of staff under Bush 43 and the  president and CEO of the Business Roundtable -- Josh Bolten joining us now.   Josh -- good to see you.</p><p>JOSH BOLTEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>First off, give us your expectations for the big speech tonight.  What  should President Trump be thinking in terms of what's most important as you  have seen this before being the chief of staff?  What do you think he's  going to be front and center and where he should focus?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Well, every state of the union or this is a quasi-state of the  union should give the President an opportunity to set priorities.  From the  standpoint of the business community and from the standpoint of the whole  U.S. economy, the most important thing the President can do is really get  the ball rolling on three key priorities -- tax reform, regulatory reform,  and investment in infrastructure.</p><p>There's a tremendous opportunity sitting right there for the Republican  Congress for the President.  This is the time to really get the momentum  going for those priorities.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I agree with you.  Are you comfortable with the timing  that the President has laid out because so far we are looking at tax reform  now really having a bigger impact in 2018 as opposed to this year?</p><p>We had Steven Mnuchin on this program yesterday who was very clear that we  are not going see a real plan probably until the summer time, August.  </p><p>BOLTEN:  You know, we would like to see it move as fast as possible.   Secretary Mnuchin is right that it's going to be hard to have a plan  actually implemented before 2018.  But the whole business community would  like to see tax reform done as rapidly as possible in 2017.  But they've  got a lot on their plate.  They need to work it through</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What kind of an impact do you expect tax reform to have on  economic growth?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  If it's a good tax reform and by good I mean a tax reform that  substantially lowers corporate rates to an internationally competitive  level and a tax reform that shifts us toward a territorial system of  taxation.  If it's that kind of tax reform, it'll have a huge impact on the  economy.  It's an enormous opportunity because we have kept our economy  shackled by a way outdated tax system.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not only that but shackled by an enormous amount of regulation.   So you've got this rollback of regulation happening alongside the tax  reform.  How important is that?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Huge also.  That portion is already under way.  The administration  has taken some really important steps both in terms of process and  addressing specific regulations that are tying up business unnecessarily.</p><p>We can protect our health, our safety, our environment without  unnecessarily making it so difficult for the businesses in America to  create jobs and they are on the way to doing that although that'll be  rolling out over the course of the year.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Josh -- let me ask you.  And I want to ask you about your  Business Roundtable new job as well -- congratulations on that.  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me take you back to when you were the chief of staff, what  do you recommend the President do if he gets interrupted tonight?  If there  are people who are protesting -- we know that Rosie O'Donnell is expected  to be outside leading a protest.  We know that a lot of Democrats are  taking guests who are immigrants or trying to make a point of the  diversified country that we love.  What should President Trump do in that  regard?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Rise above.  This is the moment to be presidential.  Campaign is  over, now the country wants to come together behind one president.</p><p>You know, I think the vast majority of the country, whether they voted for  President Trump or not, want to see him succeed and now is his opportunity  to be really presidential and lead the country towards some of the  priorities that I just mentioned.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As you take on this new role what's your priority at the  Business Roundtable?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  Tax, that is huge for the companies that are members of the BRT.   We have 200 CEOs who participate in it.  They represent some of the biggest  companies in the United States, employ 15 million people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are they happy with President Trump?  </p><p>BOLTEN:  You know, they are very excited about the opportunity that his  changes in policies might pose -- the tax reform, the regulation, the  infrastructure.  That's why you see so much bounce in the stock market and  you feel it among the members of the BRT as well.  They think there's a  great opportunity here and tonight is the opportunity for the President to  really get that ball rolling.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Josh -- we'll be watching  what you do as well at the Business Roundtable.  Thank you.</p><p>BOLTEN:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Josh Bolten joining us there.</p><p>We've got more ahead.  The President's plan to strengthen the military.   Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin joins me next live right here.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with special coverage of  President Trump's address to the joint of congress, live from Washington  D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Among the issues tonight to be discussed,  defense.  The president expected to call for a massive increase in spending  to defend our country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget.   Very much based on those two and plenty of other things but very strong.   It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the  depleted military of the United States of America.</p><p>We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.

Eastern, so stay with us right  here as we have full analysis and live coverage tonight.</p><p>Will President Trump look to the past for inspiration?  We will bring you  some of the top moments from previous president's first addresses to  congress.</p><p>Coming up this morning.  One stop to watch, today target shares are  plummeting in the free market.  The retailer missed expectations when a  reported revenue and earnings this morning.  The stock is down almost 13  percent.  We are breaking down the numbers to give you backstory on target.</p><p>And it could be a record day on Wall Street nonetheless.  Take a look at  markets here, really trading right around the flat line.  A gain today  would be a 13th record close in the row for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.</p><p>In Europe meanwhile, stocks are searching for direction.  Take a look at  the European indices and you will see most of the average is lower but just  by a fraction.</p><p>And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Take a look at Asian markets  where the Hong Kong Hang Seng index was the loser down three quarters of  one percent.</p><p>The headache continues this morning for Samsung.  The details as the heir  to the brand is indicted on bribery charges.</p><p>And move over TV.  The massive amount of video we are all watching on  YouTube could lead traditional in the dust.  We'll tell you about the  amazing amount of video people are watching.</p><p>Talk about a seal of approval.  The adorable hug that's going viral this  morning.  We'll bring you that.</p><p>But first, our top story this half hour keeping America safe.  President  Donald Trump will seek an additional $54 billion in spending for the  Department of Defense tonight when he makes his speech in front of  congress.</p><p>Yesterday, the commander-in-chief hinted at his plans for the military  budget before he addresses the joint session of congress tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild  the depleted military of the United States of America at a time when most  needed.</p><p>We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to bring in Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.   And secretary Shulkin, it is great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p>DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  Thank you.  It's great to be  here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  You have so many accolades to discuss.  You're the  sole Obama appointee in this administration.  You were confirmed  unanimously.  People were saying, oh, this is an easy one.  You have been  at the Veterans Affairs, even though the president have said how bad the VA  has been.</p><p>He kept somebody who was there at the VA.  So you've got a great legacy as  you come into this job.  What do you expect to hear from the president  tonight?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, what I'd expect to hear is the strong support for making  sure that we're caring for our men and women who have served our country.   There's a commitment there and that hundred to zero both from the U.S.  congress is not so much about me.  It's really the country's commitment to  making sure that we do everything that we can to deliver on our promise to  our veterans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell me one of the biggest issues and how do you fix it and  that is restoring trust and accountability at the VA.  What is your  solution to those?</p><p>SHULKIN:  I think we all know that in the wait time crisis in April 2014,  we did let the country down.  We did let our veterans down.  And it's much  easier to lose trust and it is to gain it back.  </p><p>So we are slowly gaining that trust back and we're seeing that happen as we  really begin to deliver and transform the VA to be a system that we're all  proud of once again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why?  Why with those wait times such a problem?  How did that  happen?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think that it was really two things.  One is it was our  lack of willingness to ask for the resources that we needed to care for our  country's veterans and we just fell behind.</p><p>Secondly, it was a culture in the VA of not willing to come forward and  talk about what was really happening to hide those long wait times.</p><p>Frankly, no system is going to be able to regain trust if it isn't  transparent and if it isn't accountable.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have said in the past, look, if a veteran wants to go to a  private medical provider, then do it.  People saw that in, wait a second,  is he for privatization?  Is he going to change something?  What's your  stance on that?</p><p>SHULKIN:  I came from the private sector.  So when I entered the Veterans  Affairs, I was hoping to trying to see whether it made sense to privatize  the VA.  And I quickly learned that the VA is a unique national resource,  that we can't simply just let veterans get all their care in the private  sector, but they'd be losing a lot of very valuable services that are  important to care for men and women.</p><p>So I believe the solution is an integration of what's really great and best  about the VA as well as what's better and best about the private sector.</p><p>Our servicemen and women deserve the very best to what about both these  systems can give them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because you're from the private sector, you have an opinion on  private sector people running agencies.  What do you think about the fact  the president has surrounded himself with business people?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think what we need in government is more best practices  of businesses.  I think we need to take what's working in the private  sector and make sure that government can function that way.</p><p>And when government gets bloated, full regulations on red tape, it doesn't  serve people well.  So I think having this private sector people in the  government makes a lot of sense.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got this new Fox News poll out and it shows that voters  more faith in the military compared to other national institutions.   Ninety-six of those surveyed said that they have a great deal or some  confidence in the military.</p><p>Secretary Shulkin, last week you reportedly promised major changes.  We're  coming to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  What can our servicemen and  women expect?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, first of all, that poll makes sense to me.  When I have the  privilege of spending time with our men and women in uniform, you can't  help but feel proud.  These are courageous patriotic Americans that really  should give confidence in the country and I feel confident with them.</p><p>I think the changes that we need or to make VA accountable to essentially  be open and transparent about what's going on and to give more choice so  that people can get the very best of care wherever they need to get it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We are expecting the president tonight to propose $54 billion  increase spending on the military.  How do you feel about that?  Where do  you think the money ought to go?  Because when we talk about the military  right now, when we speak to veterans, they all tell us they need more  resources.</p><p>SHULKIN:  Yes, what I know from history and I know the president  appreciates this.  When we make a decision to send our men and women off to  protect us and to fight for our country, that's a lifetime commitment.</p><p>And so when you create the spending at the very beginning of the defense  department, you need to have that commitment all the way through for  veterans.  Because we are committed to our veterans for life.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you identify areas that you believe are absolutely needed  in terms of extra spend?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, we have projections that show what the need is going to be.   We know that our men and women coming back from almost recent conflicts or  coming back with not only physical injuries but also the invisible injuries  of war.  And sometimes, it takes additional resources to be able to make  sure that we're treating those invisible wounds.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  And that's something that I think the  president that actually has mentioned as well.</p><p>How do you convince someone who's watching you now the leader at the VA but  you're an insider and someone who says look, this is broken.  We need an  outsider to come in and fix it.  How do you convince them that no, no, no.   You know this and that's why you are the best man to lead this?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, it's not my job to convince people.  I want people to watch  our results.  We are committed to fixing this.  We know we have to do  better and we are going to do better.</p><p>I've been in government now about 18 months.  That's long enough to  understand how the system and where the problems are.  And my discussions  with the president have been that we have to make these changes quickly and  being able to know where the problems are is going to allow us to do that  as quick as we need to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, President Bush visited MacDill Air Force base in  Florida yesterday.  He signed copies of his new book honoring veterans.   Last night, the former commander-in-chief sat down for an interview with  Sean Hannity and talked about his interactions with military families.   Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm kind of a crier.  When a mom hugs  me and talks about her son, it affected me.  On the other hand, it is hard  for many people to understand.  But when you go to Walter Reed and a  soldier looks at you who's lost his legs, I'd do it again.</p><p>Or you're riding mountain bikes with these troops, some of them lost a leg  who went back into combat.  Or a mother whose son lost her life and said, I  just want you to know my son died doing what he wanted to do.  It lifts  your spirit.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Secretary.</p><p>SHULKIN: Well, I recently had a chance to visit with President Bush at his  library in Dallas.  And I have a great deal of respect.  I think that the  president like many of us after he spent time with the men and women that  serve our country, it impacts you.  And he truly feels the commitment to  these men and women.</p><p>And his book his paintings and his life commitment now to those men and  women now to those men and women is really inspiring to me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  When you look at today's military, the modern military versus  what we saw just 10 years ago, how do you make a distinction?   What's  different today and what are the new realities that required a different  take?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think the big difference is that so many people that are  injured on the battlefield now survive.  And years ago these would have  been injuries that would've killed them.  So we're seeing people come back  with absolutely devastating and complex types of injuries that now we are  responsible for making sure that we provide them with the best care.</p><p>And that complexity has really changed the VA because we need to respond to  those injuries.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How do you respond effectively?  Is it a money issue?  What is  it that you need in terms of new tools?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think it's in part a money issue, but that really isn't  the big problem.  Fortunately, this president has made the commitment to  support our veterans with the resources we need.</p><p>We also have to be changing.  We have to be looking for new and better ways  to ensure that we are managing and treating the conditions that are coming  back.  This is new territory and that's why VA, not only provides care but  does research.  Our research which is the largest dedicated to veterans is  helping us improve our care every day.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So when you hear the conversation taking place right now for  example about ObamaCare, what's your takeaway there knowing what you've  seen at the VA in terms of health care?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I think that what we know about the VA is providing a  comprehensive system of care that is providing not only physical treatment  but the psychological, social, economic treatment really is what people  need to have well-being in their life.  And I think this comprehensive  system of care has really been impactful and important for our country's  veterans.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you looking toward anything specific that you'd like to  hear from the president tonight in that regard?</p><p>SHULKIN:  Well, I speak to the president.  The president is absolutely  committed not only to a strong country and to a security, but also to  making sure that we honor our commitment.  When we asked people to serve  their country, but that is the lifetime commitment.  That the country's  prepared to follow through on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>SHULKIN:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate your time.  Secretary David Shulkin there.  Fox  Business Network is taking you live to the president's address tonight to a  joint session of congress.</p><p>It kicks off at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.  We've got analysis throughout the  program.  And \"Mornings with Maria\" will be live tomorrow morning right  here in Washington D.C. for in-depth analysis after we hear the president's  address tonight.</p><p>We'll take a short break.  We're live from Washington and we'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The vice chairman of Samsung, four other  officials being indicted.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl,  over to you.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The prosecutors in South  Korea have announced the indictment of Samsung heir and vice chairman Lee  Jae-yong and the other officials.  That happened earlier today.  He was  arrested February 17th and a move that polarized that country.  Lee's  accused of being deeply involved in a corruption scandal that led to the  impeachment of South Korea's president.  He is now charged with bribery,  embezzlement, perjury, hiding assets abroad and concealing profit gained  from criminal acts.</p><p>Another headlines this morning, YouTube users around the world are now  watching more than one billion hours of video a day.  Experts say the  number keeps going up as Google's artificial intelligence continues to  produce as recommended videos to users.</p><p>And YouTube is now threatening traditional television.  Nielsen data shows  Americans watch an average of 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV  shows a day.  Numbers are getting very close.</p><p>And finally this, Maria, I dare you to find a cuter picture than this one.   A feel in a Japanese who was given a plush toy seal by zoo staff.  He  simply just fell in love with the toy.  He hugs the toy.  He puts the toy  on his back for a ride.  These pictures have obviously gone viral.  The  internet is in love as well.  And this probably going to all end up on a  lot of phones.</p><p>And you know what Maria, those are the big stories from New York City.  I  give you the seal.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That is so cute, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  </p><p>Coming up, a presidential walk down memory lane.  How President Trump's  tonight to a joint session of congress will compare to his predecessors  over the years.  That's next, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump making his first address to  congress tonight and history shows the speech could have a lasting impact.</p><p>Joining us right now is presidential historian, author of a New Book, \"Game  of Thorns,\" Doug Wead is with us.  And, Doug, it's good to have you on the  program.</p><p>DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>How do you think the president speech will compare to those before him?</p><p>WEAD:  I think he's going to be very different.  I think he will be on  message.  So he's going to talk about the economy and make America great  and he's probably going to go what his critics will say, and his close  friends will say some as off message.</p><p>He'll probably say some a little bizarre thing.  But I've learned in  researching \"Game of Thorns,\" when he's off message, he's on message.   There's two message.  One is restore America, make it great again.  And the  second message is I no politician.  So when he deviates, he's still on  message.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then he always adlibs.  Sometimes it gets him in trouble.   But he does always adlibs.  So one of the most emotional addresses over the  years was from Lyndon Johnson.  Sworn in just days after the assassination  of John F. Kennedy.  Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LYNDON JOHNSON 36TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  All I have that I would have given  gladly not to be standing here today.  No words are sad enough to express  our sense of loss.  No words are strong enough to express our  determination, to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, this was an emotional moment in time.  But explain  the emotional impact that this had on the country.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes, this was a very tough time for the country, a hurtful time for  the country.  And for Lyndon Johnson personally.  This was a devastating  moment.  He was a great man.  He was a powerful man, that dominating force  in Washington but he was now destined forever to live in the shadow of John  F. Kennedy.  This young upstart who took power.  </p><p>So personally, this was a frustrating moment for Lyndon Johnson.  But he  knew the role he was destined to play by history and he had to play it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look, we're expecting to hear a lot about the economy tonight,  tax reform, rollback of regulation.  That was something President Reagan  brought up during his address.  Let's take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RONALD RAEGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  Almost eight million Americans are out  of work.  These are people who want to be productive.  The threat of  layoffs and unemployment hangover other millions and all who work are  frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.  We must begin  now.  But people are watching and waiting.  They don't demand miracles.   They do expect us to act.  Let us act together.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Act together.  Your thoughts.</p><p>WEAD:  Yes.  Reagan gave one of the few joint speeches to the joint  sessions where he actually did what he said he was going to do and I expect  Donald Trump to be that kind of president.  Most of these speeches when you  study them, they'll give the speech and they do the exact opposite.  It's  uncanny.</p><p>But in this case, I think Trump like Reagan is going to do what he's  telegraphing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can he balance, guys, this presidential demeanor, but also be  Donald Trump?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I wanted to call out if any of the  democrats have called him or boo him.  I wanted to point to them and call  them out by name and say, who are you booing?  And then call them all their  nonsense, I would actually love to see that.  It's not presidential, but it  could be Trumpian.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And I'd like to see him say, OK, congressmen, such and such,  you're with illegal immigrant that's done terrific things in this country.   That's exactly the kind of immigrants we want.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I'm looking at is other undertones of Andrew  Jackson.  This is what we got in the inaugural.  Steve Bannon gave -- it  was very involved in this speech.  It had a lot of America first  nationalist undertones that hearken back to Andrew Jackson.</p><p>Do you think we're going to see that in this feature?  Or are we going to  see a different kind of president?</p><p>WEAD:  Well, we're seeing it in his handling of the media because Andrew  Jackson was devastated by what the media did to his wife that killed his  wife and he hated the media, organized his own network of newspapers to  oppose them.</p><p>In \"Game of Thorns,\" I get into the media problems that Donald Trump has  and it's staggering.  The left and the right are opposed to this guy.  Much  of it has to do about China.  And I have to say this.  My name is on the  book, but the people who really gave the information to me from the book or  sources who risk their jobs, they were with Hillary Clinton for 10, 15, 20  years.  And there's some people in China who risk their lives to give this  information about the Chinese flow of money to the Clintons.  So it's a  serious issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It is a serious issue.  And the book is \"Game of Thorns.\"  And  we expect it's going to be a big seller.  Thank you so much Doug Wead.   We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

The Wall  Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  And We'll be  joined by Rachel Campos-Duffy shortly.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  Great setting.  Once again, back in  Washington as we preview the president's plans tonight.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.  Big increases in defense  spending, big increases in infrastructure spending, and it sounds like he's  directing his agencies to cutback spending in places like the EPA and the  state department.  All the money that's been going overseas, he wants to  keep it at home, America first, that's his message.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But also, what does he say about the repeal and replace of  ObamaCare because, again, he conceded yesterday that the health law is  unbelievably complex according to President Trump and then also tax reform.  </p><p>I've got a little -- there's a line at the bottom of an article in the New  York Times today that might give investors pause.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  On the tax reform package.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  On the tax reform package.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We got a lot to talk about on that, that is a big story, you're  so right.  We're going to continue that this morning.</p><p>And joining us this morning and joining the conversation, Veterans Affair  Secretary, David Shulkin, this is his second secretary from the president's  cabinet to speak out.  We, of course, heard from the Treasury Secretary  yesterday, Steen Mnuchin.  And this morning, we hear from VA Secretary,  David Shulkin right here with us.  Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us.  And Tennessee  Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn will join us.  Plus, Ohio Congressman, Tim  Ryan is going to walk through the democrat's plan.  And Former Chief of  Staff under Bush 43 and Business Rountable President and CEO, Josh Bolton,  that's a new role for Josh Bolten, I'm going to talk with him about it.</p><p>Big show ahead, so stay right there and do stay with us as we kick it off  right now with our story.  President Trump is set to outline his agenda on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  At the  address, with joint session of congress tonight.  (inaudible) with details  right now, all the specifics at the White House.  Peter, good morning to  you.</p><p>PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Maria.  That's right,  we're getting more details on the president's speech tonight from some of  his top aides.</p><p>And as you mentioned, he will discuss a number of initiatives including  healthcare reform, infrastructure, border security and other issues.  He'll  also review the accomplishments of his first month, in particular those  executive orders and his Supreme Court nominee.  The president sat down  with Fox &amp; Friends to give us a preview of his remarks, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from the heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming out.  We have to  understand, ObamaCare has been a disaster, it's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border.</p><p>And remember this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting  the bad ones out, the bad people, gang members, drug lords, in some cases,  murders.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARNES:  Now we expect tonight that his most concrete largest initiative  will be his announcement, his call for another $54 billion in defense  spending, he will ask congress for that, a 10 percent increase his aide  say.</p><p>An administration official said however that the broad theme of the speech  will be the renewal of America and the optimistic vision for all Americans,  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  And, of course, we're all  focused on where the spending is going to be.  Peter Barnes, thank you at  the White House this morning.  Rachel Campos-Duffy with us this morning,  and Rachel, a Senior White House Official describing President Trump's  speech tonight as a renewal of the American spirit.</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's a great way to  describe it, everything.</p><p>This guy's going to have an audience like nobody's business tonight.  I  mean he's a showman, the inauguration was a big speech but that was at  12:00 in the afternoon, this is primetime, people want to see what he's  going to say and the democrats are making a little bit interesting with  their bringing in guests or they're going to mix it up.</p><p>I hear Meryl Streep might come, I heard she was invited, they're bringing  dreamers and all kinds of people to mix it up and I think he's got a real  opportunity to give an optimistic message and a brand new start.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's funny that they say Meryl Streep is going to attend  because the word was Rosie O'Donnell was going to be protesting outside  actually.  So that will be exciting.</p><p>But in terms of the audience, Dagen, what's your take on this because a lot  of the democrats are saying, \"Look, we want to bring someone who came here  as an immigrant, is now an American citizen but has contributed to our  country in a good way\" as a message to the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And what message are they trying to send?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Because, again --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're so right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- we make the distinction between illegal immigrants that he  addresses that so many people in this country think that illegal  immigration is a problem, we're not talking about legal immigrants who have  come to this country whether it is through visas and through -- and have  gotten green cards, that's not the message.</p><p>And by the way, in his move to stop illegal immigration, he said we're not  going to touch dreamers or children who are here under the deferred action  on children under President Obama, that's number one.  And at least the  democrats are showing up which remember the dozens who do not show up to  the inauguration at least will be there.  I dare them to boo, I dare them  to boo.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  That will happen.  That will happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Shame on them.</p><p>HILSENRANTH:  When you talk about democrats, one of the important things we  have to think about is the president announces his plans for spending.   He's going to need some democratic support, he needs 60 votes to pass his  appropriations measures.</p><p>So he's got to find some ways to reach out at the -- if he wants to  increase military spending, wants to increase infrastructure spending and  cutback all these agencies, he's got to get some democrats on board.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out, he needs the democrats for the  replacement in ObamaCare in the senate as well.  If the repeal is easy  under the -- you can just -- you get a simple majority on the  reconciliation but it's the replacement and that becomes a huge hurdle in  the next year.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And by the way, that is why they did ObamaCare first because  they didn't want to have to deal with needing the extra votes for tax  reform.  They do that during the budget reconciliation and they feel that  it's an easier path to get that done, that's why ObamaCare's first.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You want to know the line that investors should pay attention  to?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's in the New York Times, it is the last paragraph with an  article about the healthcare law and it mentions that as Steve Mnuchin the  Treasury Secretary told you that they want tax reform, tax cuts for both  businesses and middle class Americans by in time with the August recess.</p><p>The last line says, \"Since healthcare must be addressed first, tax  legislation could easily be pushed into 2018 according to members of  congress and administration officials.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's critical.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Even Mnuchin has said that August is ambitious.  So when he  sat down with us he acknowledge that it might go a little bit later.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But they still have October -- they still have the fall to  finish some of this stuff, I think that's (inaudible).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I think the expectation based on this market run up, some of it  is just fundamental but the expectation is to gets done in this year and  not 2018.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you tried to take those expectations down little by  little?  There's a real nuance in terms of the way they're speaking all the  officials about this?</p><p>But look, Steven Mnuchin said very clearly that the real impact is going to  be in 2018 and I think that -- and you know really took our expectations  down first.  When we were hearing in Washington, remember Ted Cruz?   Remember Ted Cruz was the first person to say and we felt, \"Wait a minute,  we thought we were going to get tax reform right away\" but ever since then  they've been taking these expectations down.</p><p>So let's talk about the budget for a second because we're looking for a $20  billion boost in military spending, the president has also hinted at more  infrastructure spending during a meeting with governors, he said this  yesterday at the White House, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP:  We're going to make it easier for the states to invest in  infrastructure and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on  infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East and we have  potholes all over our highways and our roads.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  On that note, infrastructure stocks fight on Wall Street after  the commander-in-chief's announcement, let's take a look.  This is one of  the areas Jon Hilsenrath that has been leading this rally, the  infrastructure, construction aides.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  And this is an area where he might actually be able to  get some democratic buy-in because you want people on both sides, in fact,  the Obama Administration wanted the infrastructure spending too.</p><p>So -- and I think the other reason we saw infrastructure stocks reacting  yesterday is we haven't heard a lot about that, there's been a lot of talk  about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, a lot of talk about military  spending and tax cuts, we haven't heard so much about the infrastructure  piece of this and how they're going to fund it.  So the fact that he's  brining that back up again makes you think, \"All right, maybe it is on the  agenda.\"</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And on the military spending side, his proposed increase in  defense spending $54 billion, 10 percent increase, it's only $18.5 billion  above levels proposed by President Obama and it's short of what the likes  of Senator John McCain want.  </p><p>The Trump Administration is talking about a little over $600 billion,  McCain wants $640 billion.  So it's even -- so when you talk about  additional spending, they could go further.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I mean, the big question for me is how do you pay for this  stuff?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's easy to convince people to spend more money up here on  Capitol Hill but how is he going to be able to get the cuts in all these  other programs to -- that pays for it?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And no -- questioning no changes to Medicare and Social  Security.  Those are the big kind of tsunamis waiting for the Americans.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The obvious answer is bigger deficits.  But as he has said so  many times including this campaign, $20 trillion debt, how do you do all  this with $20 trillion?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're going to put the debt over the long-term and they're  going to look at it over the long-term and not look at that as a near-term  priority, obviously.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  They're going to allow --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They've got a lot of plans, they have to do that.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  And I think they're going to think they can grow out  of this as well.  I mean you're seeing the (inaudible) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You can't grow out of Medicare and Social Security.  You can't  grow out of the entitlement.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  No, not of Social Security, not over the entitlement but as  far as paying and also we've seen him take airplanes that costs billions of  dollars and not millions of dollars off the price.</p><p>So people are expecting him to do that and look, he's a builder.  People  want him to build and unlike the stimulus where -- I don't know what came  out of that, I can't find a road that was built from that and all the  (inaudible) jobs, this somebody who said he's going to build people's trust  that he once built, he wants to do this, he's let congress know this was a  huge priority for him and people trust him with this part of building, they  like him.  So they think he's the one to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep navigating what we're expecting tonight.   And Fox Business Network is taking you live to the president's address  tonight as he addresses a joint session of congress tonight at 9:00pm  Eastern.</p><p>Mornings with Maria will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. for  in-depth analysis as well.  We are previewing it this morning and we will  have the full announcements tomorrow with all the names you want weighing  in.  </p><p>We'll take a short break, when we come back, tragedy in California, a plane  has crashed into a home killing four people, injuring two others, the  latest on the survivor's conditions, that's coming next.</p><p>And then Takata pleading guilty, the details as the Japanese auto parts  maker agrees to pay $1 billion fine in their airbag scandal, so many  automakers getting caught up in that, we'll be right back with that.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane has crashed in Southern  California, it left four people dead.  Cheryl Casone is in New York with  the details now, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria from our studio  here in New York.  Well that plane crashed into two homes killing at least  four and injuring two others.  Cell phone video caught the moment of the  crash, you can see huge flames and thick smoke following an explosion.   Witnesses described a chaotic scene.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the back house of the neighbors are exiting, an elderly man exiting,  firefighters were taking people to safety.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on the plane, they  were flying back home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  Fire official say one of the teenagers was thrown from a  backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl had only minor injuries.  The  pilot also survived this crash we should say.</p><p>Well in other news, Japanese auto parts maker, Takata is now pleading  guilty of fraud and agreeing to pay a billion dollars for concealing a  defect in millions of its airbags.  The defect has been blamed for at least  11 deaths in the U.S. alone and more than a 180 injuries worldwide.  And,  of course, the biggest recall in American auto history involving 42 million  cars and as to 69 million airbags.</p><p>Well, as investors await President Trump's address to congress tonight,  they're going to be watching earnings from Target before the bell this  morning.  The retail chain expected to post earnings of a $1.51 share on  sales of $20.74 billion and, of course. we'll get to look at the holiday  season for that company.  Other companies reporting this morning, AutoZone,  Domino's Pizza, and Etsy.  </p><p>And finally this Maria, Snap, the parent of Snapchat gearing up for that  huge $3.2 billion IPO that's going to be Thursday, on the New York Stock  Exchange.  Ahead of the big debut, the company says it expects investors  who buy as much as a quarter of the shares to agree not to sell them for a  year.  This could be a single demand, it's pretty high for this offering  Maria.  Snap targeting evaluation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion  and, again, that stock is going to be listed on the New York Stock  Exchange, the ticker will be snap.</p><p>And those are your headlines from New York, Maria back to you at  Washington.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thanks so much.  Let's take a short break,  when we come back, President Trump pointing fingers what he claims Obama is  behind the recent protests at town hall meetings.  </p><p>The Warren Buffett takes a big bite out of Apple, they're Berkshire  Hathaway more than doubling its stake in the technology giant, we got all  those details certainly has been a money maker for Warren Buffett this last  few months, back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well into the battle of the presidents now,  President Trump is blaming President Obama for the country's lack of unity,  watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it.  I also think it's politics, that's  the way it is.  And look, I have a very different understanding --  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Bush wasn't going after Clinton, Clinton was going  after Bush.</p><p>TRUMP:  Well you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes.   You know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  I  think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly  behind it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us here on set.   Mark, what do you make of this?</p><p>MARK PENN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR HILLARY CLINTON:  Well I think it's so  unfortunate because I think today really Trump have to reach out to the  other side.  I mean I think that's the critical opportunity he's got with  his speech today, why throw Obama, at Obama, why divided up this early in  the morning.  Big mistake in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well look, I definitely agree that there's no room for sort of  pointing fingers when we have all the big issues at hand that the president  and everyone else is trying to do but I want to be clear, in President  Obama's last speech to the country, he did say organized a few times.</p><p>If you don't like what's going on, get up and make some noise.  I mean he  did say things like that in that last speech, didn't he?</p><p>PENN:  Yes.  But look, the president's got to get democrats and republicans  applauding tonight.  If this gets so rough during the day and Obama comes  out, democrats will start boycotting, he'll get the opposite of what he was  looking for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you've done this so many times, you have supervised six  speeches, presidential speeches.  When you say he's got to get everybody  applauding, talk about that.  How important is that and why is that so  important to get the whole room buying in right away?</p><p>PENN:  Look, the reaction of the room and the willingness of everyone to  applaud him at anything, right, is gold for him.</p><p>I remember in 1998, we didn't know whether or not the country is going to  impeach President Clinton until they stood up and applauded.  He has a  similar moment, right?  The democrats have never applauded him, he's got to  start out I think with something like the military and honoring the  military so that he gets everybody applauding and in that mode because  remember, he'll talk about infrastructure and some people will applaud,  he'll talk about taxes, he'll talk about immigration and a lot will sit on  their hands.  He needs a key moment of unity to make the speech successful  because that's what people are looking for at home.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think he's looking at it that way though?  I mean he's  so unconventional, his inaugural speech was not what most people expected,  very America first.  I mean he could come at this from a completely  different angle, didn't he?</p><p>PENN:  He could.  And I think if it gets raucous, remember, I conducted a  Harvard-Harris Poll last week, 73 percent want democrats to work with  republicans and 68 percent want Trump to work with the democrats.  So he  doesn't show that tonight then his ratings are going to start to really go  down here because they want that done.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But could it be also that if the democrats behave so badly  that it ends up just making them look bad and so maybe he doesn't feel like  he has to try to win them over rather than talk about the military you  said.  </p><p>And the more they misbehave, the more of them that gave their tickets to  code pink to interrupt and really sort of hashtag resist that it's going to  make the dems look back.</p><p>PENN:  Well, what we've seen for the first time is the republicans have a  slightly higher image in the Wall Street Journal poll than democrats.  So I  don't think the resistance strategy has been working.  So I think tonight,  the democrats will do better if they can show some unity around some key  issues and resistance around others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, I think you make a great point and this weekend on  Sunday Morning Futures, I interviewed Congressman Langevin who is bringing  with him tonight a Pakistani born doctor who is here in America, he's a  Muslim-American by the way.</p><p>He's legally here, he's done great things for this country in terms of his  work but I kept pushing back at him saying, look, there's a different  between legal and illegal, why are you grandstanding?  Why bring the guest  anyway?  Why not just go to the speech, sleeves rolled up, ready to work  and get the people's business done?  And so that's the issue, why the  grandstanding?  Just let's get to work.</p><p>PENN:  Well the balcony traditionally has been used in these speeches.   Usually the president's balcony is the most important thing that he can add  to his speech.  The democrats are doing it in reverse, they're saying,  \"Hey, what about the guys whose he's excluding?  What about the people here  who may be here illegally but are operating legally and following our laws?   What's going to them?\"  </p><p>And I think it's fair that they raise that issue but remember, look, the  business community wants to hear about infrastructure and tax cuts, they've  been waiting, if they don't hear that, there's going to be some I think  serious negative consequences.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There have been a slew of holes out over the last few days  including the Wall Street Journal's polls which showed that the public is  for the president's policies, they have some questions about the way he's  behaving, what jumped out at you from these polls?  What did you learn  about his first couple of months in office and how the public is receiving  it?</p><p>PENN:  Well he doesn't have honeymoon ratings, on the other hand, his  ratings are no lower than Obama's or Clinton's or Bush's were during most  of the presidency.  He's in the high 40s I think in most of the polls.  </p><p>My poll came out at 48 percent job approval, he hasn't reached over to the  rest of the country but he's got a strong base, people support a good  measure of his policies, they think he will bring change in the Wall Street  Journal poll.  So he's got a lot of things working for him but the division  that he's creating, comments like the Obama thing really are creating this  division that is holding him back from being president of everybody.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But do you really think that there isn't a group of Obama  loyalists that may very well be behind the protesters?</p><p>PENN:  I think the protesters is genuine because --  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Can you say that's not real really?</p><p>PENN:  Because remember, Trump is in fact following the strategy of  dividing the country in his speeches.  Dividing the country with comments  like that.  So -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well President Obama did that (inaudible) he's pointing a lot  it's the republican's fault on every turn.  Come on.</p><p>PENN:  Look, for every action there's a reaction in politics.  So I think  the protests are real, I think the sentiment he stirred up are real.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And he's the first act community organizer president and  it's very clear that they are -- I just went to a town hall with my husband  yesterday and it was very well -- they have a pamphlet, they have a  strategy, they organized ahead of time, they eat an hour before the town  hall starts.</p><p>I mean, there's an organization behind it and that's fine, people should  come and talk to their congressmen but it's really unseemly I think to have  an ex-president really putting his weight behind that in that way.  I think  it's divisive.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We don't know exactly what the president is doing obviously,  President Obama.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's only a mile from the Capitol.  He's living just right  here for a reason.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  This group organizing for action, we don't know how involved  the president is in direct to the activities.  But this group that was  associated with the Obama's campaign organizing for action, the word is  that they're involved in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And we know that Soros is involved hugely in this step.  Before  we --  </p><p>PENN:  That there's real sentiment behind these protests.  You can't  organize people who don't care about things.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Before we go, I want to get your take on Tom Perez as the  Democratic National Committee chair.  What's your take?  </p><p>PENN:  Well, look, I -- I think -- I think that it's great that -- that he  won.  I think that Democrats and a -- a lot of Jewish supporters and donors  would have real problems had he not won.  </p><p>And I think it reaffirms.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, he put Keith Ellison as his deputy, though.  </p><p>PENN:  Well, but, you know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, that's -- that's the guy that a lot of moderates didn't  want.  </p><p>PENN:  But that at least shows, look, we've got to bring the party  together.  I think they came out of that pretty well because the scare was  that -- that, in fact, the party would take such a turn to the left.  </p><p>And the answer was it didn't.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, why do you -- why do you say Jewish donors would have.</p><p>PENN:  Well, I think -- I think -- I think there was a lot of concern about  Ellison.  Haim Saban (ph), for example, said he would not, you know, if I  remember it correctly, would -- would no longer support Democrats.  I (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because of his comments about Israel.  </p><p>PENN:  .well, because that's right.  And -- and so I think that would  really have stirred it up.  But -- but I do think they brought the party  together.  </p><p>They had to do that.  I think -- I think the Democrats are in better shape.   The question is, when are they going to get a strategy -- a legislative  strategy here that makes sense in response to -- to Trump.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and in response to what the people want.  Let's face it.   It's -- it's really economic issues that the people are hoping that the  Democrats focus on.  </p><p>Mark, great insights from you as always.  </p><p>PENN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Penn joining us there.  we're going to  take a short break.  </p><p>When we come back, President Trump speaking to a joint session of Congress  tonight.  He's expecting to call for a substantial increase in military  spending -- what it means for your security.  </p><p>And then new drinks sprouting out (ph) at Starbucks -- the beverages coming  to the menu just in time for spring.  We'll be back in two minutes' time,  back in a moment (ph).  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks for  being with us.  </p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  We are coming here from Washington.  It is Tuesday,  February 28.  Your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p>President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time as commander-in-chief.  The president is expected to stress  unity during the speech.  </p><p>However, before taking the stage, the president blamed his predecessor for  tensions in the country.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are  certainly behind it.  And some of the leaks possibly come from that group,  you know, some of the leaks which are really very serious leaks because  they're very bad in terms of national security.  </p><p>But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him being behind  things, that's politics.  </p><p>And it will probably continue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network will bring you live coverage of the  president's address tonight.  That's at 9 p.m. Eastern.  </p><p>So stay with us on the Fox Business Network as we will have full analysis  and live coverage of that presidential address.  It could be another record  day in Wall Street.  </p><p>Futures are indicating the markets are flat right now.  But the lifting --  the Dow Industrial is up about 13 points.  </p><p>The Dow coming off of a record, 12th consecutive record high yesterday,  tying the record set 30 years ago.  Now, a gain today would be a 13th  record close in a row.  </p><p>That's never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.  And as you can see,  the markets are looking really fractionally moving. </p><p>But the Dow is, in fact, trading in all-time record territory.  Take a look  at European markets.  Stocks are searching for direction there with  fractional gain.  </p><p>And the DAX index is actually lower.  The others are fractionally higher.   Target revenue misses expectations.  </p><p>As you see there, we're watching earnings this morning.  And Target is  missing estimates on both earnings and revenue -- the numbers on the bottom  of your screen.  </p><p>We're going to take a look at the stock in a moment.  In Asia overnight,  meanwhile, markets were mixed.  </p><p>Take a look.  Shanghai and the Nikkei as well as the Kospi up, the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong down.  Well, at least 15 people injured in another crash  at Brazil's carnival celebration.  The details after a float collapses.  </p><p>Plus Warren Buffett taking a big bite out of Apple -- why the billionaire  investor is betting big on the technology giant.  And Starbucks is adding  to its menu -- how you can soon get your hands on the new iced drinks just  in time for spring, plus details on the company's new upscale roastery.  </p><p>Plus, Antonio Brown cashes in in the Steel City.  We are breaking down the  wide receiver's massive new contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </p><p>We want to hear about that.  First, our top story, though, this half hour.   Bolstering the nation's military -- that's a top priority for President  Trump.  </p><p>The White House says that the president's first budget proposal will  include a $54 billion increase in defense spending.  Military stocks like  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon rallied on the news.  </p><p>The move will likely garner plenty of public support.  The latest fox news  poll shows that 45 percent of Americans believe the country is spending too  little on military.  </p><p>Dagen is talking about this and looking at these proposals this morning.   What are your thoughts on this budget, Dagen? </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that it's a balancing act for  President Trump that he is -- he promised to increase spending on defense.   There's a 10 percent increase there, a little more than $400 billion, but  not at the levels (ph) that, say, a Senator John McCain has been calling  for. </p><p>And we should also point out that his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has - - That (ph) Senator McCain did not like him, doesn't really like him,  because he has been a deficit hawk.  And so, I think that you're getting --  you're getting something for people who want greater military spending,  greater defense spending, but also people who worry about a $20 trillion  debt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, when you -- when you take a look.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  There's -- there's always the (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  .when you speak to military people, Jon, they always say that  we've got the oldest fleet in the Navy in -- in decades.  We're got the  oldest, you know, armament in the Army in decades.  I mean.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .we need upgrade, particularly as it relates to -- to  technology.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And as Dagen just pointed out, there's always  been this tension in the Republican Party, between the deficit hawks and  the military hawks.  And we see it between Mulvaney -- Mulvaney and McCain.  </p><p>And I think that's something that the president is going to have to wrestle  with over the next few months as he tries to take the ideas that he's going  to be talking about tonight and turn them into -- into actual policy.  </p><p>There is tension inside the Republican Party and within his plans between  controlling all of the debt, controlling the deficit and achieving all of  these goals if he wants to set out tax reform, military spending,  infrastructure spending, and most importantly, as -- as you said earlier,  there's going to be no -- no talk tonight about doing anything on Social  Security and Medicare.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  No.  They were very clear about that.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  How do you make all of this fit together? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Which is -- which, to somebody worried about the debt and the  looming tsunami of -- so Medicare is going to go broke.  The hospital trust  fund goes broke 11 years from now.  </p><p>And we'll only be able to pay out 87 cents on the dollar in benefits.   Sixty-nine percent of our budget is mandatory spending on entitlements and  interest on the debt.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  So more than two-thirds, they have no control over.  So when you  start talking about cutting the EPA, you're really just chipping away.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, agree (ph), I mean, that's the important point.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And that's small potatoes, right?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  What he's going to be talking about tonight is cutting back on  the discretionary programs, a lot coming out of the State Department,  foreign aide, foreign diplomacy, America First.  But you -- you can't solve  these problems in the long run just by -- by cutting back discretionary.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, when was the last time you heard a politician come out  and say, I promised you this and now, I'm taking it back?  I mean, the --  for those people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare and  Medicaid, they don't want those programs touched.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they were promised.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, the idea -- idea is you don't do it for.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they ever paid in.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .the idea is you don't it to -- you don't do it to people who  are getting it now.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But you tell people who are in their 30s.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .and 40s, you -- you might have to expect to work a little bit  longer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and most people understand that, right?  I mean, they  get that they -- that these programs are going broke.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They -- they like to know.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So at some point.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .more (ph) because they think they're going to get nothing  as -- if the system goes bankrupt the way it is right now.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  But they -- but.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The younger people are not expecting.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They're not expecting.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Younger people are not expecting.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  We talked to Jon two minutes (ph) ago, I'm not going to get  any (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  They -- that's what I'm saying.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, it's -- it's still a third rail because that no one in  this town can get it -- can get anything done on it.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And the president himself doesn't, you know, he said he  campaigned.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Even the most conservative people, when they close to retirement  age, they're like I'm getting mine.  I'm taking mine.  I have arguments  with my parents about this all the time.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Right.  I paid in (ph).  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And I -- I tell them -- they're saying (ph) -- well, I paid, and  I said but you're taking more than you paid in.  That's why it's going  broke.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And Mark Zuckerberg doesn't need it.  I mean, you know what  I'm saying?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  There's -- there's some ways that we can cut back on certain  incomes that people don't actually need (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you know, I mean, a guy like -- a business guy like -- like  a Ken Lagone has been on this program and said, I don't want this Social  Security check that I get.  I don't need it. </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Don't send it to him.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I'm just saying there are certain -- there are certain  pockets of the population that understand that this is not happening over  the long term.  And they're not expecting it.  </p><p>And yet, the leadership is afraid.  They're afraid to make that move  because that will be the political ad (ph), they took your Social Security.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  It's well (ph).</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's the granny off the cliff ad.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's exactly.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And we roll (ph) that.  I'm just kidding.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But it's also real.  I was at a town hall yesterday where a  woman was in tears saying, I depend on this.  So please tell me you're not  going to cut this (ph).  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But this is.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  So it is very real.  </p><p>Jon:  But they have a very hard time getting across the message that we're  not going to take away from you but we want to give people 10, 20, 30 years  to prepare to work a few extra months in their life.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It means you have to educate the public.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  And then but anytime they try to raise that idea, it  immediately gets translated into you're taking Social Security checks away  from older people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, last night, former President George W. Bush sat  down for interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.  The former president  said he was frustrated when U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq.  </p><p>But he still believes ISIS can be defeated.  Listen.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Yes, it frustrated me.  And it -- I  think what people have got to realize is this bunch of thugs can be  defeated because we did so with the surge.  And we can win again.  </p><p>And so you've heard both presidents after my time say we're going to  degrade and defeat ISIS.  And I say, go get them because they can be  degraded and defeated.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because when you look back at some  of the -- the -- some of the conversation that President Bush has had as it  relates to this topic in the past, he's been very clear.  He said, if we  pull out of Iraq, this will create another problem.  </p><p>This will motivate and empower another group.  And we don't know what their  names are right now.  </p><p>This was years ago, he said this.  And now we know what happened.  ISIS was  created.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  We  -- we (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dagen? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that it was reassuring to see  General Mattis go to Iraq.  He knows that.  </p><p>The civil war that if we pull out of Iraq at this point -- we -- we have to  discuss actually adding troops.  We have several thousand troops still in  Iraq.  </p><p>We have to discuss that.  That's why General Mattis was so reassuring to  see him pay that visit very early on in the Trump administration.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, Jon?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well -- and we're -- we're seeing the Iraqis now make some  progress and in Mosul, though it's a tough battle.  We had a story in the  paper the other day about how ISIS is using drones against Iraqi forces.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right, I saw that.  That was inside (ph).  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  If he says we're going to defeat ISIS in his speech tonight,  he's going to get a sounding -- a standing ovation.  People want him to do  this.  </p><p>And hearing George Bush.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .say yes, we -- we've done it before -- we can do this, we  can defeat these barbarians, people want to hear that.  He'll get  bipartisan support on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And -- and Mark Penn just said, he needs to get the room on  their feet.  </p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  .and in unity.  We'll see about that.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, tweeting may be to blame for Oscar's biggest  mistake in history.  </p><p>We'll tell you what happened behind the scenes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's true.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was Twitter.  And then failure to launch, fearsome (ph)  delays in Tesla's Model 3 release causing stocks to turn downward -- the  impact next, back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We're coming to you live from our country's capital with the  gorgeous sunrise behind us as you see there.  </p><p>We are enjoying this beautiful moment here in Washington as we preview the  president's speech tonight.  Markets are looking flat.  </p><p>But we're watching a couple of names on the move.  Target shares -- the one  to watch this morning.  That stock is plummeting in the premarket.  </p><p>The retailer missed earnings expectations.  They missed it on both revenue  and earnings this morning with their quarterly report.  </p><p>Earnings in the fourth quarter -- a dollar $0.45 a -- lower than the -- a  dollar $0.45 a share.  That was lower than the estimate which called for a  dollar $0.51 a share.  </p><p>Target shares look like this this morning, down better than 12 percent.  It  is down about 12 percent on Target.  </p><p>Tesla also a name to watch.  The stock is down following a downgrade from  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman is lowering its price target on the stock from  $1.90 to $1.85.  </p><p>And they issued a sell (ph) rating on Tesla.  That rating is centered on  concerns over the company's upcoming Model 3 sedan.  </p><p>We're watching Priceline this morning.  The company's fourth quarter  earnings topped expectations.  Priceline reported earnings of $14.21 a  share, versus the $13.01 that was expected.  </p><p>The stock is up better than 11 percent this year alone.  Meanwhile, another  accident with a float marring the carnival celebration in Rio de Janeiro.   Cheryl Casone with the details now.  </p><p>Cheryl?  </p><p>CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So it's the second float accident in Rio this week.   This time, the top of a he float collapsed with dancers on board.  </p><p>And 11 people were injured, two of those victims said to be in serious  condition, one with head trauma.  The parade had to be stopped for almost  25 minutes so the injured could get medical attention.  </p><p>The show was allowed to go on.  Now, police are investigating the cause of  that accident.  On Sunday, you may remember, 20 people were hurt when a  float crashed into a fence.  </p><p>Well, Warren Buffett has taken a bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway's stake at Apple now more than double what it was at the  start of the year.  </p><p>Berkshire now owns about 133 million shares of Apple.  At the end of last  year, that figure was 57 million.  </p><p>After the recent Apple buying spree, Berkshire Hathaway's stake now sits at  about $18 billion.  Well, Starbucks introducing two new drinks just in time  for spring.  </p><p>The Cinnamon Almond Macchiato and the Coconut Macchiato hits stores today  for at least a limited time.  Starbucks is also making another addition --  it's not to the menu, though.  </p><p>They are going to open one of the roasteries in Milan, Italy in late 2018,  marking their first store in Italy.  Starbucks plans to open nearly 30  roasteries worldwide, we should say.  </p><p>And it turns out the ratings were also a big blunder Sunday night.  The  Oscar's ratings tanked the lowest in nine years -- just 32.9 million  viewers turned in.  </p><p>That is more than a million less than last year.  And now, we're learning  more about the best picture disaster -- an Oscar first.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JORDAN HOROWITZ, \"LA LA LAND\" PRODUCER:  There's -- there's a mistake.   \"Moonlight,\" you guys won best picture.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  \"Moonlight\" won.  This is not a joke.  </p><p>HOROWITZ:  This is not a joke.  I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not a joke.  \"Moonlight\" has won best picture.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>CASONE:  So what's the Pricewaterhouse Coopers, who caused the disaster,  distracted just minutes before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong  envelope, he tweeted this photo of best actress winner, Emma Stone,  backstage.  Now, the mix-up happened just three minutes later when he  handed Beatty the wrong envelope.  </p><p>Cullinan's tweets reportedly not sanctioned by the academy.  He deleted the  tweet later and all other posts that he had made during the show, Maria.  </p><p>So the story continues.  And that's it.  Back to you out in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So he was tweeting and maybe got distracted and gave the wrong  envelope.  Oops.  Yes, big oops.  </p><p>All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, it's a done deal.   Antonio Brown, now the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL -- details on  his massive new contract next, back in a moment, live from Washington on a  beautiful Tuesday morning.       </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Pittsburgh Steelers making Antonio Brown the  NFL's highest-paid wide receiver yesterday, Jared max with the details now. </p><p>Jared, good morning to you.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Antonio Brown  has caught more passes in the last four years than any receiver in NFL  history during the same time span.  </p><p>To the Pittsburgh Steelers, that's what Brown can do for you.  Now, we see  what you did for him.  </p><p>The Steelers yesterday announced that Antonio Brown, who caught 12  touchdowns and totaled 1,300 yards last season, has signed a new contract  to keep him in a Steelers uniform through 2021.  It includes a $19 million  signing bonus and Brown's four-year extension calls for $68 million,  average salary $17 million a year, $2 million more than Cincinnati's A.J.  Green.  </p><p>Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Tim Tebow, got into the batter's  box for the first time yesterday at New York Mets spring training at Port  St. Lucie, Florida.  Now, 29 years old and trying to make another career in  professional baseball, Tebow showed off his strength.  </p><p>Florida Gators legend smashed nine home runs in batting practice yesterday,  impressed some baseball scouts.  Adidas, all day I dream about sand --  check this out, Adidas says it's giving away an island to any pro-football  prospect at the NFL Combine who can break the record for the fastest 40- yard dash at the Combine, which is 4.7 seconds set by Chris Johnson nine  years ago.  </p><p>But the player would have to be wearing these Adidas -- Adizero 5-Star 40  Cleats and agree to wear them for the entire upcoming season.  Now, should  a player break the record, he could wind up with his own island, Adidas  says, as soon as reasonably possible.  </p><p>Or Adidas could also just pay the athlete $1 million.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, Jared, that's -- that's pretty incredible.  I want  to switch gears and ask you about Warren Buffett announcing yesterday that  employees have a chance to win a million dollars for a year for life.  They  only have to predict the correct Sweet 16 for the NCAA men's basketball  tournament.  </p><p>What do you think about that?  Do you think somebody will actually predict  the Sweet 16 perfectly? </p><p>MAX:  That's -- that's unlikely.  I mean, that's predicting 16 out of 16  from a field that (ph) starts with, what, 68 teams.  </p><p>But they've done this contest before Warren Buffett -- last year, Warren  Buffett had -- he gave out $50,000 to two different employees for each  guessing the most correct picks during the NCAA tournament.  And there was  also a time when he gave away money for the most consecutive picks during  the tournament.  </p><p>I love seeing these new contests that -- that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>MAX:  .are going on in sports.  I mean, this Adidas thing and you know,  this -- it's cool stuff.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Who's going to predict the perfect Sweet 16?  Come on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's mathematically impossible almost.  It's literally  impossible to predict the Sweet 16.  There's no chance in a pot fiery hell  (ph).</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No wonder Buffett says you can have a million dollars.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's why -- that's why he's making -- that's why he's making  the offer.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  That's right, exactly.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  No way (ph) beyond (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  .are in his favor (ph).  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared, pretty -- pretty tough odds there.  Jared  Max, thank you.

Welcome back.   Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo right  here in D.C.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump will address a joint session of  congress tonight for the first time as commander-in-chief.  The president  is expected to stress unity during his speech, however before taking the  stage the president blamed his predecessor for tensions in the country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that President Obama  is behind it because his people are certainly behind it.  And some of the  leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks which are  really very serious leaks because they're very bad in terms of national  security.  But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him  being behind things, that's politics, and it will probably continue.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's speech tonight, the address begins at 9:00 pm Eastern and we  will be there live with analysis for you right after.  A miraculous story  of survival, a small plane crashes into a home killing three people but a  cheerleader onboard is alive this morning.  The details coming up.  Target  shares sinking in premarket this morning, the retail admits expectations on  both revenue and earnings.</p><p> The stock is plummeting down 13 percent, we will break down the numbers  coming up.  And Oh Snap, the parent company of Snapchat expected debut on  Wall Street Thursday.  What you need to know ahead of the highly  anticipated IPO in environment where we haven't seen a lot of IPOs.   Meanwhile, it could be a record day on Wall Street today.  Take a look at  futures indicating a flat opening this morning, this has been the situation  every morning and yet at the end of the day we see another record-high  close.  Another gain today would be a 13th record close in a row that is  never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.</p><p> In Europe this morning stocks are searching for direction, take a look at  Eurozone indices with the FT 100 up just a fraction in the CAC Quarante.   And the DAX Index lower.  And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a  look, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the weakest link down 3/4 of 1  percent.  Well, a tweet maybe to blame for the for biggest mistake in Oscar  history  Plus the best picture snafu not only thing plaguing the years'  award shows.  The details after Hollywood's big night delivers a ratings  bomb.</p><p> All of those stories coming up.  And joining me this morning to talk all  about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's  global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Fox News Contributor, Rachel  Campos-Duffy.  Good to see you.</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show so far you guys.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.  A lot of  excitement building up before the president gives his second big speech.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've been great in terms of really outlining what's  important tonight.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  More spending on military, more spending on  infrastructure, less spending on domestic programs and importantly, the  state department outreach to rest of the world, America first.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen?  You're absolutely right.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And don't forget, we're going to all be  looking to see what Melania Trump is wearing tonight.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's important.  That's important. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And also that President Trump is not going to touch Medicare or  Social Security which was something that he said on the campaign trail but  to people worried about the national debt and the looming tidal wave of the  tsunami of the entitlement programs.  I think that that's of note and of  concern.  And by the way, I still want to point out that if this president  and this congress gets bogged down in the repeal and replace of Obamacare  and you start getting toward the end of 2017, with a tax reform, that's  going to be not good news for the markets.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's why, you know, we're talking about the market  potentially a record 13th straight day of increases is -- at some point the  market is going to stay -- is going to ask is it delivering, are we -- are  we getting what he -- what he promised?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And a lot of hangs in the balance.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about that this morning. Joining the  conversation, former chief of staff under President Clinton, Mack McLarty  is with us this morning.  President George W. Bush's former undersecretary  of defense for policy, Doug Feith is with us and the host of Varney and  Company, Stuart Varney will weigh in as well.  We got a big program ahead.   So just stay with us for this hour.  We kick it off right now with our top  story and that is the president set to outline this is agenda tonight on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  During his  address to a joint session of congress tonight.  Peter Barnes is live at  the White House right now with the details.  Peter, good morning to you.</p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning,  Maria.  That's right.  We got more details from the president aides about  tonight's speech, they say the president will talk about his  accomplishments during his first month or so here in office including those  executive orders and possibly talks about companies, about keeping and  creating jobs in the United States, he will also discuss that range of  issues that you just mentioned.  And maybe he'll take a little credit for  the stock market and those recent records he did on Fox and Fiends this  morning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  You take a look at what's going on with the stock market, trillions  of dollars of value have been created since I won election, I mean  trillions, and -- in fact it was very interesting on Friday, it looked like  for the first time in 11 or 12 sessions the market might go down a little  bit and it was down, down, down, it was like 15 seconds left and all of a  sudden it shut up.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES:  Now, the big initiative he'll discuss tonight of course is his  plan to ask congress for $54 billion in additional spending on defense, his  aides say that the 10 percent increase, defense stocks have been up on that  news and administration official also saying the broad theme of the speech  tonight is the renewal of the American spirit and an optimistic vision for  all Americans, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you so much.  Peter Barnes with the  latest there.  I want to bring in Mack McLarty right now, he is former  chief of staff under President Clinton.  Mack it's good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p> MACK MCLARTY, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Maria, always  good to be with you.  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you want to hear from the President tonight.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  I'd like to hear really, first, the concrete outline of what he's  going to do, I think the speech will be more positive.  I think he will  call for unity, how that proceeds, we'll have to wait and see.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what -- let me -- look, we know roughly speaking that he  wants to increase military spending, we know that roughly speaking he wants  to come out with a tax plan and repeal and replace Obamacare, are you  onboard with those initiatives? </p><p> MCLARTY:  Not totally.  I think he will lay out his framework, you know,  the president proposes the congress disposes, and so he will lay out his  framework, it will work its way through the congress and the various  committees.  I think there's already been concern expressed about the very  substantial increase in the military budget.  We all want to support our  troops, we've had 15 years of war, equipment been depleted, there's no  question.</p><p> On the other hand is someone who had the privilege to work with president,  who did balance the budget.  I am concerned about the budget and the impact  there and you even have the military speaking about not weakening the state  department.  It's essentially we have soft diplomacy and engagement as well  as strong military power.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Jon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Can we talk about the White House, you ran a White House,  there is a lot of different factions in this White House, we have -- we  have budget hawks, we have the populous wing of Bannon, we have  nationalists, what is your read of how this -- how this White House is  operating and the factions there, is it any different than anything you --  that you saw when you running the White House?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, lift-offs are always a challenge in any White House and  President Trump came from outside, Governor Clinton came from being a  governor.  After 12 years the republicans being in office, but I think  Reince Priebus is capable, first, he knows Washington, there are always  power senators in Washington.  This is not unique to Trump administration  but they need to prioritize and get a handle on what they're doing and move  forward with their plan not unlike what Maria just outlined on the speech  and this is a  good evening to do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And are they all in line do you think?  I mean, when you look  at what the priorities are from counselors around him to his Chief of Staff  Reince Priebus?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, Maria, a couple of points.  I think you want different  points of view in any White House, any president wants different or CEOs or  whatever.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't want yes men around.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  But the -- but the challenge for Chief Priebus is to be an honest  broker, and it's the same thing with the national security advisor to take  those different views, put them in a form that gives the president the  option to making decision and then close on a decision.  That's what  important in any platform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  How will the democrats going to treat -- </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, we were talking about that earlier, I hope carefully and  nimbly, I mean, if he calls for more jobs, do you stand and applaud for  that or not?  And so it's going to be tricky for them, I think they need to  pick their disagreements so to speak very carefully.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you make a great point and it's a good question  because tonight we know that there will be protesters outside.  Tonight we  know that there will be guests of certain democrats who may actually, you  know, resist what the president's policies are.  How should President Trump  handle that?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, he's had some practice at handling it during the campaign.   And it could play in his favour.  I hope though tonight, not to be  pollyannaish but I hope deny, I mean, it's a serious address about serious  issues.  It's a call for unity, it's a very serious thoughtful speech and  it's received in that manner.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think there are some dangers for the democrats in this, I  mean, some of the guests that they've invited are people we would expect  but there is talk that they may have given some of these extra tickets to  protesters who may jump up and we saw the reaction that, you know, when Joe  Wilson said, you lie, you know, I mean, people do expect the sense of  decorum and respect for the office of president and should something happen  that's very disruptive or disrespectful, you know, we see the numbers for  the -- whole numbers saying that the country is moving -- saying that we're  moving in the right direction, what happens to democrats if they just look  like the party of resistance of disruption, and just really trying to put a  stop to him even just getting off the ground and even with -- Barack Obama  looking like he's beating this maybe from a few miles away.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  I would take a little exception to your final point but I think  your other points were appropriately made and if you look at the  democratically governors, association and their comments, they made very  much -- as very much the same thing that you just echoed, we've got to be  for something else as democrats.  We got to before a growth agenda, how are  we going to get this economy moving that includes everybody.  So they just  can't be against President Trump.  They need to pick and pick their battles  very carefully.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do they have that?  I mean, is there something that they're  for other than being against Donald Trump?</p><p> MCLARTY:  Oh, I think you're seeing that emerge, Maria.  And I think it's  frankly, early in Trump administration and early in terms of the democrats  getting all of their programs together and moving forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You said -- you said you take issue with what Rachel just said.   I want to play you a sound bite from President Trump and he basically says  no, President Obama is behind some of this.  Listen to this.</p><p> MCLARTY:  OK.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it, I also think it's politics, that's the  way it is and look I have a -- </p><p> BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  But bush wasn't going  after Clinton, Clinton wasn't going after bush.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes,  you know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  You  know, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people is  certainly are behind it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  is it -- is it a stretch to say that his people are behind the  protesters and loyalists to President Obama?</p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, I think there is some natural disagreement from people that  supported President Obama or perhaps when President Obama's administration.   I think President Trump said you never know is probably the key phrase but  to say I think and suggest that President Obama is personally engaged, I  don't think there is any real evidence to suggest that's the case. </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's definitely encouraged it through statements that he  made and I would say that it's -- I don't think we should normalize a  president -- an ex-president not really sort of giving the new president a  chance to -- I mean this is a highly unusual the level of involvement and I  mean, most presidents sort of recede into background.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, President Bush certainly did and President Clinton did  although President Trump has been pretty critical of President Obama, so in  this counter punching narrative that President Trump has put forward, you  could -- you could say that but I don't expect President Obama to be  actively engaged.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So tonight, it will be a success if? </p><p> MCLARTY:  If one --it's a positive speech as kind of -- as of kind of a  Ronald Reaganess or Bill Clintoness, positive view, let's move forward  together and it has some specific and it -- that at least have some  possibility for common ground of bipartisan support.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Mack, good to see you.</p><p> MCLARTY:  We'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Mack McLarty there, Fox  Business is taking you live to the president's joint address to congress  tonight 9:00 pm Eastern, so stay with us as we have a full coverage  tonight.</p><p> Coming up.  We will Snapchat and will company have a picture-perfect debut  on Wall Street, new details on Snap's hotly anticipated IPO.  Target stocks  sinking in the premarket down 13 percent after disappointing fourth  quarter, a closer look at the company's earnings.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane crashing into two houses in  Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So, Maria fire officials say one  teenager was thrown from a backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl  only had minor injuries.  Three people were killed when the aircraft  crashed shortly after taking off from Riverside Municipal Airport.  The  cell phone video caught the moment of the crash, you can see huge flames  and thick smoke following that explosion.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the backhouse of the neighbors, they're exiting an elderly man,  exiting firefighters were taking people to safety.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on that plane.   They were flying home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  </p><p> Well, analysts at UBS say the Costco may boost their membership fee in the  next few months.  UBS putting out a note to investors saying the warehouse  chain fees for basic membership likely going to increase by $5 that means  it will be $60.  UBS is the fee for a Costco executive membership going to  rise by 10, they will make it 120 every year.  It affirms that Costco might  announce those hikes on Thursday when they release a second quarter  earnings.</p><p> Costco recently did increase their membership fees by 10 percent in other  countries, they did it in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico even the U.K.   Costco has not confirmed it but during an earnings call in December, the  CEO said the time might be actually ripe for that fee hike, so we'll see on  Thursday.  Well, President Donald Trump preparing to address a joint  session of congress for the first time tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming up.  We have to  understand Obamacare has been a disaster.  It's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border and remember  this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting the bad ones  out, the bad people.  Gang members, druglords, and some cases murderers.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  And the president also we should say expected to declare early  progress on his campaign promises.  Well, let's take a look at Target  shares, they're being hit pretty hard this morning guys.  The company  reported sales and earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.  Target  was hurt by a disappointing holiday quarter, we talking about it this  morning.  There is the stock.  Earnings came in buck 45 a share, they  missed the estimate 1.51, they also said the outlook for fiscal year 2017  is also, Maria, going to miss analysts expectation.  So it was about the  holiday quarter certainly the retailers under pressure because of folks  like Amazon.  And those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure that's it.  Tough quarter for Target.  Thank you  so much, Cheryl.  And we are back with our panel, Dagen McDowell, Jon  Hilsenrath, Rachel Campos-Duffy.  Tonight, the big night.  First time we'll  hear from the president since inauguration day, Rachel.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Absolutely.  And, you know, this is the prime time address.   It's not in the middle of the day, expect huge ratings, expect them to talk  about these ratings especially with -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  God, you're right.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  -- the Oscar ratings down, I think he's going to take a lot  of pleasure in seeing his own ratings going up.  This guy knows how to do a  show, he's very unpredictable.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think it's going to be very interesting, I know I  mentioned Melania and Ivanka in what they're going to wear, listen, this is  a huge rebound of the image for the republican party, highly fashionable  women.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think -- I think it's -- I think this is the real moment  for the republicans.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  There's two things on that we're looking at.  One is, there's  going to be so much attention in who's in the gallery above all these  dignitaries down on the floor.  So much talk about who the democrats are  inviting, who republicans are inviting.  I think we're going to hear more  about that that than we usually do.  That's one thing.  The other thing,  something we've been talking about all morning, Maria is immigration, what  is the president's stand on immigration.  You've been distinguishing -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We know where it stands on immigration.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  No, no.  But this is -- but this is the important point  between legal and illegal immigration.  If we're going to hit growth  targets of three percent or more, we actually need more legal immigration  and not less of it because the population is aging and --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Yes.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- because we have all these baby boomers retiring.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  The barrier has always been the wall and that's what -- and  border security.  So, if you want immigration reform, you first have to  secure the border and I think that's something -- he's a populist because  that's actually very popular to secure our border and getting out violent  criminals and other very popular.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very popular.  Absolutely.  Dagen, I mean, look, we have been  talking about differentiating legal from illegal because in some of the  circles here, particularly the democrats bringing their guest tonight,  they're confusing it.  I mean, as if the president doesn't want legal  immigration.  I mean, has he said he doesn't want legal -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That -- this has been the opportunity for him to make that  distinction of the liberals and the democrats always talk about immigration  as a whole, that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about  securing the homeland period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  Still ahead President Trump seeks to  beef up the nation's military.  Meanwhile, the defense spending increase  expected in the White House as first fiscal budget.  That budget will be  out in the next week.  And then, the biggest technology IPOs since  Facebook.  Everything you need to know about Snap's hotly anticipated Wall  Street debut this week.  Back in a moment.  .  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Wall Street gears up for one of the biggest  intelligent IPOs in years, Snap, the parent company Snapchat however is not  expected to follow the same path as other social media giants that have  gone public like Facebook and Twitter.  Unlike other Silicon Valley giants,  Snap does not have a headquarters and its cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel is  an unconventional leader, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Jon  Hilsenrath here today, taking a look at it.  How will the Snap's IPO you  think be different than Facebook.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, our story today is all about the unusual  leadership of Snap CEO who is not a very open communicative person, doesn't  like to have big meetings with his -- with his staff.  So, I think there's  going to be some questions about management, how is -- how is management  going to run the company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I tell you one thing that he got right, not to sell for  $3 billion back in the day, right?  Who offered $3 billion and then -- and  remember the -- oh, this is just crazy.  Why would you not sell?  You just  offered $3 billion and here he is with a $20 plus billion IPO.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's engaged to Miranda Kerr, the actress who's Orlando  Bloom former homegirl if you will.  So there you go.  So we know that about  him, there might be a lose but he's got a model on his arm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think it's a -- it's a big test for Wall Street because this  is our first big tech IPO in a while and, you know, we have to see if Wall  Street really embraces this like the Facebook.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that's a great point because this is not a good IPO  period right now.  It is not a lot of I big deals.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  It hasn't been but Wall Street is on fire now.  So if we get a  very hot IPO out of Snap and it could be something that adds a little  momentum.  </p><p> CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  I'll tell you who's embracing it, it is young people, I  mean, my teens are on, you know, they love this stock.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But how loyal will they be two years from now, even two months  from now. </p><p> CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  They move on to another thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Look at this.  Is it -- is it Facebook or is it Twitter  is going to be big question --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- to buy the IPO -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Rich Peterson, it has to be capitalized uses, looks as if  February 2017 will be the lowest monthly count of IPOs since March when --  of '16 when just four IPOs price.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And how o do you reconcile that with the fact that -- look at  -- look at the NASDAQ, look how high it is, you know, you would think in a  market like this that more companies will be coming out in IPOing, so if  you get a good one out of Snap then you might see some others following  behind it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I wondered why because normally you want to go public when the  markets are rallying and when it's really strong performance and yet you're  just not seeing that.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And maybe it's a sign that this momentum we're  seeing in the market is not sustainable.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we'll see, I mean, look, the markets are waiting for tax  reform, right, Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we will be talking about this forever here, but we're up 13  percent since election day.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And you've also seen the bonds rising along with stocks  which is unusual, so somebody is wrong in that equation, either gross loss  either or risky assets, you know, risk your assets.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  We had a story in the paper just yesterday about how a better  reversal, we're starting to see people buying bonds again which is another  --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.  I said bonds rising.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Prices are rising, yields are falling which is a sign  that maybe people are starting to question the kind of growth that --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hey, I read the journal, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Oh, I know.  I know you do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And she's been talking about that for some time as well.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, building a better defense,  President Trump's pledge to increase military spending.  Where the money  will come to from to pay for it.  And then a bigger buyout of Apple, why  Warren Buffet is doubling down on Apple shares.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, this morning in Washington.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump, set to  address the Joint Session of Congress tonight, for the first time since  taking office.  The Commander in Chief is expected to address many issues,  including taking care of our veterans.  Earlier in the program I spoke with  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, about his role so far. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  I've been in government now  about 18 months, that's long enough to understand how this system works and  where the problems are.  And my discussions with the President have been  that we have to make these changes quickly, and being able to know where  the problems are, is going to allow us to do that as quick as we need to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  address tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, join are us throughout the day today,  for full analysis as well.  As the President prepares to address Congress,  his Cabinet is one step closer to being complete.  The Senate confirming  Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, in a 72 to 27 vote last night.  He will  be sworn into office this morning.  Target shares are sinking in the pre- market, the retailer missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per  share.  We have breaking down numbers, coming up. </p><p> Warren Buffett, meanwhile, taking a big bite out of Apple: why the  billionaire invertor's betting big on Apple shares?  And it could be a  record day on Wall Street, Futures indicating: markets will open like this.   We are off of the highs and certainly, we're pretty flat to the -- to the  break-even line.  If we do see a record today, because this has been the  case open: we open lower, and then by the end of the day, close higher.   The gain would be a 13th record close, in a row, that has never happened in  the Dow's 120-year history.  </p><p> We're just getting breaking news right now; fourth quarter GDP is out.  The  fourth quarter grew at a rate of 1.9 percent, this is the second estimate;  this is below expectations.  The estimate calls for growth of 2.1 percent.   The GDP hitting the tape right now: markets, as you see, are reacting.  In  Europe, stocks are searching for direction this morning, take a look at  Eurozone indices and you will see fractional moves up in London and in  Paris, but even the DAX Index actually has turned positive.  The European  markets are actually, trading higher even if just by a fraction.  </p><p> And in Asia, overnight, markets were mixed, take a look, the big loser  there was the Hang Seng in Hong Kong: down three quarters of one percent.   Well, a picture of Kellyanne Conway, goes viral, but will the White House  take the criticism sitting down?  We'll talk about that picture, that's  going viral.  Plus, a tweet maybe to blame, a tweet for the biggest mistake  in Oscar history.  Why the man in charge, of the envelopes, may have been  more concerned with social media, and sending out tweets and pictures than  handing over the right envelope.  Our top story this half hour, President  Trump focusing on defense.  Trump is seeking a historic $54 billion  increase in defense spending, while pursuing cuts everywhere else.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  40 days, after his inauguration, President Trump and  Republican Congress will have -- not lifted a finger to create jobs, raise  wages for hardworking American families.  These actions will worsen the  conditions that fueled his candidacy, President Trump engaged in a bait and  -- a bait and switch agenda: no jobs, no retirement security, and no health  security.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.  I just want to point out that he is seeking cuts  elsewhere, but not everywhere else, pardon me on that.  Joining us right  now is the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, under Bush 43,  Doug Feith is with us.  Under Secretary, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p> DOUG FEITH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE FOR POLICY UNDER SECRETARY UNDER GEORGE  W. BUSH:  Glad to be with you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  So, the President says, he wants the U.S. to be  better prepared if called to fight.  What's your take on these expectations  that he wants to raise military spending by $54 billion? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, the defense budget was pretty severely slashed throughout the  Obama administration, and the Unites States continues to have large  worldwide defense responsibilities.  But we have not had a budget in recent  years that allow us to -- that allows us to actually, have the kind of  military capabilities that would allow to us fulfill responsibilities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you want to see this?  You want to see more spending on  military then?  </p><p> FEITH:  I do.  I think it's an important thing, I think that we have large  parts of our infrastructure.  There -- recently, there've been some  attention paid to how our nuclear infrastructure for example, has  deteriorated greatly.  That's enormously dangerous, if countries around the  world that have depended on Unites States for decades, for their security  because of our nuclear umbrella?  Begin to worry about the integrity of our  nuclear umbrella, because we haven't been investing enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FEITH:  That's -- that makes for a much more dangerous world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure does.  Dagen?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration's proposal will take the defense budget  to $603 billion, that's still short of say, what a Senator John McCain  wants, which is closer to $640 billion.  Do you think that the Trump  administration should do even more, in terms of increasing the defense  spending?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, there're a lot of details to be debated, but I think that  what Senator McCain has said, Representative Thornberry has said in the  House, have to be taken seriously.  That there's going to be a debate  between mysterious people in Congress that are looking to pitch on the  Armed Services Committees in the House, and the Senate, and the  administration, and I think there is a strong argument to be made that the  administration has not gone far enough.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's going to be a debate within Trump administration  too because Mick Mulvaney, who's the Budget Director, has been kind of a  deficit hawk.  And that's one of the reasons that Senator McCain didn't  trickily care for.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Well, and I think that people are perfectly happy with  seeing us upgrade airplanes, and our ships, and armor for our troops, but a  lot of people see that there's some fat to be cut in the Pentagon.  And so,  maybe, sort of being, in between where Barack Obama was, and not quite  where John McCain wants him to be, means that, you know, military will have  to find ways where they can streamline in, and do things more efficiently,  so they can, you know, meet budget cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can he do that?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, it's -- this is a perennial question.  It's always a good  idea to cut fat.  I don't think that you're going to be able to solve the  problem simply by cutting the fat.  The amount of -- the serious harm that  was done, by the see quest ration cuts throughout the Obama years needs to  be remedied.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that.  I mean, go through for us the more  important areas of the military where you believe need love, frankly?  I  mean, we've got the oldest navy in decades, oldest army in decades, how you  characterize and assess where we we're today, and what needs to be done? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I mean, I think you flag some of the major issues, the our --  our navy needs more platforms, we need more capabilities in basically all  of the services.  We have -- we have for example, in Asia, had a policy  that at the beginning of the Bush administration we said, the real  strategic interests of the Unites States, require us to build up our  capabilities in Asia.  Some work was done in that regard.  Then President  Obama came in, and made the point about pivoting to Asia, which was a way  of essentially reaffirming, that we need to do more to focus on our  strategic interests in Asia, because Asia is both economically and  strategically enormously important.  In order to do what we need to do in  Asia, we need long range military capabilities, that's air capabilities,  naval capabilities, and the like.  All of that is enormously expensive and  requires us to build up our forces.  </p><p> DUFFY:  Donald Trump has said that he's -- he's asking these other  countries that have been benefiting from our military expenditures to step  up.  So, is that going to reduce some of the financial pressure on us? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I think that -- President Trump has said some things that I  think have some merit, and are also a problem.  </p><p> DUFFY:  OK.  </p><p> FEITH:  What he said that has merit is, what every American President in  basically since the cold war began, was saying, which is we would like  greater contributions from our allies.  That's another perennial debate.  </p><p> DUFFY:  But he seems to mean it, right?</p><p> FEITH:  Well, he has -- he has also said some things that I think were  really not constructive, and not accurate, about how some of our key allies  are free loaders.  I don't think that's a fair -- I don't think that's a  fair description.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you reassured by General Mattis, running the Defense  Department though?  Because he has gone against things that his boss,  President Trump has said, whether it's about torture, whether it's where  not taking Iraq's oil, whether it's standing by our NATO allies, does that  reassure you? </p><p> FEITH:  It does.  I think that General Mattis is understanding of the  importance of our alliances, is far more sound than the campaign rhetoric  that came from Mr. Trump, during the campaign, and even unfortunately some  of the things he said since he's been President.  But I hope that he -- I  hope that President Trump will take advice on what remains to be seen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How has that comment about what you just said, free loaders?   How has that impacted our friends across the world?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I think -- I mean in my conversations with representatives  from a number of those countries, it has made them question whether  President Trump is going to continue to uphold the relationships, continue  to uphold the alliance obligations that we have.  And we -- I don't think  it is in our interests that we call those alliances into question.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What if -- what if some of them should be paying off, right?   How do get to do that? </p><p> FEITH:  As I said, it's been -- it has been a perennial problem that we've  encouraged and not always successfully, our allies to contribute more.  I  am happy to see that some of -- many of our allies are responding to Mr.  Trump by saying that they're going to increase their defense spending.   That's a positive thing, and I give -- I give President Trump credit for  that.  But, you know, this needs to be calibrated correctly to put the  pressure on the allies without making them question fundamentally, whether  we are going to remain true to our commitments.  </p><p> DUFFY:  It's definitely about that, but I can tell you that it really  resonates with the American people, when they hear Donald Trump tell them:  you have to care more about your liberty and freedom than we do.  And I  think that -- and Americans feel like, some of them are free loaders.  And  I don't know what a President can -- how do you strike that balance between  making them feel like, you know, we're not going -- we're not going to  leave you, that at the same time, putting enough pressure verbally on them.   At least, to get them to pay their fair share.  </p><p> FEITH:  You know, I see the -- I see the populist appeal of that kind of  rhetoric.  But I think it's very short sided because, what I am focused on,  is the interests of the American people.  It is not in our interests to  have our allies doubt our reliability.  That ultimately is not a way to  punish allies that you think are not contributing enough, we're going to be  punishing ourselves if we damage these alliances -- these alliances.  </p><p> And I really think that a responsible American official would be making  this clear to the American public.  These alliances, have kept the security  situation relatively quiet around a large part of the world, to be enormous  benefit of the American people.  It has created a platform on which an  enormous amount of economic growth has occurred, where trade occurs.  And  if we damage that general structure for security in the world, we are  damaging our own economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, of course.  Great to have your insights, Doug.  Thanks so  much.  We appreciate you joining us today.  Under Secretary, Doug Feith,  joining us.  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  Joint Address to Congress tonight.  Join us, for our special coverage all  day, and leading up to the address at 9:00 p.m. tonight.  And we'll be live  here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to have full analysis tomorrow morning.</p><p> Coming up next, markets setting new records under President Trump, but the  mainstream media is focused on the backlash against the President.  Stuart  Varney, sounds off, has some thoughts on that, he's coming up.  Plus, a  Kellyanne Conway photo not sitting well with some of her critics.  Why a  picture of the White House Adviser is going viral this morning.  Back in a  moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are flat this morning although we are  expecting a couple of big movers.  Warren Buffett for example is taking a  bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stake in Apple is now  more than double what it was at the start of the year.  Berkshire now owns  133 million shares of Apple, it's up from 57 million.  It certainly made  money on that move.  Berkshire Hathaway stake is now about $18 billion.   Take a look at Apple shares right now at $137.05 a share in the premarket.</p><p> We're watching Amazon today.  Time Magazine reporting that the company is  working to give its voice assistance, Alexa, the ability to distinguish who  is talking to it.  The report says that the capability which is being  called Voice I.D., has been in development since 2015.  Amazon shares up  almost three percent this morning in the premarket. </p><p> Markets are poised for their 13th straight record breaking day.  But the  mainstream media seems to be giving the Trump rally the cold shoulder.  A  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, joins us from New York.  How do  you give this market the cold shoulder?  13 percent since Election Day, six  percent since the start of the year, Stu.  Wow.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\":  Yes.  And by the way, if we  close, just even one point higher today, it will be truly an historic event  on Wall Street because we've never seen 13 consecutive records in the 120- year history of the Dow Industrials.  Now, look at this, I've got the New  York Times.  I actually paid for a copy this morning, here it is.  It's not  on front page.  No mention of the Wall Street rally. The Trump rally, no  mention whatsoever on the front page.  So, I turned to the business  section.  It's called Business Day.  Not a single notion. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you kidding me? </p><p> VARNEY:  Not a mention.  You go to page B7, to find any mention of the  rally.  I'm looking for it -- fast here.  And it says, \"Wall street closes  at new highs again.\"  It's tucked down at the bottom corner of B7.  So  then, I splashed out big time, went to the Washington Post.  Here it is.   Not on the front page.  They do have an economy section on page eight.   Well what do you think the lead is in the Washington Post on this historic  day?  I will tell you, it is Apple shareholders all set to vote on whether  to force the company to make its leadership more diverse. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> I rest my case.  If this is not the dishonest media.  You know, this is  total dishonesty. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's only $3 trillion in market wealth that has been created.   What do you want?  A whole story on it?  It's only $3 trillion.</p><p> VARNEY:  A trillion here, a trillion there.  Pretty soon, you're talking  big money.  You know what I mean, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  I think so.</p><p> VARNEY:  Look, if people are not watching Fox Business, Maria, Stuart and  everybody else, they wouldn't know that history is being made in our  economy, on our markets, they would not know it.  100 million people will  benefit directly from what we've seen on Wall Street, no mention.   Dishonesty. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Transparency is the issue.</p><p> VARNEY:  My rant is over, OK.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right, no.  And there is the issue, you are not getting  the full story.  That's the point.  Stuart, thank you.  I know you have  more on this in about 10 minutes and we will see you then. </p><p> VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern.   Thank you. Stuart, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> Coming up next, ruining the Oscars in 140 characters or less.  Why Twitter  may be to blame for the Best Picture mix-up at the Academy Awards. </p><p> Then, critics claiming that Kellyanne Conway is not putting her best foot  forward in the oval office.  The picture of the White House Adviser going  viral this morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, get this if.  If photo of White House  Adviser, Kellyanne Conway, is going viral this morning, there's the photo.   Social media erupted after the picture emerged of Conway with her feet on a  couch in the Oval Office.  Joining us right now is political analyst,  Kirsten Haglund, to talk more about this.  Kirsten, good to see you first  of all. </p><p> KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ADVISOR:  Good to see you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us.  So, what do you think?  Are her critics  making a big deal out of nothing or does this bother you?</p><p> HAGLUND:  No, this is completely outrageous.  There is about 52,000 tweets  as of this morning about this particular incident.  You know what is just  sad is that it's such a really, really great meeting that's going on in the  Oval Office where that picture is being taken.  It's a meeting with  President Trump, as you can see, with leaders from historically black  colleges and universities.  It's just a really, really incredible thing and  they're shining the spotlight on something that really doesn't even matter.   And I should say, conservatives are quick to jump on President Obama when  he had photo taken of him in the Oval Office with a feet up on the desk or  his feet on the table next to couch.  This is political fodder, we expect  them to do.  But nothing's worse than what happened with Bill Clinton the  in oval office, so I think that people can give Kellyanne a break. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.  Do  we see that kind of reaction to the antics there with Bill Clinton and  Monica Lewinsky and then some?  But then again, Dagen, he put her feet on  the couch in the Oval Office.  How about some respect?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Momma McDowell would say, \"Don't put your feet on the  furniture.\" </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Particularly if it's the Oval Office.  The optics of this are  bad.  And President Trump understands optics better than anybody.  About --  I mean, he is a great showman that does not represent his administration  well.  I don't feel like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do we know if she has her shoes on or is she walking around  there? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think if you're -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  I don't know if her shoes are on.  She's clearly trying to take a  better picture.  There are White House photographers there.  She didn't  need taking that picture, she certainly doesn't need it.  I -- listen, I  hate saying this, I'm a big Kellyanne fun, but I have kids, I would be  furious if they sat like that at the neighbor's house, let alone in the  Oval Office. </p><p> FEITH:  Either has her shoes on or her shoes are on the couch. </p><p> HAGLUND:  Which is bad. </p><p> FEITH:  Worse is walking around the Oval Office with no shoes on.  Which is  also -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  Which is bad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, there is a lot of people there, right?  I mean,  this is like an important meeting happening. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's the head of historic black colleges.  That makes it that  much worse, so -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  Listen -- </p><p> FEITH:  It's disrespectful to them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll cruise that both sides of the aisle.  And I don't think  that President Obama should have his feet on the desk and I don't think her  feet should be on this oval.</p><p> HAGLUND:  And I don't think my feet should also be in the Oval Office  either.  So, I think it's all bad. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's abridged, real far. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Totally agree.  What we want Kirsten, what about this.  We're  learning more about the big blunder, here around the world.  The wrong  movie awarded Best Picture at the Oscars.  So, here's what we know.  The  PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, he is to blame because just minutes  before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong envelope, he tweeted out  a photo of the Best Actress winner, Emma Stone, backstage.  </p><p> The award mix-up happened just three minutes later.  Now, Cullinan's  backstage tweets were reportedly not sanctioned by the Academy and he later  deleted the tweet along with other posts during the show.  So, what about  that Kirsten?  Do you think he deleted the tweets because he didn't want  people to think, \"You were focused on your tweets and you gave Warren  Beatty the wrong envelope,\" which is actually what happened.</p><p> HAGLUND:  Absolutely.  And I'm sure he didn't want PricewaterhouseCoopers  to find out as well.  You know, first I felt bad for this guy.  I thought,  \"Oh, don't publish his name.  Don't publish his photo.  He probably feels  awful already.\"  But then you see these pictures coming out and of course,  you know, you're backstage at a once in a lifetime opportunity, you want to  catch that shot and you want to post it but, you know, people get in  trouble with their posting.  </p><p> Do you know that in the last couple of years, there've been 127 deaths from  people trying to take selfies?  So, you know, we have to be really careful  with what we post, you know.  So, I mean, I originally felt bad for the guy  but you know, you're there to do your job.  You're paid to do one thing  right and look at what happened.  So, I don't think he'll be handing out  envelopes next year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I feel bad for it because I know that when we're live on TV,  I'm over here and I want to get something that our guests said immediately  out.  I want to make sure my followers know what was just said on the show.   I tweeted out really quickly but the truth is, this is to make a big  mistake because you're focusing on too many things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's your show, though.  It's your show.  That one will show.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  All right, Kirsten Haglund, good to see  you.  We'll be right back with the final thoughts from our All-Star panel,  right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks to our fantastic panel, see you all tomorrow everybody.   \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Here's Stuart.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Welcome back, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from Washington, D.C. this morning  ahead of the President's address tonight.  It is Tuesday, February 28th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> President Trump set to address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time since taking office.  While the Commander-in-Chief is expected  to stress unity during that speech, the guests at the event showed  division.</p><p> President Trump's guests will include victims of illegal immigrant crime  while Democrats have invited immigrants and refugees.  Democrats were on  the attack against President Trump ahead of tonight's speech.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER:  40 days after his inauguration,  President Trump and the Republican congress will have not lifted a finger  to create jobs or raise wages for hard-working families.</p><p> These actions were worst than the conditions that fueled his candidacy.

We are coming off of 12 straight record closes for the markets  and today could be a 13th.  Take a look at these markets.  We are looking  at fractional moves right now.

A gain today on the Dow Industrials would be a 13th record high  for this market which would break the record.</p><p> In Europe meanwhile, take a look at markets.  Stocks are searching for  direction this morning.  European indices up fractionally in London and  Paris but down fractionally in Germany.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, as you'll see here again, fractional  moves.

So do stay with us this morning.</p><p> President Trump set to detail his health care and immigration policies as  part of his agenda for his address to a joint session of Congress today.   Members of the House and Senate will not be the only ones in attendance.   Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will  join first lady Melania Trump at the address.</p><p> Lawmakers are also allowed to bring guests to the President's address.   Some House Democrats are using the opportunity to bring dreamers and other  guests who would be affected by President Trump's immigration policies.</p><p> Joining me right now are Tennessee Congresswoman Marcia Blackburn and Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan.  It's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p> REP. MARCIA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a big night. First time we are hearing from the President  since inauguration day.  What do you make of what's happening in terms of  the guests, Congresswoman Blackburn?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Everyone has the opportunity to bring someone; usually get  someone from their district, ties in some way with policies and discussions  that are going on.  And I just hope everyone remembers they are there as a  guest of the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about you Congressman Ryan?  </p><p> REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  Oh, I think it's important to highlight, this has  been a tradition whether it's the President -- who the President invites,  who the first lady invites, who members of Congress invite.  We are  highlighting the fact that there will be hundreds of thousands if not  millions of people thrown off of their health care if there's a complete  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p> And I think it's important to put faces to that policy issue and let people  look people in the eye and say, you're not going to be covered if we do a  straight repeal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we should point out that the President was very clear.   The President said that there's not going to be any interruption and people  will not lose their health care, actually.  That's what the President was  very clear about.  So I don't know -- </p><p> RYAN:  There was a Republican plan that was also put forward that said that  potentially millions of people were going to be thrown off.</p><p> Now, let's go back to the campaign where Trump campaigned at almost every  rally, Marcia and said we are going to rip it up, we're going to throw it  away, we're going to repeal this thing immediately.  He talked for a year  about doing that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not that he would throw anyone off the plan.  </p><p> RYAN:  Well, you can't do both.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Of course, you can do both.  </p><p> RYAN:  How?  What's the plan?  Tell us what the plan is.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  There is a way to go through this process and to make certain  that what we do is improve the options that are there.  And Tim, you know,  as well as I do, the goal is to make certain that everyone has access to  affordable health care.</p><p> Obamacare is imploding.  It's imploding and it is not affordable.  You can  look at the increase in the insurance rate.  You can talk to those that are  delivering health care and talk about the lack of reimbursement for the  care that is delivered.  And, Maria, the choice is, are you going to have a  system that implodes and have nothing?  Or are we going to fix this so that  there is access to affordable health care for all Americans.  That's the  choice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you attack this, Congressman, knowing that like in  places like Arizona we are seeing premium increases of 116 percent?   Families cannot afford this.  </p><p> RYAN:  Does it need tweak, fix?  I'm in.  Let's fix it.  There are  obviously issues with something this big, this comprehensive that will need  adjusted as we go, but the reality of it is when you talk about the  Medicaid expansion as John Kasich said on the weekend talk shows, the  governor of Ohio about how many hundreds of thousands of people -- about  700,000 in Ohio have benefited from the Medicaid expansion.  If you look at  the credits that are given to people to help them afford to be able to pay  for health care, those are essential elements of the health care.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you saying you don't want Obamacare touched?  Are you  saying you don't want Obamacare touched?</p><p> RYAN:  No, no, no.  I'm telling you we can fix it if there are undo premium  increases, if there are issues with competition.  How do we fix this?  Why  do we got to repeal it?  Why do you got to throw it out?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because it's too expensive it impacts economic growth.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p> RYAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's dismiss that real quick.  The  Congressional Budget Office -- hold on.  The Congressional Budget Office  said -- </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, I'm not going to let you get by with that.  I'm not going  to let you get by with that.</p><p> RYAN:  This will actually be -- no, no, no.  This is an important point.   You can't let this go unanswered.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your point?</p><p> RYAN:  The point is that the Congressional Budget Office said in the first  10 years that the Affordable Care Act actually brings down the deficit by  $100 plus billion; in the second ten years it's over a trillion dollars of  deficit reduction on the health care. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think we should have a plan for 20 years and just wait  until it actually -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> RYAN:  This isn't an either-or.  I don't know why it has to be an either- or.  We're all adults here.  Any other situation in your life is an either- or.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Here are the numbers.  If you have 22 million people in what is  the Obamacare realm, you have 11 million people, 12 million people that are  in the Medicaid expansion.  But then when you look at the exchange -- nine  million people, two million people can afford the product without a  subsidy, only two million people.  Seven million people can't afford it  unless they're getting a subsidy.  It is too expensive to afford.</p><p> Now, the other kicker in this is when people get it, you know, what they  say, we can't use it because the deductibles are so high, it's structurally  flawed.  It does not work.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  The deductibles are very (inaudible) that you're always  paying out of your pocket.  You could never actually reach that level.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  It turns out to be major medical.  </p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Can I just ask a quick  question?  So we saw some of the problems with Obamacare over the last four  years -- six years.  There were bills out to help fix some of these  problems.  Where were the Democrats in the fixes over the last five, six  years that the Republicans were putting forward?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good question.  </p><p> RYAN:  That's a very ironic question and the fact that they tried to do a  straight repeal.  How many votes?  60 something.  </p><p> DUFFY:  Some of those bills -- </p><p> RYAN:  And there was throughout the whole process of actually trying to put  it together, we got no cooperation from the Republicans at all.  We could  have very easily -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  60 percent of the people didn't want it.  60 percent of the  people didn't want it.  It was pretty clear the President basically went  around structures and pushed it through even though poll after poll showed  that people didn't want it.  </p><p> RYAN:  What structures.  It was the House and the Senate that voted on it.   All I'm saying is the Republicans fought this the entire way through.  If  we -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because their constituents didn't want it.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, they didn't even know what it was at that point.  And if they  were --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well Nancy Pelosi said let's pass it and then read it later.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  And then it gave the authority -- 1,400 times in that 2,300- page bill, it gives the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  Why did they do that?  Because they didn't want those items in  statute; they wanted to be able to go in and manipulate the system.  </p><p> RYAN:  Marcia -- that is such a misrepresentation of the process.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, it is not a misrepresentation.</p><p> RYAN:  There's nothing that we passed over here that we don't send to  executive branch and say you have to make rules for this.  You have to -- </p><p> BLACKBURN:  1,400 times of rules -- that's one of the -- </p><p> RYAN:  It's the American healthcare system.  You guys try to simplify this  and you're doing a disservice to the American people.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  That is incorrect.</p><p> RYAN:  This is a complicated issue.  Sit at the table and be a part of the  solution.  And you guys -- </p><p> Blackburn:  And we just tried to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the President didn't sit out at the table and try to be -- </p><p> RYAN:  He reached out to the Republicans through the entire process.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.</p><p> RYAN:  He couldn't get one Republican to sit and try to be a part of this. BARTIROMO:  You were there, did he reach out?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.  And then Energy and Commerce Committee,  Healthcare subcommittee where we did this, of course.  We have tried to  bring forward things that will improve the delivery of health care, that  will solve the problems whether it's reimbursement with CMS, whether it's  the 1115 waiver system.  And no, were we met with open arms from those on  the White House and the administration?  Absolutely not.</p><p> RYAN:  This is the biggest rewrite of history I've ever seen in my life.   The Republicans had no interest.  They used this as a political issue from  day one.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, there was a reason -- with all due respect --  there was a reason Donald Trump won the presidency.  The American people  were frustrated.  And they were upset by what was going on in Washington.   They were upset by the executive orders.  It probably was as much about  Barack Obama as it was about Hillary Clinton.  Do you agree with that?   That's the reason Donald Trump won?  </p><p> RYAN:  Barack Obama had a jobs' bill at the Congress for years.  He kept  trying to work with Republicans.  Look, don't take my word for it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  His priority was health care.  He pushed health  care through.  </p><p> RYAN:  Let's provide context for the viewer.  Mitch McConnell said my sole  responsibility is to make Barack Obama a one-term president.  That was the  top Republican in the Senate.  And from that comment and the behavior of  the Republicans in the House not working with the President, not working  with Democrats saying we are going to use this opportunity that the people  have given us to shut Barack Obama down and the Democrats.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that because -- </p><p> RYAN:  They weren't part of the process.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- he kept going around them, doing executive orders.</p><p> RYAN:  He went around them -- he went around them after that.  He went  around them after that after they showed no willingness to work.  And now  all of a sudden -- now all of a sudden every Republican in America -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DUFFY:  Now we are at the state of the Union, this joint session of  Congress we see this #Resist attitude coming, so are the Democrats going  look at what they perceive the Republicans did in terms of obstructing  Obama's agenda?  And are they going to say, we are going to do it  differently, we are going reach across the aisle, we're going to help the  country move forward for sure?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that?  What about that?</p><p> RYAN:  To be determined, I think.  Many of us including me, myself has said  from the very beginning, he's elected president, we should try to work with  him.  He did nothing in -- Maria, he campaigned on jobs, the economy, he  was going to open up the steel mills.  He was going to reopen the coal  mines and put people back to work.  Here we are, how many weeks later,  where is the trillion-dollar transportation bill? </p><p> Why would you pick -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  With all due respect it's been a month.  It's been a month.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, within a month, the Obama -- within a month we had -- we had  the stimulus bill passed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well you were in massive recession and it was like of urgent  need.  </p><p> RYAN:  Well, people in Youngstown voted for him because they are still in a  massive recession.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The point is though tonight a number Democrats are going to be  bringing legal immigrants here.  I don't understand why the grandstanding.   Why not go to the speech with your sleeves rolled up, ready to work, and  get the people's business done? </p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's the type of attitude that we would love to see.  </p><p> RYAN:  This is a complete reversal when President Obama was in, Marcia.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, it is not because -- </p><p> RYAN:  It's a complete reversal.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  -- there are so many times that we have brought good-solid  ideas to the table.  There are times, remember when -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows Harry Reid got in the middle of everything and  stopped any legislation.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's right, 400 bills.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows that.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  And what we are saying is, come on, guys, there're things that  are on the table.  We need to get these done.  Let's get them to the  President's desk.</p><p> It is time to get this country moving again.  The American people voted for  us.  That is s why Donald Trump is president.  So let's bring our best  efforts to bear.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The people want you guys to work together.  You know that.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes, they do.</p><p> RYAN:  You're the President, you set the tone.  Pick the issues that you  know are going to unify the country.  Pick the transportation bill,  trillion dollars, Davis-Bacon, broadband in every corner of the country.   We want to see -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And military spending -- it looks like the public wants an  increase in military spending.  That's according to the polls.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, we do.  We do -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> RYAN:  Let's do it, Marcia -- you and I should do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.</p><p> RYAN:  But I think we do need to rebuild the military. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Ryan and Congresswoman Blackburn -- thank you.</p><p> We will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We are live from our nation's capital for President Trump's  address to a joint session of Congress tonight.</p><p> It is a gorgeous sunrise behind me.  Take a look.  We are enjoying this  beautiful day here in Washington.</p><p> Meanwhile a top executive of Uber who recently joined the company from  Google has resigned. </p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and back story there.  Cheryl -- over to  you.</p><p> CASONE:  I've got the story, not the sunrise though here in New York City  like you've got, Maria.</p><p> So Amit Singhal resigned from Uber for not disclosing a sexual harassment  charge at his former employer that was first reported by Recode.  Singhal  denies he sexually harassed anyone while he was at Google where he was the  head of Search.  Uber has been dealing with charges of discriminatory and  sexist behavior at their company.  Singhal joined Uber in January from  Google and his senior (ph) role in maps and to advise on Uber's self- driving technology.</p><p> Well, speaking of self-driving Uber cars, the \"New York Times\" reporting  those cars missed at least six red lights and that had nothing to do with  human error, as Uber first said they did.  Problems with the mapping  program is to blame on that incident.</p><p> Well, careful what you say around your kids toys.  Hackers recently exposed  the conversations of nearly a million owners of Cloud Pets.  They make  those stuffed cats, dogs or rabbits for kids that you can use to talk to  your kids with.  Well, the animals are supposed to deliver messages that  you record via an app on your phone.  Well many of those recording ended up  in the hands of hackers as did passwords and e-mails.  Security experts say  it's warning the parents that have these pets to be aware of what they're  giving their children especially if they are using Cloud Pets, by the way.</p><p> Well, SpaceX wants to send humans into deep space; the company owned by  Elon Musk already delivers cargo to the space station for NASA.  Now they  hope to begin taking tourists around the moon within two years.  SpaceX  says it has already accepted a significant deposit from two unidentified  private citizens who want to fly around the moon.  The tourist flight would  last about a week and this would come after SpaceX begins (inaudible)  taking NASA astronauts up to the International Space Station and back.</p><p> Hope they enjoy that trip.  I will be watching from the ground -- Maria.   And those are your headlines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much-- Cheryl.  </p><p> President Trump meeting with lawmakers and business leaders to jumpstart  his number one priority, the task of repealing and replacing Obamacare.   We'll take a look at that.</p><p> Plus what else is on the President's agenda for tonight's big speech.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, you are the big ones.   You are the biggest of the big -- right.  That's very impressive.  Thank  you for being here.</p><p> We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that  Obamacare has had and we are going the change it and straighten it out.   And we have a plan that's going to be, I think, fantastic.  It'll be  released fairly soon.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking during a meeting yesterday  with the CEO's of the country's largest health insurance.</p><p> Joining us right now is the former chief of staff under Bush 43 and the  president and CEO of the Business Roundtable -- Josh Bolten joining us now.   Josh -- good to see you.</p><p> JOSH BOLTEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> First off, give us your expectations for the big speech tonight.  What  should President Trump be thinking in terms of what's most important as you  have seen this before being the chief of staff?  What do you think he's  going to be front and center and where he should focus?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Well, every state of the union or this is a quasi-state of the  union should give the President an opportunity to set priorities.  From the  standpoint of the business community and from the standpoint of the whole  U.S. economy, the most important thing the President can do is really get  the ball rolling on three key priorities -- tax reform, regulatory reform,  and investment in infrastructure.</p><p> There's a tremendous opportunity sitting right there for the Republican  Congress for the President.  This is the time to really get the momentum  going for those priorities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I agree with you.  Are you comfortable with the timing  that the President has laid out because so far we are looking at tax reform  now really having a bigger impact in 2018 as opposed to this year?</p><p> We had Steven Mnuchin on this program yesterday who was very clear that we  are not going see a real plan probably until the summer time, August.  </p><p> BOLTEN:  You know, we would like to see it move as fast as possible.   Secretary Mnuchin is right that it's going to be hard to have a plan  actually implemented before 2018.  But the whole business community would  like to see tax reform done as rapidly as possible in 2017.  But they've  got a lot on their plate.  They need to work it through</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What kind of an impact do you expect tax reform to have on  economic growth?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  If it's a good tax reform and by good I mean a tax reform that  substantially lowers corporate rates to an internationally competitive  level and a tax reform that shifts us toward a territorial system of  taxation.  If it's that kind of tax reform, it'll have a huge impact on the  economy.  It's an enormous opportunity because we have kept our economy  shackled by a way outdated tax system.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not only that but shackled by an enormous amount of regulation.   So you've got this rollback of regulation happening alongside the tax  reform.  How important is that?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Huge also.  That portion is already under way.  The administration  has taken some really important steps both in terms of process and  addressing specific regulations that are tying up business unnecessarily.</p><p> We can protect our health, our safety, our environment without  unnecessarily making it so difficult for the businesses in America to  create jobs and they are on the way to doing that although that'll be  rolling out over the course of the year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Josh -- let me ask you.  And I want to ask you about your  Business Roundtable new job as well -- congratulations on that.  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me take you back to when you were the chief of staff, what  do you recommend the President do if he gets interrupted tonight?  If there  are people who are protesting -- we know that Rosie O'Donnell is expected  to be outside leading a protest.  We know that a lot of Democrats are  taking guests who are immigrants or trying to make a point of the  diversified country that we love.  What should President Trump do in that  regard?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Rise above.  This is the moment to be presidential.  Campaign is  over, now the country wants to come together behind one president.</p><p> You know, I think the vast majority of the country, whether they voted for  President Trump or not, want to see him succeed and now is his opportunity  to be really presidential and lead the country towards some of the  priorities that I just mentioned.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  As you take on this new role what's your priority at the  Business Roundtable?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Tax, that is huge for the companies that are members of the BRT.   We have 200 CEOs who participate in it.  They represent some of the biggest  companies in the United States, employ 15 million people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are they happy with President Trump?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  You know, they are very excited about the opportunity that his  changes in policies might pose -- the tax reform, the regulation, the  infrastructure.  That's why you see so much bounce in the stock market and  you feel it among the members of the BRT as well.  They think there's a  great opportunity here and tonight is the opportunity for the President to  really get that ball rolling.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Josh -- we'll be watching  what you do as well at the Business Roundtable.  Thank you.</p><p> BOLTEN:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Josh Bolten joining us there.</p><p> We've got more ahead.  The President's plan to strengthen the military.   Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin joins me next live right here.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with special coverage of  President Trump's address to the joint of congress, live from Washington  D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're happy you're with us this morning.  We're  coming to you live from Washington D.C. I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Tuesday February 28th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p> President Trump will address a joint session of congress for the first time  as our commander-in-chief.  Among the issues tonight to be discussed,  defense.  The president expected to call for a massive increase in spending  to defend our country.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget.   Very much based on those two and plenty of other things but very strong.   It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the  depleted military of the United States of America.</p><p> We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's address tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern, so stay with us right  here as we have full analysis and live coverage tonight.</p><p> Will President Trump look to the past for inspiration?  We will bring you  some of the top moments from previous president's first addresses to  congress.</p><p> Coming up this morning.  One stop to watch, today target shares are  plummeting in the free market.  The retailer missed expectations when a  reported revenue and earnings this morning.  The stock is down almost 13  percent.  We are breaking down the numbers to give you backstory on target.</p><p> And it could be a record day on Wall Street nonetheless.  Take a look at  markets here, really trading right around the flat line.  A gain today  would be a 13th record close in the row for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.</p><p> In Europe meanwhile, stocks are searching for direction.  Take a look at  the European indices and you will see most of the average is lower but just  by a fraction.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Take a look at Asian markets  where the Hong Kong Hang Seng index was the loser down three quarters of  one percent.</p><p> The headache continues this morning for Samsung.  The details as the heir  to the brand is indicted on bribery charges.</p><p> And move over TV.  The massive amount of video we are all watching on  YouTube could lead traditional in the dust.  We'll tell you about the  amazing amount of video people are watching.</p><p> Talk about a seal of approval.  The adorable hug that's going viral this  morning.  We'll bring you that.</p><p> But first, our top story this half hour keeping America safe.  President  Donald Trump will seek an additional $54 billion in spending for the  Department of Defense tonight when he makes his speech in front of  congress.</p><p> Yesterday, the commander-in-chief hinted at his plans for the military  budget before he addresses the joint session of congress tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild  the depleted military of the United States of America at a time when most  needed.</p><p> We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We want to bring in Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.   And secretary Shulkin, it is great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p> DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  Thank you.  It's great to be  here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  You have so many accolades to discuss.  You're the  sole Obama appointee in this administration.  You were confirmed  unanimously.  People were saying, oh, this is an easy one.  You have been  at the Veterans Affairs, even though the president have said how bad the VA  has been.</p><p> He kept somebody who was there at the VA.  So you've got a great legacy as  you come into this job.  What do you expect to hear from the president  tonight?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, what I'd expect to hear is the strong support for making  sure that we're caring for our men and women who have served our country.   There's a commitment there and that hundred to zero both from the U.S.  congress is not so much about me.  It's really the country's commitment to  making sure that we do everything that we can to deliver on our promise to  our veterans.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me one of the biggest issues and how do you fix it and  that is restoring trust and accountability at the VA.  What is your  solution to those?</p><p> SHULKIN:  I think we all know that in the wait time crisis in April 2014,  we did let the country down.  We did let our veterans down.  And it's much  easier to lose trust and it is to gain it back.  </p><p> So we are slowly gaining that trust back and we're seeing that happen as we  really begin to deliver and transform the VA to be a system that we're all  proud of once again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?  Why with those wait times such a problem?  How did that  happen?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think that it was really two things.  One is it was our  lack of willingness to ask for the resources that we needed to care for our  country's veterans and we just fell behind.</p><p> Secondly, it was a culture in the VA of not willing to come forward and  talk about what was really happening to hide those long wait times.</p><p> Frankly, no system is going to be able to regain trust if it isn't  transparent and if it isn't accountable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have said in the past, look, if a veteran wants to go to a  private medical provider, then do it.  People saw that in, wait a second,  is he for privatization?  Is he going to change something?  What's your  stance on that?</p><p> SHULKIN:  I came from the private sector.  So when I entered the Veterans  Affairs, I was hoping to trying to see whether it made sense to privatize  the VA.  And I quickly learned that the VA is a unique national resource,  that we can't simply just let veterans get all their care in the private  sector, but they'd be losing a lot of very valuable services that are  important to care for men and women.</p><p> So I believe the solution is an integration of what's really great and best  about the VA as well as what's better and best about the private sector.</p><p> Our servicemen and women deserve the very best to what about both these  systems can give them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because you're from the private sector, you have an opinion on  private sector people running agencies.  What do you think about the fact  the president has surrounded himself with business people?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think what we need in government is more best practices  of businesses.  I think we need to take what's working in the private  sector and make sure that government can function that way.</p><p> And when government gets bloated, full regulations on red tape, it doesn't  serve people well.  So I think having this private sector people in the  government makes a lot of sense.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got this new Fox News poll out and it shows that voters  more faith in the military compared to other national institutions.   Ninety-six of those surveyed said that they have a great deal or some  confidence in the military.</p><p> Secretary Shulkin, last week you reportedly promised major changes.  We're  coming to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  What can our servicemen and  women expect?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, first of all, that poll makes sense to me.  When I have the  privilege of spending time with our men and women in uniform, you can't  help but feel proud.  These are courageous patriotic Americans that really  should give confidence in the country and I feel confident with them.</p><p> I think the changes that we need or to make VA accountable to essentially  be open and transparent about what's going on and to give more choice so  that people can get the very best of care wherever they need to get it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are expecting the president tonight to propose $54 billion  increase spending on the military.  How do you feel about that?  Where do  you think the money ought to go?  Because when we talk about the military  right now, when we speak to veterans, they all tell us they need more  resources.</p><p> SHULKIN:  Yes, what I know from history and I know the president  appreciates this.  When we make a decision to send our men and women off to  protect us and to fight for our country, that's a lifetime commitment.</p><p> And so when you create the spending at the very beginning of the defense  department, you need to have that commitment all the way through for  veterans.  Because we are committed to our veterans for life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you identify areas that you believe are absolutely needed  in terms of extra spend?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, we have projections that show what the need is going to be.   We know that our men and women coming back from almost recent conflicts or  coming back with not only physical injuries but also the invisible injuries  of war.  And sometimes, it takes additional resources to be able to make  sure that we're treating those invisible wounds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  And that's something that I think the  president that actually has mentioned as well.</p><p> How do you convince someone who's watching you now the leader at the VA but  you're an insider and someone who says look, this is broken.  We need an  outsider to come in and fix it.  How do you convince them that no, no, no.   You know this and that's why you are the best man to lead this?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, it's not my job to convince people.  I want people to watch  our results.  We are committed to fixing this.  We know we have to do  better and we are going to do better.</p><p> I've been in government now about 18 months.  That's long enough to  understand how the system and where the problems are.  And my discussions  with the president have been that we have to make these changes quickly and  being able to know where the problems are is going to allow us to do that  as quick as we need to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, President Bush visited MacDill Air Force base in  Florida yesterday.  He signed copies of his new book honoring veterans.   Last night, the former commander-in-chief sat down for an interview with  Sean Hannity and talked about his interactions with military families.   Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm kind of a crier.  When a mom hugs  me and talks about her son, it affected me.  On the other hand, it is hard  for many people to understand.  But when you go to Walter Reed and a  soldier looks at you who's lost his legs, I'd do it again.</p><p> Or you're riding mountain bikes with these troops, some of them lost a leg  who went back into combat.  Or a mother whose son lost her life and said, I  just want you to know my son died doing what he wanted to do.  It lifts  your spirit.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Secretary.</p><p> SHULKIN: Well, I recently had a chance to visit with President Bush at his  library in Dallas.  And I have a great deal of respect.  I think that the  president like many of us after he spent time with the men and women that  serve our country, it impacts you.  And he truly feels the commitment to  these men and women.</p><p> And his book his paintings and his life commitment now to those men and  women now to those men and women is really inspiring to me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you look at today's military, the modern military versus  what we saw just 10 years ago, how do you make a distinction?   What's  different today and what are the new realities that required a different  take?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think the big difference is that so many people that are  injured on the battlefield now survive.  And years ago these would have  been injuries that would've killed them.  So we're seeing people come back  with absolutely devastating and complex types of injuries that now we are  responsible for making sure that we provide them with the best care.</p><p> And that complexity has really changed the VA because we need to respond to  those injuries.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you respond effectively?  Is it a money issue?  What is  it that you need in terms of new tools?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think it's in part a money issue, but that really isn't  the big problem.  Fortunately, this president has made the commitment to  support our veterans with the resources we need.</p><p> We also have to be changing.  We have to be looking for new and better ways  to ensure that we are managing and treating the conditions that are coming  back.  This is new territory and that's why VA, not only provides care but  does research.  Our research which is the largest dedicated to veterans is  helping us improve our care every day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So when you hear the conversation taking place right now for  example about ObamaCare, what's your takeaway there knowing what you've  seen at the VA in terms of health care?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think that what we know about the VA is providing a  comprehensive system of care that is providing not only physical treatment  but the psychological, social, economic treatment really is what people  need to have well-being in their life.  And I think this comprehensive  system of care has really been impactful and important for our country's  veterans.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you looking toward anything specific that you'd like to  hear from the president tonight in that regard?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I speak to the president.  The president is absolutely  committed not only to a strong country and to a security, but also to  making sure that we honor our commitment.  When we asked people to serve  their country, but that is the lifetime commitment.  That the country's  prepared to follow through on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p> SHULKIN:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate your time.  Secretary David Shulkin there.  Fox  Business Network is taking you live to the president's address tonight to a  joint session of congress.</p><p> It kicks off at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.  We've got analysis throughout the  program.  And \"Mornings with Maria\" will be live tomorrow morning right  here in Washington D.C. for in-depth analysis after we hear the president's  address tonight.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  We're live from Washington and we'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The vice chairman of Samsung, four other  officials being indicted.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl,  over to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The prosecutors in South  Korea have announced the indictment of Samsung heir and vice chairman Lee  Jae-yong and the other officials.  That happened earlier today.  He was  arrested February 17th and a move that polarized that country.  Lee's  accused of being deeply involved in a corruption scandal that led to the  impeachment of South Korea's president.  He is now charged with bribery,  embezzlement, perjury, hiding assets abroad and concealing profit gained  from criminal acts.</p><p> Another headlines this morning, YouTube users around the world are now  watching more than one billion hours of video a day.  Experts say the  number keeps going up as Google's artificial intelligence continues to  produce as recommended videos to users.</p><p> And YouTube is now threatening traditional television.  Nielsen data shows  Americans watch an average of 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV  shows a day.  Numbers are getting very close.</p><p> And finally this, Maria, I dare you to find a cuter picture than this one.   A feel in a Japanese who was given a plush toy seal by zoo staff.  He  simply just fell in love with the toy.  He hugs the toy.  He puts the toy  on his back for a ride.  These pictures have obviously gone viral.  The  internet is in love as well.  And this probably going to all end up on a  lot of phones.</p><p> And you know what Maria, those are the big stories from New York City.  I  give you the seal.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is so cute, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> Coming up, a presidential walk down memory lane.  How President Trump's  tonight to a joint session of congress will compare to his predecessors  over the years.  That's next, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump making his first address to  congress tonight and history shows the speech could have a lasting impact.</p><p> Joining us right now is presidential historian, author of a New Book, \"Game  of Thorns,\" Doug Wead is with us.  And, Doug, it's good to have you on the  program.</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> How do you think the president speech will compare to those before him?</p><p> WEAD:  I think he's going to be very different.  I think he will be on  message.  So he's going to talk about the economy and make America great  and he's probably going to go what his critics will say, and his close  friends will say some as off message.</p><p> He'll probably say some a little bizarre thing.  But I've learned in  researching \"Game of Thorns,\" when he's off message, he's on message.   There's two message.  One is restore America, make it great again.  And the  second message is I no politician.  So when he deviates, he's still on  message.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then he always adlibs.  Sometimes it gets him in trouble.   But he does always adlibs.  So one of the most emotional addresses over the  years was from Lyndon Johnson.  Sworn in just days after the assassination  of John F. Kennedy.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LYNDON JOHNSON 36TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  All I have that I would have given  gladly not to be standing here today.  No words are sad enough to express  our sense of loss.  No words are strong enough to express our  determination, to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obviously, this was an emotional moment in time.  But explain  the emotional impact that this had on the country.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, this was a very tough time for the country, a hurtful time for  the country.  And for Lyndon Johnson personally.  This was a devastating  moment.  He was a great man.  He was a powerful man, that dominating force  in Washington but he was now destined forever to live in the shadow of John  F. Kennedy.  This young upstart who took power.  </p><p> So personally, this was a frustrating moment for Lyndon Johnson.  But he  knew the role he was destined to play by history and he had to play it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, we're expecting to hear a lot about the economy tonight,  tax reform, rollback of regulation.  That was something President Reagan  brought up during his address.  Let's take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RONALD RAEGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  Almost eight million Americans are out  of work.  These are people who want to be productive.  The threat of  layoffs and unemployment hangover other millions and all who work are  frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.  We must begin  now.  But people are watching and waiting.  They don't demand miracles.   They do expect us to act.  Let us act together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Act together.  Your thoughts.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes.  Reagan gave one of the few joint speeches to the joint  sessions where he actually did what he said he was going to do and I expect  Donald Trump to be that kind of president.  Most of these speeches when you  study them, they'll give the speech and they do the exact opposite.  It's  uncanny.</p><p> But in this case, I think Trump like Reagan is going to do what he's  telegraphing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can he balance, guys, this presidential demeanor, but also be  Donald Trump?</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I wanted to call out if any of the  democrats have called him or boo him.  I wanted to point to them and call  them out by name and say, who are you booing?  And then call them all their  nonsense, I would actually love to see that.  It's not presidential, but it  could be Trumpian.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I'd like to see him say, OK, congressmen, such and such,  you're with illegal immigrant that's done terrific things in this country.   That's exactly the kind of immigrants we want.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I'm looking at is other undertones of Andrew  Jackson.  This is what we got in the inaugural.  Steve Bannon gave -- it  was very involved in this speech.  It had a lot of America first  nationalist undertones that hearken back to Andrew Jackson.</p><p> Do you think we're going to see that in this feature?  Or are we going to  see a different kind of president?</p><p> WEAD:  Well, we're seeing it in his handling of the media because Andrew  Jackson was devastated by what the media did to his wife that killed his  wife and he hated the media, organized his own network of newspapers to  oppose them.</p><p> In \"Game of Thorns,\" I get into the media problems that Donald Trump has  and it's staggering.  The left and the right are opposed to this guy.  Much  of it has to do about China.  And I have to say this.  My name is on the  book, but the people who really gave the information to me from the book or  sources who risk their jobs, they were with Hillary Clinton for 10, 15, 20  years.  And there's some people in China who risk their lives to give this  information about the Chinese flow of money to the Clintons.  So it's a  serious issue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is a serious issue.  And the book is \"Game of Thorns.\"  And  we expect it's going to be a big seller.  Thank you so much Doug Wead.   We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Tying the record set 30 years ago, a gain on today would be 13 record  closes in a row which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.

The Wall  Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  And We'll be  joined by Rachel Campos-Duffy shortly.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  Great setting.  Once again, back in  Washington as we preview the president's plans tonight.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.  Big increases in defense  spending, big increases in infrastructure spending, and it sounds like he's  directing his agencies to cutback spending in places like the EPA and the  state department.  All the money that's been going overseas, he wants to  keep it at home, America first, that's his message.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But also, what does he say about the repeal and replace of  ObamaCare because, again, he conceded yesterday that the health law is  unbelievably complex according to President Trump and then also tax reform.  </p><p> I've got a little -- there's a line at the bottom of an article in the New  York Times today that might give investors pause.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  On the tax reform package.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On the tax reform package.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We got a lot to talk about on that, that is a big story, you're  so right.  We're going to continue that this morning.</p><p> And joining us this morning and joining the conversation, Veterans Affair  Secretary, David Shulkin, this is his second secretary from the president's  cabinet to speak out.  We, of course, heard from the Treasury Secretary  yesterday, Steen Mnuchin.  And this morning, we hear from VA Secretary,  David Shulkin right here with us.  Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us.  And Tennessee  Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn will join us.  Plus, Ohio Congressman, Tim  Ryan is going to walk through the democrat's plan.  And Former Chief of  Staff under Bush 43 and Business Rountable President and CEO, Josh Bolton,  that's a new role for Josh Bolten, I'm going to talk with him about it.</p><p> Big show ahead, so stay right there and do stay with us as we kick it off  right now with our story.  President Trump is set to outline his agenda on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  At the  address, with joint session of congress tonight.  (inaudible) with details  right now, all the specifics at the White House.  Peter, good morning to  you.</p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Maria.  That's right,  we're getting more details on the president's speech tonight from some of  his top aides.</p><p> And as you mentioned, he will discuss a number of initiatives including  healthcare reform, infrastructure, border security and other issues.  He'll  also review the accomplishments of his first month, in particular those  executive orders and his Supreme Court nominee.  The president sat down  with Fox &amp; Friends to give us a preview of his remarks, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from the heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming out.  We have to  understand, ObamaCare has been a disaster, it's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border.</p><p> And remember this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting  the bad ones out, the bad people, gang members, drug lords, in some cases,  murders.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES:  Now we expect tonight that his most concrete largest initiative  will be his announcement, his call for another $54 billion in defense  spending, he will ask congress for that, a 10 percent increase his aide  say.</p><p> An administration official said however that the broad theme of the speech  will be the renewal of America and the optimistic vision for all Americans,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  And, of course, we're all  focused on where the spending is going to be.  Peter Barnes, thank you at  the White House this morning.  Rachel Campos-Duffy with us this morning,  and Rachel, a Senior White House Official describing President Trump's  speech tonight as a renewal of the American spirit.</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's a great way to  describe it, everything.</p><p> This guy's going to have an audience like nobody's business tonight.  I  mean he's a showman, the inauguration was a big speech but that was at  12:00 in the afternoon, this is primetime, people want to see what he's  going to say and the democrats are making a little bit interesting with  their bringing in guests or they're going to mix it up.</p><p> I hear Meryl Streep might come, I heard she was invited, they're bringing  dreamers and all kinds of people to mix it up and I think he's got a real  opportunity to give an optimistic message and a brand new start.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's funny that they say Meryl Streep is going to attend  because the word was Rosie O'Donnell was going to be protesting outside  actually.  So that will be exciting.</p><p> But in terms of the audience, Dagen, what's your take on this because a lot  of the democrats are saying, \"Look, we want to bring someone who came here  as an immigrant, is now an American citizen but has contributed to our  country in a good way\" as a message to the president.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And what message are they trying to send?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because, again --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're so right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- we make the distinction between illegal immigrants that he  addresses that so many people in this country think that illegal  immigration is a problem, we're not talking about legal immigrants who have  come to this country whether it is through visas and through -- and have  gotten green cards, that's not the message.</p><p> And by the way, in his move to stop illegal immigration, he said we're not  going to touch dreamers or children who are here under the deferred action  on children under President Obama, that's number one.  And at least the  democrats are showing up which remember the dozens who do not show up to  the inauguration at least will be there.  I dare them to boo, I dare them  to boo.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  That will happen.  That will happen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Shame on them.</p><p> HILSENRANTH:  When you talk about democrats, one of the important things we  have to think about is the president announces his plans for spending.   He's going to need some democratic support, he needs 60 votes to pass his  appropriations measures.</p><p> So he's got to find some ways to reach out at the -- if he wants to  increase military spending, wants to increase infrastructure spending and  cutback all these agencies, he's got to get some democrats on board.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out, he needs the democrats for the  replacement in ObamaCare in the senate as well.  If the repeal is easy  under the -- you can just -- you get a simple majority on the  reconciliation but it's the replacement and that becomes a huge hurdle in  the next year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And by the way, that is why they did ObamaCare first because  they didn't want to have to deal with needing the extra votes for tax  reform.  They do that during the budget reconciliation and they feel that  it's an easier path to get that done, that's why ObamaCare's first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You want to know the line that investors should pay attention  to?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's in the New York Times, it is the last paragraph with an  article about the healthcare law and it mentions that as Steve Mnuchin the  Treasury Secretary told you that they want tax reform, tax cuts for both  businesses and middle class Americans by in time with the August recess.</p><p> The last line says, \"Since healthcare must be addressed first, tax  legislation could easily be pushed into 2018 according to members of  congress and administration officials.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's critical.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Even Mnuchin has said that August is ambitious.  So when he  sat down with us he acknowledge that it might go a little bit later.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But they still have October -- they still have the fall to  finish some of this stuff, I think that's (inaudible).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think the expectation based on this market run up, some of it  is just fundamental but the expectation is to gets done in this year and  not 2018.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have you tried to take those expectations down little by  little?  There's a real nuance in terms of the way they're speaking all the  officials about this?</p><p> But look, Steven Mnuchin said very clearly that the real impact is going to  be in 2018 and I think that -- and you know really took our expectations  down first.  When we were hearing in Washington, remember Ted Cruz?   Remember Ted Cruz was the first person to say and we felt, \"Wait a minute,  we thought we were going to get tax reform right away\" but ever since then  they've been taking these expectations down.</p><p> So let's talk about the budget for a second because we're looking for a $20  billion boost in military spending, the president has also hinted at more  infrastructure spending during a meeting with governors, he said this  yesterday at the White House, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're going to make it easier for the states to invest in  infrastructure and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on  infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East and we have  potholes all over our highways and our roads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On that note, infrastructure stocks fight on Wall Street after  the commander-in-chief's announcement, let's take a look.  This is one of  the areas Jon Hilsenrath that has been leading this rally, the  infrastructure, construction aides.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  And this is an area where he might actually be able to  get some democratic buy-in because you want people on both sides, in fact,  the Obama Administration wanted the infrastructure spending too.</p><p> So -- and I think the other reason we saw infrastructure stocks reacting  yesterday is we haven't heard a lot about that, there's been a lot of talk  about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, a lot of talk about military  spending and tax cuts, we haven't heard so much about the infrastructure  piece of this and how they're going to fund it.  So the fact that he's  brining that back up again makes you think, \"All right, maybe it is on the  agenda.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And on the military spending side, his proposed increase in  defense spending $54 billion, 10 percent increase, it's only $18.5 billion  above levels proposed by President Obama and it's short of what the likes  of Senator John McCain want.  </p><p> The Trump Administration is talking about a little over $600 billion,  McCain wants $640 billion.  So it's even -- so when you talk about  additional spending, they could go further.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I mean, the big question for me is how do you pay for this  stuff?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It's easy to convince people to spend more money up here on  Capitol Hill but how is he going to be able to get the cuts in all these  other programs to -- that pays for it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And no -- questioning no changes to Medicare and Social  Security.  Those are the big kind of tsunamis waiting for the Americans.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The obvious answer is bigger deficits.  But as he has said so  many times including this campaign, $20 trillion debt, how do you do all  this with $20 trillion?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're going to put the debt over the long-term and they're  going to look at it over the long-term and not look at that as a near-term  priority, obviously.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  They're going to allow --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got a lot of plans, they have to do that.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  And I think they're going to think they can grow out  of this as well.  I mean you're seeing the (inaudible) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't grow out of Medicare and Social Security.  You can't  grow out of the entitlement.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  No, not of Social Security, not over the entitlement but as  far as paying and also we've seen him take airplanes that costs billions of  dollars and not millions of dollars off the price.</p><p> So people are expecting him to do that and look, he's a builder.  People  want him to build and unlike the stimulus where -- I don't know what came  out of that, I can't find a road that was built from that and all the  (inaudible) jobs, this somebody who said he's going to build people's trust  that he once built, he wants to do this, he's let congress know this was a  huge priority for him and people trust him with this part of building, they  like him.  So they think he's the one to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep navigating what we're expecting tonight.   And Fox Business Network is taking you live to the president's address  tonight as he addresses a joint session of congress tonight at 9:00pm  Eastern.</p><p> Mornings with Maria will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. for  in-depth analysis as well.

Fire official say one of the teenagers was thrown from a  backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl had only minor injuries.  The  pilot also survived this crash we should say.</p><p> Well in other news, Japanese auto parts maker, Takata is now pleading  guilty of fraud and agreeing to pay a billion dollars for concealing a  defect in millions of its airbags.  The defect has been blamed for at least  11 deaths in the U.S. alone and more than a 180 injuries worldwide.  And,  of course, the biggest recall in American auto history involving 42 million  cars and as to 69 million airbags.</p><p> Well, as investors await President Trump's address to congress tonight,  they're going to be watching earnings from Target before the bell this  morning.

Ahead of the big debut, the company says it expects investors  who buy as much as a quarter of the shares to agree not to sell them for a  year.

Snap targeting evaluation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion  and, again, that stock is going to be listed on the New York Stock  Exchange, the ticker will be snap.</p><p> And those are your headlines from New York, Maria back to you at  Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thanks so much.

Well into the battle of the presidents now,  President Trump is blaming President Obama for the country's lack of unity,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it.  I also think it's politics, that's  the way it is.  And look, I have a very different understanding --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Bush wasn't going after Clinton, Clinton was going  after Bush.</p><p> TRUMP:  Well you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes.   You know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  I  think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly  behind it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us here on set.   Mark, what do you make of this?</p><p> MARK PENN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR HILLARY CLINTON:  Well I think it's so  unfortunate because I think today really Trump have to reach out to the  other side.  I mean I think that's the critical opportunity he's got with  his speech today, why throw Obama, at Obama, why divided up this early in  the morning.  Big mistake in my view.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well look, I definitely agree that there's no room for sort of  pointing fingers when we have all the big issues at hand that the president  and everyone else is trying to do but I want to be clear, in President  Obama's last speech to the country, he did say organized a few times.</p><p> If you don't like what's going on, get up and make some noise.  I mean he  did say things like that in that last speech, didn't he?</p><p> PENN:  Yes.  But look, the president's got to get democrats and republicans  applauding tonight.  If this gets so rough during the day and Obama comes  out, democrats will start boycotting, he'll get the opposite of what he was  looking for.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you've done this so many times, you have supervised six  speeches, presidential speeches.  When you say he's got to get everybody  applauding, talk about that.  How important is that and why is that so  important to get the whole room buying in right away?</p><p> PENN:  Look, the reaction of the room and the willingness of everyone to  applaud him at anything, right, is gold for him.</p><p> I remember in 1998, we didn't know whether or not the country is going to  impeach President Clinton until they stood up and applauded.  He has a  similar moment, right?  The democrats have never applauded him, he's got to  start out I think with something like the military and honoring the  military so that he gets everybody applauding and in that mode because  remember, he'll talk about infrastructure and some people will applaud,  he'll talk about taxes, he'll talk about immigration and a lot will sit on  their hands.  He needs a key moment of unity to make the speech successful  because that's what people are looking for at home.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think he's looking at it that way though?  I mean he's  so unconventional, his inaugural speech was not what most people expected,  very America first.  I mean he could come at this from a completely  different angle, didn't he?</p><p> PENN:  He could.  And I think if it gets raucous, remember, I conducted a  Harvard-Harris Poll last week, 73 percent want democrats to work with  republicans and 68 percent want Trump to work with the democrats.  So he  doesn't show that tonight then his ratings are going to start to really go  down here because they want that done.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But could it be also that if the democrats behave so badly  that it ends up just making them look bad and so maybe he doesn't feel like  he has to try to win them over rather than talk about the military you  said.  </p><p> And the more they misbehave, the more of them that gave their tickets to  code pink to interrupt and really sort of hashtag resist that it's going to  make the dems look back.</p><p> PENN:  Well, what we've seen for the first time is the republicans have a  slightly higher image in the Wall Street Journal poll than democrats.  So I  don't think the resistance strategy has been working.  So I think tonight,  the democrats will do better if they can show some unity around some key  issues and resistance around others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I think you make a great point and this weekend on  Sunday Morning Futures, I interviewed Congressman Langevin who is bringing  with him tonight a Pakistani born doctor who is here in America, he's a  Muslim-American by the way.</p><p> He's legally here, he's done great things for this country in terms of his  work but I kept pushing back at him saying, look, there's a different  between legal and illegal, why are you grandstanding?  Why bring the guest  anyway?  Why not just go to the speech, sleeves rolled up, ready to work  and get the people's business done?  And so that's the issue, why the  grandstanding?  Just let's get to work.</p><p> PENN:  Well the balcony traditionally has been used in these speeches.   Usually the president's balcony is the most important thing that he can add  to his speech.  The democrats are doing it in reverse, they're saying,  \"Hey, what about the guys whose he's excluding?  What about the people here  who may be here illegally but are operating legally and following our laws?   What's going to them?\"  </p><p> And I think it's fair that they raise that issue but remember, look, the  business community wants to hear about infrastructure and tax cuts, they've  been waiting, if they don't hear that, there's going to be some I think  serious negative consequences.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  There have been a slew of holes out over the last few days  including the Wall Street Journal's polls which showed that the public is  for the president's policies, they have some questions about the way he's  behaving, what jumped out at you from these polls?  What did you learn  about his first couple of months in office and how the public is receiving  it?</p><p> PENN:  Well he doesn't have honeymoon ratings, on the other hand, his  ratings are no lower than Obama's or Clinton's or Bush's were during most  of the presidency.  He's in the high 40s I think in most of the polls.  </p><p> My poll came out at 48 percent job approval, he hasn't reached over to the  rest of the country but he's got a strong base, people support a good  measure of his policies, they think he will bring change in the Wall Street  Journal poll.  So he's got a lot of things working for him but the division  that he's creating, comments like the Obama thing really are creating this  division that is holding him back from being president of everybody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you really think that there isn't a group of Obama  loyalists that may very well be behind the protesters?</p><p> PENN:  I think the protesters is genuine because --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you say that's not real really?</p><p> PENN:  Because remember, Trump is in fact following the strategy of  dividing the country in his speeches.  Dividing the country with comments  like that.  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well President Obama did that (inaudible) he's pointing a lot  it's the republican's fault on every turn.  Come on.</p><p> PENN:  Look, for every action there's a reaction in politics.  So I think  the protests are real, I think the sentiment he stirred up are real.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And he's the first act community organizer president and  it's very clear that they are -- I just went to a town hall with my husband  yesterday and it was very well -- they have a pamphlet, they have a  strategy, they organized ahead of time, they eat an hour before the town  hall starts.</p><p> I mean, there's an organization behind it and that's fine, people should  come and talk to their congressmen but it's really unseemly I think to have  an ex-president really putting his weight behind that in that way.  I think  it's divisive.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We don't know exactly what the president is doing obviously,  President Obama.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's only a mile from the Capitol.  He's living just right  here for a reason.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  This group organizing for action, we don't know how involved  the president is in direct to the activities.  But this group that was  associated with the Obama's campaign organizing for action, the word is  that they're involved in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we know that Soros is involved hugely in this step.  Before  we --  </p><p> PENN:  That there's real sentiment behind these protests.  You can't  organize people who don't care about things.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we go, I want to get your take on Tom Perez as the  Democratic National Committee chair.  What's your take?  </p><p> PENN:  Well, look, I -- I think -- I think that it's great that -- that he  won.  I think that Democrats and a -- a lot of Jewish supporters and donors  would have real problems had he not won.  </p><p> And I think it reaffirms.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, he put Keith Ellison as his deputy, though.  </p><p> PENN:  Well, but, you know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, that's -- that's the guy that a lot of moderates didn't  want.  </p><p> PENN:  But that at least shows, look, we've got to bring the party  together.  I think they came out of that pretty well because the scare was  that -- that, in fact, the party would take such a turn to the left.  </p><p> And the answer was it didn't.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, why do you -- why do you say Jewish donors would have.</p><p> PENN:  Well, I think -- I think -- I think there was a lot of concern about  Ellison.  Haim Saban (ph), for example, said he would not, you know, if I  remember it correctly, would -- would no longer support Democrats.  I (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because of his comments about Israel.  </p><p> PENN:  .well, because that's right.  And -- and so I think that would  really have stirred it up.  But -- but I do think they brought the party  together.  </p><p> They had to do that.  I think -- I think the Democrats are in better shape.   The question is, when are they going to get a strategy -- a legislative  strategy here that makes sense in response to -- to Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and in response to what the people want.  Let's face it.   It's -- it's really economic issues that the people are hoping that the  Democrats focus on.  </p><p> Mark, great insights from you as always.  </p><p> PENN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Penn joining us there.  we're going to  take a short break.  </p><p> When we come back, President Trump speaking to a joint session of Congress  tonight.  He's expecting to call for a substantial increase in military  spending -- what it means for your security.  </p><p> And then new drinks sprouting out (ph) at Starbucks -- the beverages coming  to the menu just in time for spring.  We'll be back in two minutes' time,  back in a moment (ph).  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks for  being with us.  </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  We are coming here from Washington.  It is Tuesday,  February 28.  Your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time as commander-in-chief.  The president is expected to stress  unity during the speech.  </p><p> However, before taking the stage, the president blamed his predecessor for  tensions in the country.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are  certainly behind it.  And some of the leaks possibly come from that group,  you know, some of the leaks which are really very serious leaks because  they're very bad in terms of national security.  </p><p> But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him being behind  things, that's politics.  </p><p> And it will probably continue.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network will bring you live coverage of the  president's address tonight.  That's at 9 p.m. Eastern.  </p><p> So stay with us on the Fox Business Network as we will have full analysis  and live coverage of that presidential address.  It could be another record  day in Wall Street.  </p><p> Futures are indicating the markets are flat right now.  But the lifting --  the Dow Industrial is up about 13 points.  </p><p> The Dow coming off of a record, 12th consecutive record high yesterday,  tying the record set 30 years ago.  Now, a gain today would be a 13th  record close in a row.  </p><p> That's never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.  And as you can see,  the markets are looking really fractionally moving. </p><p> But the Dow is, in fact, trading in all-time record territory.  Take a look  at European markets.  Stocks are searching for direction there with  fractional gain.  </p><p> And the DAX index is actually lower.  The others are fractionally higher.   Target revenue misses expectations.  </p><p> As you see there, we're watching earnings this morning.  And Target is  missing estimates on both earnings and revenue -- the numbers on the bottom  of your screen.  </p><p> We're going to take a look at the stock in a moment.  In Asia overnight,  meanwhile, markets were mixed.  </p><p> Take a look.  Shanghai and the Nikkei as well as the Kospi up, the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong down.  Well, at least 15 people injured in another crash  at Brazil's carnival celebration.  The details after a float collapses.  </p><p> Plus Warren Buffett taking a big bite out of Apple -- why the billionaire  investor is betting big on the technology giant.  And Starbucks is adding  to its menu -- how you can soon get your hands on the new iced drinks just  in time for spring, plus details on the company's new upscale roastery.  </p><p> Plus, Antonio Brown cashes in in the Steel City.  We are breaking down the  wide receiver's massive new contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </p><p> We want to hear about that.  First, our top story, though, this half hour.   Bolstering the nation's military -- that's a top priority for President  Trump.  </p><p> The White House says that the president's first budget proposal will  include a $54 billion increase in defense spending.  Military stocks like  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon rallied on the news.  </p><p> The move will likely garner plenty of public support.  The latest fox news  poll shows that 45 percent of Americans believe the country is spending too  little on military.  </p><p> Dagen is talking about this and looking at these proposals this morning.   What are your thoughts on this budget, Dagen? </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that it's a balancing act for  President Trump that he is -- he promised to increase spending on defense.   There's a 10 percent increase there, a little more than $400 billion, but  not at the levels (ph) that, say, a Senator John McCain has been calling  for. </p><p> And we should also point out that his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has - - That (ph) Senator McCain did not like him, doesn't really like him,  because he has been a deficit hawk.  And so, I think that you're getting --  you're getting something for people who want greater military spending,  greater defense spending, but also people who worry about a $20 trillion  debt.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, when you -- when you take a look.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  There's -- there's always the (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  .when you speak to military people, Jon, they always say that  we've got the oldest fleet in the Navy in -- in decades.  We're got the  oldest, you know, armament in the Army in decades.  I mean.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .we need upgrade, particularly as it relates to -- to  technology.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And as Dagen just pointed out, there's always  been this tension in the Republican Party, between the deficit hawks and  the military hawks.  And we see it between Mulvaney -- Mulvaney and McCain.  </p><p> And I think that's something that the president is going to have to wrestle  with over the next few months as he tries to take the ideas that he's going  to be talking about tonight and turn them into -- into actual policy.  </p><p> There is tension inside the Republican Party and within his plans between  controlling all of the debt, controlling the deficit and achieving all of  these goals if he wants to set out tax reform, military spending,  infrastructure spending, and most importantly, as -- as you said earlier,  there's going to be no -- no talk tonight about doing anything on Social  Security and Medicare.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  They were very clear about that.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  How do you make all of this fit together? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is -- which, to somebody worried about the debt and the  looming tsunami of -- so Medicare is going to go broke.  The hospital trust  fund goes broke 11 years from now.  </p><p> And we'll only be able to pay out 87 cents on the dollar in benefits.   Sixty-nine percent of our budget is mandatory spending on entitlements and  interest on the debt.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So more than two-thirds, they have no control over.  So when you  start talking about cutting the EPA, you're really just chipping away.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, agree (ph), I mean, that's the important point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's small potatoes, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  What he's going to be talking about tonight is cutting back on  the discretionary programs, a lot coming out of the State Department,  foreign aide, foreign diplomacy, America First.  But you -- you can't solve  these problems in the long run just by -- by cutting back discretionary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, when was the last time you heard a politician come out  and say, I promised you this and now, I'm taking it back?  I mean, the --  for those people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare and  Medicaid, they don't want those programs touched.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they were promised.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, the idea -- idea is you don't do it for.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they ever paid in.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .the idea is you don't it to -- you don't do it to people who  are getting it now.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But you tell people who are in their 30s.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .and 40s, you -- you might have to expect to work a little bit  longer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and most people understand that, right?  I mean, they  get that they -- that these programs are going broke.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They -- they like to know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So at some point.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .more (ph) because they think they're going to get nothing  as -- if the system goes bankrupt the way it is right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they -- but.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The younger people are not expecting.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They're not expecting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Younger people are not expecting.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  We talked to Jon two minutes (ph) ago, I'm not going to get  any (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  They -- that's what I'm saying.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, it's -- it's still a third rail because that no one in  this town can get it -- can get anything done on it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And the president himself doesn't, you know, he said he  campaigned.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even the most conservative people, when they close to retirement  age, they're like I'm getting mine.  I'm taking mine.  I have arguments  with my parents about this all the time.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  I paid in (ph).  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- I tell them -- they're saying (ph) -- well, I paid, and  I said but you're taking more than you paid in.  That's why it's going  broke.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And Mark Zuckerberg doesn't need it.  I mean, you know what  I'm saying?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  There's -- there's some ways that we can cut back on certain  incomes that people don't actually need (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you know, I mean, a guy like -- a business guy like -- like  a Ken Lagone has been on this program and said, I don't want this Social  Security check that I get.  I don't need it. </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Don't send it to him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So I'm just saying there are certain -- there are certain  pockets of the population that understand that this is not happening over  the long term.  And they're not expecting it.  </p><p> And yet, the leadership is afraid.  They're afraid to make that move  because that will be the political ad (ph), they took your Social Security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  It's well (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's the granny off the cliff ad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we roll (ph) that.  I'm just kidding.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But it's also real.  I was at a town hall yesterday where a  woman was in tears saying, I depend on this.  So please tell me you're not  going to cut this (ph).  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But this is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  So it is very real.  </p><p> Jon:  But they have a very hard time getting across the message that we're  not going to take away from you but we want to give people 10, 20, 30 years  to prepare to work a few extra months in their life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It means you have to educate the public.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And then but anytime they try to raise that idea, it  immediately gets translated into you're taking Social Security checks away  from older people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, last night, former President George W. Bush sat  down for interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.  The former president  said he was frustrated when U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq.  </p><p> But he still believes ISIS can be defeated.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Yes, it frustrated me.  And it -- I  think what people have got to realize is this bunch of thugs can be  defeated because we did so with the surge.  And we can win again.  </p><p> And so you've heard both presidents after my time say we're going to  degrade and defeat ISIS.  And I say, go get them because they can be  degraded and defeated.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because when you look back at some  of the -- the -- some of the conversation that President Bush has had as it  relates to this topic in the past, he's been very clear.  He said, if we  pull out of Iraq, this will create another problem.  </p><p> This will motivate and empower another group.  And we don't know what their  names are right now.  </p><p> This was years ago, he said this.  And now we know what happened.  ISIS was  created.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  We  -- we (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that it was reassuring to see  General Mattis go to Iraq.  He knows that.  </p><p> The civil war that if we pull out of Iraq at this point -- we -- we have to  discuss actually adding troops.  We have several thousand troops still in  Iraq.  </p><p> We have to discuss that.  That's why General Mattis was so reassuring to  see him pay that visit very early on in the Trump administration.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Jon?  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well -- and we're -- we're seeing the Iraqis now make some  progress and in Mosul, though it's a tough battle.  We had a story in the  paper the other day about how ISIS is using drones against Iraqi forces.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, right, I saw that.  That was inside (ph).  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  If he says we're going to defeat ISIS in his speech tonight,  he's going to get a sounding -- a standing ovation.  People want him to do  this.  </p><p> And hearing George Bush.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .say yes, we -- we've done it before -- we can do this, we  can defeat these barbarians, people want to hear that.  He'll get  bipartisan support on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and Mark Penn just said, he needs to get the room on  their feet.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .and in unity.  We'll see about that.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, tweeting may be to blame for Oscar's biggest  mistake in history.  </p><p> We'll tell you what happened behind the scenes.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's true.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was Twitter.  And then failure to launch, fearsome (ph)  delays in Tesla's Model 3 release causing stocks to turn downward -- the  impact next, back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We're coming to you live from our country's capital with the  gorgeous sunrise behind us as you see there.  </p><p> We are enjoying this beautiful moment here in Washington as we preview the  president's speech tonight.  Markets are looking flat.  </p><p> But we're watching a couple of names on the move.  Target shares -- the one  to watch this morning.  That stock is plummeting in the premarket.  </p><p> The retailer missed earnings expectations.  They missed it on both revenue  and earnings this morning with their quarterly report.  </p><p> Earnings in the fourth quarter -- a dollar $0.45 a -- lower than the -- a  dollar $0.45 a share.  That was lower than the estimate which called for a  dollar $0.51 a share.  </p><p> Target shares look like this this morning, down better than 12 percent.  It  is down about 12 percent on Target.  </p><p>Tesla also a name to watch.  The stock is down following a downgrade from  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman is lowering its price target on the stock from  $1.90 to $1.85.  </p><p> And they issued a sell (ph) rating on Tesla.  That rating is centered on  concerns over the company's upcoming Model 3 sedan.  </p><p> We're watching Priceline this morning.  The company's fourth quarter  earnings topped expectations.  Priceline reported earnings of $14.21 a  share, versus the $13.01 that was expected.  </p><p> The stock is up better than 11 percent this year alone.  Meanwhile, another  accident with a float marring the carnival celebration in Rio de Janeiro.   Cheryl Casone with the details now.  </p><p> Cheryl?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So it's the second float accident in Rio this week.   This time, the top of a he float collapsed with dancers on board.  </p><p> And 11 people were injured, two of those victims said to be in serious  condition, one with head trauma.  The parade had to be stopped for almost  25 minutes so the injured could get medical attention.  </p><p> The show was allowed to go on.  Now, police are investigating the cause of  that accident.  On Sunday, you may remember, 20 people were hurt when a  float crashed into a fence.  </p><p> Well, Warren Buffett has taken a bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway's stake at Apple now more than double what it was at the  start of the year.  </p><p> Berkshire now owns about 133 million shares of Apple.  At the end of last  year, that figure was 57 million.  </p><p> After the recent Apple buying spree, Berkshire Hathaway's stake now sits at  about $18 billion.  Well, Starbucks introducing two new drinks just in time  for spring.  </p><p> The Cinnamon Almond Macchiato and the Coconut Macchiato hits stores today  for at least a limited time.  Starbucks is also making another addition --  it's not to the menu, though.  </p><p> They are going to open one of the roasteries in Milan, Italy in late 2018,  marking their first store in Italy.  Starbucks plans to open nearly 30  roasteries worldwide, we should say.  </p><p> And it turns out the ratings were also a big blunder Sunday night.  The  Oscar's ratings tanked the lowest in nine years -- just 32.9 million  viewers turned in.  </p><p> That is more than a million less than last year.  And now, we're learning  more about the best picture disaster -- an Oscar first.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JORDAN HOROWITZ, \"LA LA LAND\" PRODUCER:  There's -- there's a mistake.   \"Moonlight,\" you guys won best picture.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  \"Moonlight\" won.  This is not a joke.  </p><p> HOROWITZ:  This is not a joke.  I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not a joke.  \"Moonlight\" has won best picture.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  So what's the Pricewaterhouse Coopers, who caused the disaster,  distracted just minutes before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong  envelope, he tweeted this photo of best actress winner, Emma Stone,  backstage.  Now, the mix-up happened just three minutes later when he  handed Beatty the wrong envelope.  </p><p> Cullinan's tweets reportedly not sanctioned by the academy.  He deleted the  tweet later and all other posts that he had made during the show, Maria.  </p><p> So the story continues.  And that's it.  Back to you out in D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So he was tweeting and maybe got distracted and gave the wrong  envelope.  Oops.  Yes, big oops.  </p><p> All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, it's a done deal.   Antonio Brown, now the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL -- details on  his massive new contract next, back in a moment, live from Washington on a  beautiful Tuesday morning.       </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Pittsburgh Steelers making Antonio Brown the  NFL's highest-paid wide receiver yesterday, Jared max with the details now. </p><p> Jared, good morning to you.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Antonio Brown  has caught more passes in the last four years than any receiver in NFL  history during the same time span.  </p><p> To the Pittsburgh Steelers, that's what Brown can do for you.  Now, we see  what you did for him.  </p><p> The Steelers yesterday announced that Antonio Brown, who caught 12  touchdowns and totaled 1,300 yards last season, has signed a new contract  to keep him in a Steelers uniform through 2021.  It includes a $19 million  signing bonus and Brown's four-year extension calls for $68 million,  average salary $17 million a year, $2 million more than Cincinnati's A.J.  Green.  </p><p> Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Tim Tebow, got into the batter's  box for the first time yesterday at New York Mets spring training at Port  St. Lucie, Florida.  Now, 29 years old and trying to make another career in  professional baseball, Tebow showed off his strength.  </p><p> Florida Gators legend smashed nine home runs in batting practice yesterday,  impressed some baseball scouts.  Adidas, all day I dream about sand --  check this out, Adidas says it's giving away an island to any pro-football  prospect at the NFL Combine who can break the record for the fastest 40- yard dash at the Combine, which is 4.7 seconds set by Chris Johnson nine  years ago.  </p><p> But the player would have to be wearing these Adidas -- Adizero 5-Star 40  Cleats and agree to wear them for the entire upcoming season.  Now, should  a player break the record, he could wind up with his own island, Adidas  says, as soon as reasonably possible.  </p><p> Or Adidas could also just pay the athlete $1 million.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, Jared, that's -- that's pretty incredible.  I want  to switch gears and ask you about Warren Buffett announcing yesterday that  employees have a chance to win a million dollars for a year for life.  They  only have to predict the correct Sweet 16 for the NCAA men's basketball  tournament.  </p><p> What do you think about that?  Do you think somebody will actually predict  the Sweet 16 perfectly? </p><p> MAX:  That's -- that's unlikely.  I mean, that's predicting 16 out of 16  from a field that (ph) starts with, what, 68 teams.  </p><p> But they've done this contest before Warren Buffett -- last year, Warren  Buffett had -- he gave out $50,000 to two different employees for each  guessing the most correct picks during the NCAA tournament.  And there was  also a time when he gave away money for the most consecutive picks during  the tournament.  </p><p> I love seeing these new contests that -- that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MAX:  .are going on in sports.  I mean, this Adidas thing and you know,  this -- it's cool stuff.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who's going to predict the perfect Sweet 16?  Come on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's mathematically impossible almost.  It's literally  impossible to predict the Sweet 16.  There's no chance in a pot fiery hell  (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No wonder Buffett says you can have a million dollars.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's why -- that's why he's making -- that's why he's making  the offer.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right, exactly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  No way (ph) beyond (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .are in his favor (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared, pretty -- pretty tough odds there.  Jared  Max, thank you.  You should catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News  Headlines 24/7 everyday or check him out on Sirius XM 115.  </p><p> Coming up next, hitting the breaks -- Uber seeing setbacks with the self- driving fleet after reports of traffic violations -- more on the  investigation next hour.

Welcome back.   Thank you so much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo right  here in D.C.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your top stories right now 8:00  a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump will address a joint session of  congress tonight for the first time as commander-in-chief.  The president  is expected to stress unity during his speech, however before taking the  stage the president blamed his predecessor for tensions in the country.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I think that President Obama  is behind it because his people are certainly behind it.  And some of the  leaks possibly come from that group, you know, some of the leaks which are  really very serious leaks because they're very bad in terms of national  security.  But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him  being behind things, that's politics, and it will probably continue.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's speech tonight, the address begins at 9:00 pm Eastern and we  will be there live with analysis for you right after.  A miraculous story  of survival, a small plane crashes into a home killing three people but a  cheerleader onboard is alive this morning.  The details coming up.  Target  shares sinking in premarket this morning, the retail admits expectations on  both revenue and earnings.</p><p> The stock is plummeting down 13 percent, we will break down the numbers  coming up.  And Oh Snap, the parent company of Snapchat expected debut on  Wall Street Thursday.  What you need to know ahead of the highly  anticipated IPO in environment where we haven't seen a lot of IPOs.   Meanwhile, it could be a record day on Wall Street today.  Take a look at  futures indicating a flat opening this morning, this has been the situation  every morning and yet at the end of the day we see another record-high  close.  Another gain today would be a 13th record close in a row that is  never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.</p><p> In Europe this morning stocks are searching for direction, take a look at  Eurozone indices with the FT 100 up just a fraction in the CAC Quarante.   And the DAX Index lower.  And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed, take a  look, the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, the weakest link down 3/4 of 1  percent.  Well, a tweet maybe to blame for the for biggest mistake in Oscar  history  Plus the best picture snafu not only thing plaguing the years'  award shows.  The details after Hollywood's big night delivers a ratings  bomb.</p><p> All of those stories coming up.  And joining me this morning to talk all  about it, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's  global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath, and Fox News Contributor, Rachel  Campos-Duffy.  Good to see you.</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Great show so far you guys.</p><p> JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Great to be here.  A lot of  excitement building up before the president gives his second big speech.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you've been great in terms of really outlining what's  important tonight.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  More spending on military, more spending on  infrastructure, less spending on domestic programs and importantly, the  state department outreach to rest of the world, America first.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen?  You're absolutely right.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  And don't forget, we're going to all be  looking to see what Melania Trump is wearing tonight.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's important.  That's important. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And also that President Trump is not going to touch Medicare or  Social Security which was something that he said on the campaign trail but  to people worried about the national debt and the looming tidal wave of the  tsunami of the entitlement programs.  I think that that's of note and of  concern.  And by the way, I still want to point out that if this president  and this congress gets bogged down in the repeal and replace of Obamacare  and you start getting toward the end of 2017, with a tax reform, that's  going to be not good news for the markets.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's why, you know, we're talking about the market  potentially a record 13th straight day of increases is -- at some point the  market is going to stay -- is going to ask is it delivering, are we -- are  we getting what he -- what he promised?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And a lot of hangs in the balance.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're talking about that this morning. Joining the  conversation, former chief of staff under President Clinton, Mack McLarty  is with us this morning.  President George W. Bush's former undersecretary  of defense for policy, Doug Feith is with us and the host of Varney and  Company, Stuart Varney will weigh in as well.  We got a big program ahead.   So just stay with us for this hour.  We kick it off right now with our top  story and that is the president set to outline this is agenda tonight on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  During his  address to a joint session of congress tonight.  Peter Barnes is live at  the White House right now with the details.  Peter, good morning to you.</p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning,  Maria.  That's right.  We got more details from the president aides about  tonight's speech, they say the president will talk about his  accomplishments during his first month or so here in office including those  executive orders and possibly talks about companies, about keeping and  creating jobs in the United States, he will also discuss that range of  issues that you just mentioned.  And maybe he'll take a little credit for  the stock market and those recent records he did on Fox and Fiends this  morning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  You take a look at what's going on with the stock market, trillions  of dollars of value have been created since I won election, I mean  trillions, and -- in fact it was very interesting on Friday, it looked like  for the first time in 11 or 12 sessions the market might go down a little  bit and it was down, down, down, it was like 15 seconds left and all of a  sudden it shut up.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES:  Now, the big initiative he'll discuss tonight of course is his  plan to ask congress for $54 billion in additional spending on defense, his  aides say that the 10 percent increase, defense stocks have been up on that  news and administration official also saying the broad theme of the speech  tonight is the renewal of the American spirit and an optimistic vision for  all Americans, Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Peter, thank you so much.  Peter Barnes with the  latest there.  I want to bring in Mack McLarty right now, he is former  chief of staff under President Clinton.  Mack it's good to see you.  Thank  you so much for joining us.</p><p> MACK MCLARTY, FORMER CLINTON WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF:  Maria, always  good to be with you.  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What do you want to hear from the President tonight.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  I'd like to hear really, first, the concrete outline of what he's  going to do, I think the speech will be more positive.  I think he will  call for unity, how that proceeds, we'll have to wait and see.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, what -- let me -- look, we know roughly speaking that he  wants to increase military spending, we know that roughly speaking he wants  to come out with a tax plan and repeal and replace Obamacare, are you  onboard with those initiatives? </p><p> MCLARTY:  Not totally.  I think he will lay out his framework, you know,  the president proposes the congress disposes, and so he will lay out his  framework, it will work its way through the congress and the various  committees.  I think there's already been concern expressed about the very  substantial increase in the military budget.  We all want to support our  troops, we've had 15 years of war, equipment been depleted, there's no  question.</p><p> On the other hand is someone who had the privilege to work with president,  who did balance the budget.  I am concerned about the budget and the impact  there and you even have the military speaking about not weakening the state  department.  It's essentially we have soft diplomacy and engagement as well  as strong military power.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Jon?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Can we talk about the White House, you ran a White House,  there is a lot of different factions in this White House, we have -- we  have budget hawks, we have the populous wing of Bannon, we have  nationalists, what is your read of how this -- how this White House is  operating and the factions there, is it any different than anything you --  that you saw when you running the White House?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, lift-offs are always a challenge in any White House and  President Trump came from outside, Governor Clinton came from being a  governor.  After 12 years the republicans being in office, but I think  Reince Priebus is capable, first, he knows Washington, there are always  power senators in Washington.  This is not unique to Trump administration  but they need to prioritize and get a handle on what they're doing and move  forward with their plan not unlike what Maria just outlined on the speech  and this is a  good evening to do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And are they all in line do you think?  I mean, when you look  at what the priorities are from counselors around him to his Chief of Staff  Reince Priebus?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, Maria, a couple of points.  I think you want different  points of view in any White House, any president wants different or CEOs or  whatever.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You don't want yes men around.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  But the -- but the challenge for Chief Priebus is to be an honest  broker, and it's the same thing with the national security advisor to take  those different views, put them in a form that gives the president the  option to making decision and then close on a decision.  That's what  important in any platform.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  How will the democrats going to treat -- </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, we were talking about that earlier, I hope carefully and  nimbly, I mean, if he calls for more jobs, do you stand and applaud for  that or not?  And so it's going to be tricky for them, I think they need to  pick their disagreements so to speak very carefully.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I think you make a great point and it's a good question  because tonight we know that there will be protesters outside.  Tonight we  know that there will be guests of certain democrats who may actually, you  know, resist what the president's policies are.  How should President Trump  handle that?  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, he's had some practice at handling it during the campaign.   And it could play in his favour.  I hope though tonight, not to be  pollyannaish but I hope deny, I mean, it's a serious address about serious  issues.  It's a call for unity, it's a very serious thoughtful speech and  it's received in that manner.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think there are some dangers for the democrats in this, I  mean, some of the guests that they've invited are people we would expect  but there is talk that they may have given some of these extra tickets to  protesters who may jump up and we saw the reaction that, you know, when Joe  Wilson said, you lie, you know, I mean, people do expect the sense of  decorum and respect for the office of president and should something happen  that's very disruptive or disrespectful, you know, we see the numbers for  the -- whole numbers saying that the country is moving -- saying that we're  moving in the right direction, what happens to democrats if they just look  like the party of resistance of disruption, and just really trying to put a  stop to him even just getting off the ground and even with -- Barack Obama  looking like he's beating this maybe from a few miles away.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  I would take a little exception to your final point but I think  your other points were appropriately made and if you look at the  democratically governors, association and their comments, they made very  much -- as very much the same thing that you just echoed, we've got to be  for something else as democrats.  We got to before a growth agenda, how are  we going to get this economy moving that includes everybody.  So they just  can't be against President Trump.  They need to pick and pick their battles  very carefully.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do they have that?  I mean, is there something that they're  for other than being against Donald Trump?</p><p> MCLARTY:  Oh, I think you're seeing that emerge, Maria.  And I think it's  frankly, early in Trump administration and early in terms of the democrats  getting all of their programs together and moving forward.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You said -- you said you take issue with what Rachel just said.   I want to play you a sound bite from President Trump and he basically says  no, President Obama is behind some of this.  Listen to this.</p><p> MCLARTY:  OK.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it, I also think it's politics, that's the  way it is and look I have a -- </p><p> BRIAN KILMEADE, FOX NEWS HOST, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\":  But bush wasn't going  after Clinton, Clinton wasn't going after bush.  </p><p> TRUMP:  Well, you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes,  you know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  You  know, I think that President Obama is behind it because his people is  certainly are behind it.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  is it -- is it a stretch to say that his people are behind the  protesters and loyalists to President Obama?</p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, I think there is some natural disagreement from people that  supported President Obama or perhaps when President Obama's administration.   I think President Trump said you never know is probably the key phrase but  to say I think and suggest that President Obama is personally engaged, I  don't think there is any real evidence to suggest that's the case. </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's definitely encouraged it through statements that he  made and I would say that it's -- I don't think we should normalize a  president -- an ex-president not really sort of giving the new president a  chance to -- I mean this is a highly unusual the level of involvement and I  mean, most presidents sort of recede into background.  </p><p> MCLARTY:  Well, President Bush certainly did and President Clinton did  although President Trump has been pretty critical of President Obama, so in  this counter punching narrative that President Trump has put forward, you  could -- you could say that but I don't expect President Obama to be  actively engaged.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So tonight, it will be a success if? </p><p> MCLARTY:  If one --it's a positive speech as kind of -- as of kind of a  Ronald Reaganess or Bill Clintoness, positive view, let's move forward  together and it has some specific and it -- that at least have some  possibility for common ground of bipartisan support.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Mack, good to see you.</p><p> MCLARTY:  We'll see.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Mack McLarty there, Fox  Business is taking you live to the president's joint address to congress  tonight 9:00 pm Eastern, so stay with us as we have a full coverage  tonight.</p><p> Coming up.  We will Snapchat and will company have a picture-perfect debut  on Wall Street, new details on Snap's hotly anticipated IPO.  Target stocks  sinking in the premarket down 13 percent after disappointing fourth  quarter, a closer look at the company's earnings.  Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane crashing into two houses in  Southern California.  Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now.   Cheryl.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  So, Maria fire officials say one  teenager was thrown from a backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl  only had minor injuries.  Three people were killed when the aircraft  crashed shortly after taking off from Riverside Municipal Airport.  The  cell phone video caught the moment of the crash, you can see huge flames  and thick smoke following that explosion.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the backhouse of the neighbors, they're exiting an elderly man,  exiting firefighters were taking people to safety.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well, a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on that plane.   They were flying home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  </p><p> Well, analysts at UBS say the Costco may boost their membership fee in the  next few months.  UBS putting out a note to investors saying the warehouse  chain fees for basic membership likely going to increase by $5 that means  it will be $60.  UBS is the fee for a Costco executive membership going to  rise by 10, they will make it 120 every year.  It affirms that Costco might  announce those hikes on Thursday when they release a second quarter  earnings.</p><p> Costco recently did increase their membership fees by 10 percent in other  countries, they did it in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Mexico even the U.K.   Costco has not confirmed it but during an earnings call in December, the  CEO said the time might be actually ripe for that fee hike, so we'll see on  Thursday.  Well, President Donald Trump preparing to address a joint  session of congress for the first time tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming up.  We have to  understand Obamacare has been a disaster.  It's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border and remember  this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting the bad ones  out, the bad people.  Gang members, druglords, and some cases murderers.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  And the president also we should say expected to declare early  progress on his campaign promises.  Well, let's take a look at Target  shares, they're being hit pretty hard this morning guys.  The company  reported sales and earnings that missed Wall Street expectations.  Target  was hurt by a disappointing holiday quarter, we talking about it this  morning.  There is the stock.  Earnings came in buck 45 a share, they  missed the estimate 1.51, they also said the outlook for fiscal year 2017  is also, Maria, going to miss analysts expectation.  So it was about the  holiday quarter certainly the retailers under pressure because of folks  like Amazon.  And those are your headlines.  Back to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  For sure that's it.  Tough quarter for Target.  Thank you  so much, Cheryl.  And we are back with our panel, Dagen McDowell, Jon  Hilsenrath, Rachel Campos-Duffy.  Tonight, the big night.  First time we'll  hear from the president since inauguration day, Rachel.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Absolutely.  And, you know, this is the prime time address.   It's not in the middle of the day, expect huge ratings, expect them to talk  about these ratings especially with -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  God, you're right.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  -- the Oscar ratings down, I think he's going to take a lot  of pleasure in seeing his own ratings going up.  This guy knows how to do a  show, he's very unpredictable.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think it's going to be very interesting, I know I  mentioned Melania and Ivanka in what they're going to wear, listen, this is  a huge rebound of the image for the republican party, highly fashionable  women.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  I think -- I think it's -- I think this is the real moment  for the republicans.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  There's two things on that we're looking at.  One is, there's  going to be so much attention in who's in the gallery above all these  dignitaries down on the floor.  So much talk about who the democrats are  inviting, who republicans are inviting.  I think we're going to hear more  about that that than we usually do.  That's one thing.  The other thing,  something we've been talking about all morning, Maria is immigration, what  is the president's stand on immigration.  You've been distinguishing -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  We know where it stands on immigration.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  No, no.  But this is -- but this is the important point  between legal and illegal immigration.  If we're going to hit growth  targets of three percent or more, we actually need more legal immigration  and not less of it because the population is aging and --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  Yes.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- because we have all these baby boomers retiring.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  The barrier has always been the wall and that's what -- and  border security.  So, if you want immigration reform, you first have to  secure the border and I think that's something -- he's a populist because  that's actually very popular to secure our border and getting out violent  criminals and other very popular.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Very popular.  Absolutely.  Dagen, I mean, look, we have been  talking about differentiating legal from illegal because in some of the  circles here, particularly the democrats bringing their guest tonight,  they're confusing it.  I mean, as if the president doesn't want legal  immigration.  I mean, has he said he doesn't want legal -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That -- this has been the opportunity for him to make that  distinction of the liberals and the democrats always talk about immigration  as a whole, that's not what we're talking about.  We're talking about  securing the homeland period.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely right.  Still ahead President Trump seeks to  beef up the nation's military.  Meanwhile, the defense spending increase  expected in the White House as first fiscal budget.  That budget will be  out in the next week.  And then, the biggest technology IPOs since  Facebook.  Everything you need to know about Snap's hotly anticipated Wall  Street debut this week.  Back in a moment.  .  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Wall Street gears up for one of the biggest  intelligent IPOs in years, Snap, the parent company Snapchat however is not  expected to follow the same path as other social media giants that have  gone public like Facebook and Twitter.  Unlike other Silicon Valley giants,  Snap does not have a headquarters and its cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel is  an unconventional leader, that's according to the Wall Street Journal.  Jon  Hilsenrath here today, taking a look at it.  How will the Snap's IPO you  think be different than Facebook.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, our story today is all about the unusual  leadership of Snap CEO who is not a very open communicative person, doesn't  like to have big meetings with his -- with his staff.  So, I think there's  going to be some questions about management, how is -- how is management  going to run the company.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, I tell you one thing that he got right, not to sell for  $3 billion back in the day, right?  Who offered $3 billion and then -- and  remember the -- oh, this is just crazy.  Why would you not sell?  You just  offered $3 billion and here he is with a $20 plus billion IPO.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And he's engaged to Miranda Kerr, the actress who's Orlando  Bloom former homegirl if you will.  So there you go.  So we know that about  him, there might be a lose but he's got a model on his arm.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  I think it's a -- it's a big test for Wall Street because this  is our first big tech IPO in a while and, you know, we have to see if Wall  Street really embraces this like the Facebook.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think that's a great point because this is not a good IPO  period right now.  It is not a lot of I big deals.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  It hasn't been but Wall Street is on fire now.  So if we get a  very hot IPO out of Snap and it could be something that adds a little  momentum.  </p><p> CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  I'll tell you who's embracing it, it is young people, I  mean, my teens are on, you know, they love this stock.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But how loyal will they be two years from now, even two months  from now. </p><p> CAMPOSO-DUFFY:  They move on to another thing.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  Look at this.  Is it -- is it Facebook or is it Twitter  is going to be big question --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- to buy the IPO -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But Rich Peterson, it has to be capitalized uses, looks as if  February 2017 will be the lowest monthly count of IPOs since March when --  of '16 when just four IPOs price.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And how o do you reconcile that with the fact that -- look at  -- look at the NASDAQ, look how high it is, you know, you would think in a  market like this that more companies will be coming out in IPOing, so if  you get a good one out of Snap then you might see some others following  behind it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I wondered why because normally you want to go public when the  markets are rallying and when it's really strong performance and yet you're  just not seeing that.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And maybe it's a sign that this momentum we're  seeing in the market is not sustainable.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But we'll see, I mean, look, the markets are waiting for tax  reform, right, Dagen?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we will be talking about this forever here, but we're up 13  percent since election day.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And you've also seen the bonds rising along with stocks  which is unusual, so somebody is wrong in that equation, either gross loss  either or risky assets, you know, risk your assets.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  We had a story in the paper just yesterday about how a better  reversal, we're starting to see people buying bonds again which is another  --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right.  I said bonds rising.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  Prices are rising, yields are falling which is a sign  that maybe people are starting to question the kind of growth that --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Hey, I read the journal, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Oh, I know.  I know you do.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And she's been talking about that for some time as well.  We'll  take a short break.  When we come back, building a better defense,  President Trump's pledge to increase military spending.  Where the money  will come to from to pay for it.  And then a bigger buyout of Apple, why  Warren Buffet is doubling down on Apple shares.  Back in a moment. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Good Tuesday morning, welcome back everybody.  I'm Maria  Bartiromo, this morning in Washington.  It is Tuesday, February 28th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  President Trump, set to  address the Joint Session of Congress tonight, for the first time since  taking office.  The Commander in Chief is expected to address many issues,  including taking care of our veterans.  Earlier in the program I spoke with  Secretary of Veterans Affairs, David Shulkin, about his role so far. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  I've been in government now  about 18 months, that's long enough to understand how this system works and  where the problems are.  And my discussions with the President have been  that we have to make these changes quickly, and being able to know where  the problems are, is going to allow us to do that as quick as we need to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  address tonight at 9:00 p.m. Eastern, join are us throughout the day today,  for full analysis as well.  As the President prepares to address Congress,  his Cabinet is one step closer to being complete.  The Senate confirming  Wilbur Ross as Commerce Secretary, in a 72 to 27 vote last night.  He will  be sworn into office this morning.  Target shares are sinking in the pre- market, the retailer missed expectations on both revenue and earnings per  share.  We have breaking down numbers, coming up. </p><p> Warren Buffett, meanwhile, taking a big bite out of Apple: why the  billionaire invertor's betting big on Apple shares?  And it could be a  record day on Wall Street, Futures indicating: markets will open like this.   We are off of the highs and certainly, we're pretty flat to the -- to the  break-even line.  If we do see a record today, because this has been the  case open: we open lower, and then by the end of the day, close higher.   The gain would be a 13th record close, in a row, that has never happened in  the Dow's 120-year history.  </p><p> We're just getting breaking news right now; fourth quarter GDP is out.  The  fourth quarter grew at a rate of 1.9 percent, this is the second estimate;  this is below expectations.  The estimate calls for growth of 2.1 percent.   The GDP hitting the tape right now: markets, as you see, are reacting.  In  Europe, stocks are searching for direction this morning, take a look at  Eurozone indices and you will see fractional moves up in London and in  Paris, but even the DAX Index actually has turned positive.  The European  markets are actually, trading higher even if just by a fraction.  </p><p> And in Asia, overnight, markets were mixed, take a look, the big loser  there was the Hang Seng in Hong Kong: down three quarters of one percent.   Well, a picture of Kellyanne Conway, goes viral, but will the White House  take the criticism sitting down?  We'll talk about that picture, that's  going viral.  Plus, a tweet maybe to blame, a tweet for the biggest mistake  in Oscar history.  Why the man in charge, of the envelopes, may have been  more concerned with social media, and sending out tweets and pictures than  handing over the right envelope.  Our top story this half hour, President  Trump focusing on defense.  Trump is seeking a historic $54 billion  increase in defense spending, while pursuing cuts everywhere else.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  40 days, after his inauguration, President Trump and  Republican Congress will have -- not lifted a finger to create jobs, raise  wages for hardworking American families.  These actions will worsen the  conditions that fueled his candidacy, President Trump engaged in a bait and  -- a bait and switch agenda: no jobs, no retirement security, and no health  security.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO: Yes.  I just want to point out that he is seeking cuts  elsewhere, but not everywhere else, pardon me on that.  Joining us right  now is the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, under Bush 43,  Doug Feith is with us.  Under Secretary, good to see you.  Thank you so  much for joining us.  </p><p> DOUG FEITH, UNITED STATES DEFENSE FOR POLICY UNDER SECRETARY UNDER GEORGE  W. BUSH:  Glad to be with you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you.  So, the President says, he wants the U.S. to be  better prepared if called to fight.  What's your take on these expectations  that he wants to raise military spending by $54 billion? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, the defense budget was pretty severely slashed throughout the  Obama administration, and the Unites States continues to have large  worldwide defense responsibilities.  But we have not had a budget in recent  years that allow us to -- that allows us to actually, have the kind of  military capabilities that would allow to us fulfill responsibilities.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, you want to see this?  You want to see more spending on  military then?  </p><p> FEITH:  I do.  I think it's an important thing, I think that we have large  parts of our infrastructure.  There -- recently, there've been some  attention paid to how our nuclear infrastructure for example, has  deteriorated greatly.  That's enormously dangerous, if countries around the  world that have depended on Unites States for decades, for their security  because of our nuclear umbrella?  Begin to worry about the integrity of our  nuclear umbrella, because we haven't been investing enough.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> FEITH:  That's -- that makes for a much more dangerous world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, it sure does.  Dagen?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The Trump administration's proposal will take the defense budget  to $603 billion, that's still short of say, what a Senator John McCain  wants, which is closer to $640 billion.  Do you think that the Trump  administration should do even more, in terms of increasing the defense  spending?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, there're a lot of details to be debated, but I think that  what Senator McCain has said, Representative Thornberry has said in the  House, have to be taken seriously.  That there's going to be a debate  between mysterious people in Congress that are looking to pitch on the  Armed Services Committees in the House, and the Senate, and the  administration, and I think there is a strong argument to be made that the  administration has not gone far enough.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  There's going to be a debate within Trump administration  too because Mick Mulvaney, who's the Budget Director, has been kind of a  deficit hawk.  And that's one of the reasons that Senator McCain didn't  trickily care for.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Well, and I think that people are perfectly happy with  seeing us upgrade airplanes, and our ships, and armor for our troops, but a  lot of people see that there's some fat to be cut in the Pentagon.  And so,  maybe, sort of being, in between where Barack Obama was, and not quite  where John McCain wants him to be, means that, you know, military will have  to find ways where they can streamline in, and do things more efficiently,  so they can, you know, meet budget cuts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can he do that?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, it's -- this is a perennial question.  It's always a good  idea to cut fat.  I don't think that you're going to be able to solve the  problem simply by cutting the fat.  The amount of -- the serious harm that  was done, by the see quest ration cuts throughout the Obama years needs to  be remedied.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, let's talk about that.  I mean, go through for us the more  important areas of the military where you believe need love, frankly?  I  mean, we've got the oldest navy in decades, oldest army in decades, how you  characterize and assess where we we're today, and what needs to be done? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I mean, I think you flag some of the major issues, the our --  our navy needs more platforms, we need more capabilities in basically all  of the services.  We have -- we have for example, in Asia, had a policy  that at the beginning of the Bush administration we said, the real  strategic interests of the Unites States, require us to build up our  capabilities in Asia.  Some work was done in that regard.  Then President  Obama came in, and made the point about pivoting to Asia, which was a way  of essentially reaffirming, that we need to do more to focus on our  strategic interests in Asia, because Asia is both economically and  strategically enormously important.  In order to do what we need to do in  Asia, we need long range military capabilities, that's air capabilities,  naval capabilities, and the like.  All of that is enormously expensive and  requires us to build up our forces.  </p><p> DUFFY:  Donald Trump has said that he's -- he's asking these other  countries that have been benefiting from our military expenditures to step  up.  So, is that going to reduce some of the financial pressure on us? </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I think that -- President Trump has said some things that I  think have some merit, and are also a problem.  </p><p> DUFFY:  OK.  </p><p> FEITH:  What he said that has merit is, what every American President in  basically since the cold war began, was saying, which is we would like  greater contributions from our allies.  That's another perennial debate.  </p><p> DUFFY:  But he seems to mean it, right?</p><p> FEITH:  Well, he has -- he has also said some things that I think were  really not constructive, and not accurate, about how some of our key allies  are free loaders.  I don't think that's a fair -- I don't think that's a  fair description.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Are you reassured by General Mattis, running the Defense  Department though?  Because he has gone against things that his boss,  President Trump has said, whether it's about torture, whether it's where  not taking Iraq's oil, whether it's standing by our NATO allies, does that  reassure you? </p><p> FEITH:  It does.  I think that General Mattis is understanding of the  importance of our alliances, is far more sound than the campaign rhetoric  that came from Mr. Trump, during the campaign, and even unfortunately some  of the things he said since he's been President.  But I hope that he -- I  hope that President Trump will take advice on what remains to be seen.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  How has that comment about what you just said, free loaders?   How has that impacted our friends across the world?  </p><p> FEITH:  Well, I think -- I mean in my conversations with representatives  from a number of those countries, it has made them question whether  President Trump is going to continue to uphold the relationships, continue  to uphold the alliance obligations that we have.  And we -- I don't think  it is in our interests that we call those alliances into question.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What if -- what if some of them should be paying off, right?   How do get to do that? </p><p> FEITH:  As I said, it's been -- it has been a perennial problem that we've  encouraged and not always successfully, our allies to contribute more.  I  am happy to see that some of -- many of our allies are responding to Mr.  Trump by saying that they're going to increase their defense spending.   That's a positive thing, and I give -- I give President Trump credit for  that.  But, you know, this needs to be calibrated correctly to put the  pressure on the allies without making them question fundamentally, whether  we are going to remain true to our commitments.  </p><p> DUFFY:  It's definitely about that, but I can tell you that it really  resonates with the American people, when they hear Donald Trump tell them:  you have to care more about your liberty and freedom than we do.  And I  think that -- and Americans feel like, some of them are free loaders.  And  I don't know what a President can -- how do you strike that balance between  making them feel like, you know, we're not going -- we're not going to  leave you, that at the same time, putting enough pressure verbally on them.   At least, to get them to pay their fair share.  </p><p> FEITH:  You know, I see the -- I see the populist appeal of that kind of  rhetoric.  But I think it's very short sided because, what I am focused on,  is the interests of the American people.  It is not in our interests to  have our allies doubt our reliability.  That ultimately is not a way to  punish allies that you think are not contributing enough, we're going to be  punishing ourselves if we damage these alliances -- these alliances.  </p><p> And I really think that a responsible American official would be making  this clear to the American public.  These alliances, have kept the security  situation relatively quiet around a large part of the world, to be enormous  benefit of the American people.  It has created a platform on which an  enormous amount of economic growth has occurred, where trade occurs.  And  if we damage that general structure for security in the world, we are  damaging our own economy.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, of course.  Great to have your insights, Doug.  Thanks so  much.  We appreciate you joining us today.  Under Secretary, Doug Feith,  joining us.  Fox Business Network is taking you live to the President's  Joint Address to Congress tonight.  Join us, for our special coverage all  day, and leading up to the address at 9:00 p.m. tonight.  And we'll be live  here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA to have full analysis tomorrow morning.</p><p> Coming up next, markets setting new records under President Trump, but the  mainstream media is focused on the backlash against the President.  Stuart  Varney, sounds off, has some thoughts on that, he's coming up.  Plus, a  Kellyanne Conway photo not sitting well with some of her critics.  Why a  picture of the White House Adviser is going viral this morning.  Back in a  moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, markets are flat this morning although we are  expecting a couple of big movers.  Warren Buffett for example is taking a  bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway stake in Apple is now  more than double what it was at the start of the year.  Berkshire now owns  133 million shares of Apple, it's up from 57 million.  It certainly made  money on that move.  Berkshire Hathaway stake is now about $18 billion.   Take a look at Apple shares right now at $137.05 a share in the premarket.</p><p> We're watching Amazon today.  Time Magazine reporting that the company is  working to give its voice assistance, Alexa, the ability to distinguish who  is talking to it.  The report says that the capability which is being  called Voice I.D., has been in development since 2015.  Amazon shares up  almost three percent this morning in the premarket. </p><p> Markets are poised for their 13th straight record breaking day.  But the  mainstream media seems to be giving the Trump rally the cold shoulder.  A  host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, joins us from New York.  How do  you give this market the cold shoulder?  13 percent since Election Day, six  percent since the start of the year, Stu.  Wow.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST, \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\":  Yes.  And by the way, if we  close, just even one point higher today, it will be truly an historic event  on Wall Street because we've never seen 13 consecutive records in the 120- year history of the Dow Industrials.  Now, look at this, I've got the New  York Times.  I actually paid for a copy this morning, here it is.  It's not  on front page.  No mention of the Wall Street rally. The Trump rally, no  mention whatsoever on the front page.  So, I turned to the business  section.  It's called Business Day.  Not a single notion. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you kidding me? </p><p> VARNEY:  Not a mention.  You go to page B7, to find any mention of the  rally.  I'm looking for it -- fast here.  And it says, \"Wall street closes  at new highs again.\"  It's tucked down at the bottom corner of B7.  So  then, I splashed out big time, went to the Washington Post.  Here it is.   Not on the front page.  They do have an economy section on page eight.   Well what do you think the lead is in the Washington Post on this historic  day?  I will tell you, it is Apple shareholders all set to vote on whether  to force the company to make its leadership more diverse. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> I rest my case.  If this is not the dishonest media.  You know, this is  total dishonesty. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's only $3 trillion in market wealth that has been created.   What do you want?  A whole story on it?  It's only $3 trillion.</p><p> VARNEY:  A trillion here, a trillion there.  Pretty soon, you're talking  big money.  You know what I mean, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  I think so.</p><p> VARNEY:  Look, if people are not watching Fox Business, Maria, Stuart and  everybody else, they wouldn't know that history is being made in our  economy, on our markets, they would not know it.  100 million people will  benefit directly from what we've seen on Wall Street, no mention.   Dishonesty. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I think you make a great point.  Transparency is the issue.</p><p> VARNEY:  My rant is over, OK.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're right, no.  And there is the issue, you are not getting  the full story.  That's the point.  Stuart, thank you.  I know you have  more on this in about 10 minutes and we will see you then. </p><p> VARNEY:  Thanks, Maria. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, 9 a.m. Eastern.   Thank you. Stuart, right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p> Coming up next, ruining the Oscars in 140 characters or less.  Why Twitter  may be to blame for the Best Picture mix-up at the Academy Awards. </p><p> Then, critics claiming that Kellyanne Conway is not putting her best foot  forward in the oval office.  The picture of the White House Adviser going  viral this morning.  Back in a minute.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, get this if.  If photo of White House  Adviser, Kellyanne Conway, is going viral this morning, there's the photo.   Social media erupted after the picture emerged of Conway with her feet on a  couch in the Oval Office.  Joining us right now is political analyst,  Kirsten Haglund, to talk more about this.  Kirsten, good to see you first  of all. </p><p> KIRSTEN HAGLUND, POLITICAL ADVISOR:  Good to see you. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks for joining us.  So, what do you think?  Are her critics  making a big deal out of nothing or does this bother you?</p><p> HAGLUND:  No, this is completely outrageous.  There is about 52,000 tweets  as of this morning about this particular incident.  You know what is just  sad is that it's such a really, really great meeting that's going on in the  Oval Office where that picture is being taken.  It's a meeting with  President Trump, as you can see, with leaders from historically black  colleges and universities.  It's just a really, really incredible thing and  they're shining the spotlight on something that really doesn't even matter.   And I should say, conservatives are quick to jump on President Obama when  he had photo taken of him in the Oval Office with a feet up on the desk or  his feet on the table next to couch.  This is political fodder, we expect  them to do.  But nothing's worse than what happened with Bill Clinton the  in oval office, so I think that people can give Kellyanne a break. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, that's a good point, Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.  Do  we see that kind of reaction to the antics there with Bill Clinton and  Monica Lewinsky and then some?  But then again, Dagen, he put her feet on  the couch in the Oval Office.  How about some respect?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Momma McDowell would say, \"Don't put your feet on the  furniture.\" </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Particularly if it's the Oval Office.  The optics of this are  bad.  And President Trump understands optics better than anybody.  About --  I mean, he is a great showman that does not represent his administration  well.  I don't feel like that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Do we know if she has her shoes on or is she walking around  there? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think if you're -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  I don't know if her shoes are on.  She's clearly trying to take a  better picture.  There are White House photographers there.  She didn't  need taking that picture, she certainly doesn't need it.  I -- listen, I  hate saying this, I'm a big Kellyanne fun, but I have kids, I would be  furious if they sat like that at the neighbor's house, let alone in the  Oval Office. </p><p> FEITH:  Either has her shoes on or her shoes are on the couch. </p><p> HAGLUND:  Which is bad. </p><p> FEITH:  Worse is walking around the Oval Office with no shoes on.  Which is  also -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  Which is bad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, there is a lot of people there, right?  I mean,  this is like an important meeting happening. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's the head of historic black colleges.  That makes it that  much worse, so -- </p><p> HAGLUND:  Listen -- </p><p> FEITH:  It's disrespectful to them.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I'll cruise that both sides of the aisle.  And I don't think  that President Obama should have his feet on the desk and I don't think her  feet should be on this oval.</p><p> HAGLUND:  And I don't think my feet should also be in the Oval Office  either.  So, I think it's all bad. </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's abridged, real far. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Totally agree.  What we want Kirsten, what about this.  We're  learning more about the big blunder, here around the world.  The wrong  movie awarded Best Picture at the Oscars.  So, here's what we know.  The  PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, he is to blame because just minutes  before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong envelope, he tweeted out  a photo of the Best Actress winner, Emma Stone, backstage.  </p><p> The award mix-up happened just three minutes later.  Now, Cullinan's  backstage tweets were reportedly not sanctioned by the Academy and he later  deleted the tweet along with other posts during the show.  So, what about  that Kirsten?  Do you think he deleted the tweets because he didn't want  people to think, \"You were focused on your tweets and you gave Warren  Beatty the wrong envelope,\" which is actually what happened.</p><p> HAGLUND:  Absolutely.  And I'm sure he didn't want PricewaterhouseCoopers  to find out as well.  You know, first I felt bad for this guy.  I thought,  \"Oh, don't publish his name.  Don't publish his photo.  He probably feels  awful already.\"  But then you see these pictures coming out and of course,  you know, you're backstage at a once in a lifetime opportunity, you want to  catch that shot and you want to post it but, you know, people get in  trouble with their posting.  </p><p> Do you know that in the last couple of years, there've been 127 deaths from  people trying to take selfies?  So, you know, we have to be really careful  with what we post, you know.  So, I mean, I originally felt bad for the guy  but you know, you're there to do your job.  You're paid to do one thing  right and look at what happened.  So, I don't think he'll be handing out  envelopes next year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I feel bad for it because I know that when we're live on TV,  I'm over here and I want to get something that our guests said immediately  out.  I want to make sure my followers know what was just said on the show.   I tweeted out really quickly but the truth is, this is to make a big  mistake because you're focusing on too many things.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's your show, though.  It's your show.  That one will show.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.  All right, Kirsten Haglund, good to see  you.  We'll be right back with the final thoughts from our All-Star panel,  right here.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks to our fantastic panel, see you all tomorrow everybody.   \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Here's Stuart.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

Welcome back, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo, coming to you live from Washington, D.C. this morning  ahead of the President's address tonight.  It is Tuesday, February 28th.</p><p> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p> President Trump set to address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time since taking office.  While the Commander-in-Chief is expected  to stress unity during that speech, the guests at the event showed  division.</p><p> President Trump's guests will include victims of illegal immigrant crime  while Democrats have invited immigrants and refugees.  Democrats were on  the attack against President Trump ahead of tonight's speech.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), MINORITY LEADER:  40 days after his inauguration,  President Trump and the Republican congress will have not lifted a finger  to create jobs or raise wages for hard-working families.</p><p> These actions were worst than the conditions that fueled his candidacy.

Stocks are searching for  direction this morning.  European indices up fractionally in London and  Paris but down fractionally in Germany.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets were mixed, as you'll see here again, fractional  moves.

So do stay with us this morning.</p><p> President Trump set to detail his health care and immigration policies as  part of his agenda for his address to a joint session of Congress today.   Members of the House and Senate will not be the only ones in attendance.   Maureen Scalia, the widow of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia will  join first lady Melania Trump at the address.</p><p> Lawmakers are also allowed to bring guests to the President's address.   Some House Democrats are using the opportunity to bring dreamers and other  guests who would be affected by President Trump's immigration policies.</p><p> Joining me right now are Tennessee Congresswoman Marcia Blackburn and Ohio  Congressman Tim Ryan.  It's good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining  us.</p><p> REP. MARCIA BLACKBURN (R), TENNESSEE:  Absolutely.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's a big night. First time we are hearing from the President  since inauguration day.  What do you make of what's happening in terms of  the guests, Congresswoman Blackburn?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Everyone has the opportunity to bring someone; usually get  someone from their district, ties in some way with policies and discussions  that are going on.  And I just hope everyone remembers they are there as a  guest of the House.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about you Congressman Ryan?  </p><p> REP. TIM RYAN (D), OHIO:  Oh, I think it's important to highlight, this has  been a tradition whether it's the President -- who the President invites,  who the first lady invites, who members of Congress invite.  We are  highlighting the fact that there will be hundreds of thousands if not  millions of people thrown off of their health care if there's a complete  repeal of the Affordable Care Act.</p><p> And I think it's important to put faces to that policy issue and let people  look people in the eye and say, you're not going to be covered if we do a  straight repeal.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, we should point out that the President was very clear.   The President said that there's not going to be any interruption and people  will not lose their health care, actually.  That's what the President was  very clear about.  So I don't know -- </p><p> RYAN:  There was a Republican plan that was also put forward that said that  potentially millions of people were going to be thrown off.</p><p> Now, let's go back to the campaign where Trump campaigned at almost every  rally, Marcia and said we are going to rip it up, we're going to throw it  away, we're going to repeal this thing immediately.  He talked for a year  about doing that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not that he would throw anyone off the plan.  </p><p> RYAN:  Well, you can't do both.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  Of course, you can do both.  </p><p> RYAN:  How?  What's the plan?  Tell us what the plan is.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  There is a way to go through this process and to make certain  that what we do is improve the options that are there.  And Tim, you know,  as well as I do, the goal is to make certain that everyone has access to  affordable health care.</p><p> Obamacare is imploding.  It's imploding and it is not affordable.  You can  look at the increase in the insurance rate.  You can talk to those that are  delivering health care and talk about the lack of reimbursement for the  care that is delivered.  And, Maria, the choice is, are you going to have a  system that implodes and have nothing?  Or are we going to fix this so that  there is access to affordable health care for all Americans.  That's the  choice.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And how do you attack this, Congressman, knowing that like in  places like Arizona we are seeing premium increases of 116 percent?   Families cannot afford this.  </p><p> RYAN:  Does it need tweak, fix?  I'm in.  Let's fix it.  There are  obviously issues with something this big, this comprehensive that will need  adjusted as we go, but the reality of it is when you talk about the  Medicaid expansion as John Kasich said on the weekend talk shows, the  governor of Ohio about how many hundreds of thousands of people -- about  700,000 in Ohio have benefited from the Medicaid expansion.  If you look at  the credits that are given to people to help them afford to be able to pay  for health care, those are essential elements of the health care.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you saying you don't want Obamacare touched?  Are you  saying you don't want Obamacare touched?</p><p> RYAN:  No, no, no.  I'm telling you we can fix it if there are undo premium  increases, if there are issues with competition.  How do we fix this?  Why  do we got to repeal it?  Why do you got to throw it out?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because it's too expensive it impacts economic growth.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's right.</p><p> RYAN:  No, no, no, no, no.  Let's dismiss that real quick.  The  Congressional Budget Office -- hold on.  The Congressional Budget Office  said -- </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, I'm not going to let you get by with that.  I'm not going  to let you get by with that.</p><p> RYAN:  This will actually be -- no, no, no.  This is an important point.   You can't let this go unanswered.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's your point?</p><p> RYAN:  The point is that the Congressional Budget Office said in the first  10 years that the Affordable Care Act actually brings down the deficit by  $100 plus billion; in the second ten years it's over a trillion dollars of  deficit reduction on the health care. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think we should have a plan for 20 years and just wait  until it actually -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> RYAN:  This isn't an either-or.  I don't know why it has to be an either- or.  We're all adults here.  Any other situation in your life is an either- or.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Here are the numbers.  If you have 22 million people in what is  the Obamacare realm, you have 11 million people, 12 million people that are  in the Medicaid expansion.  But then when you look at the exchange -- nine  million people, two million people can afford the product without a  subsidy, only two million people.  Seven million people can't afford it  unless they're getting a subsidy.  It is too expensive to afford.</p><p> Now, the other kicker in this is when people get it, you know, what they  say, we can't use it because the deductibles are so high, it's structurally  flawed.  It does not work.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  The deductibles are very (inaudible) that you're always  paying out of your pocket.  You could never actually reach that level.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  It turns out to be major medical.  </p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Can I just ask a quick  question?  So we saw some of the problems with Obamacare over the last four  years -- six years.  There were bills out to help fix some of these  problems.  Where were the Democrats in the fixes over the last five, six  years that the Republicans were putting forward?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good question.  </p><p> RYAN:  That's a very ironic question and the fact that they tried to do a  straight repeal.  How many votes?  60 something.  </p><p> DUFFY:  Some of those bills -- </p><p> RYAN:  And there was throughout the whole process of actually trying to put  it together, we got no cooperation from the Republicans at all.  We could  have very easily -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  60 percent of the people didn't want it.  60 percent of the  people didn't want it.  It was pretty clear the President basically went  around structures and pushed it through even though poll after poll showed  that people didn't want it.  </p><p> RYAN:  What structures.  It was the House and the Senate that voted on it.   All I'm saying is the Republicans fought this the entire way through.  If  we -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because their constituents didn't want it.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, they didn't even know what it was at that point.  And if they  were --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well Nancy Pelosi said let's pass it and then read it later.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  And then it gave the authority -- 1,400 times in that 2,300- page bill, it gives the authority to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services.  Why did they do that?  Because they didn't want those items in  statute; they wanted to be able to go in and manipulate the system.  </p><p> RYAN:  Marcia -- that is such a misrepresentation of the process.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, it is not a misrepresentation.</p><p> RYAN:  There's nothing that we passed over here that we don't send to  executive branch and say you have to make rules for this.  You have to -- </p><p> BLACKBURN:  1,400 times of rules -- that's one of the -- </p><p> RYAN:  It's the American healthcare system.  You guys try to simplify this  and you're doing a disservice to the American people.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  That is incorrect.</p><p> RYAN:  This is a complicated issue.  Sit at the table and be a part of the  solution.  And you guys -- </p><p> Blackburn:  And we just tried to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But the President didn't sit out at the table and try to be -- </p><p> RYAN:  He reached out to the Republicans through the entire process.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.</p><p> RYAN:  He couldn't get one Republican to sit and try to be a part of this. BARTIROMO:  You were there, did he reach out?  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, he did not.  And then Energy and Commerce Committee,  Healthcare subcommittee where we did this, of course.  We have tried to  bring forward things that will improve the delivery of health care, that  will solve the problems whether it's reimbursement with CMS, whether it's  the 1115 waiver system.  And no, were we met with open arms from those on  the White House and the administration?  Absolutely not.</p><p> RYAN:  This is the biggest rewrite of history I've ever seen in my life.   The Republicans had no interest.  They used this as a political issue from  day one.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman, there was a reason -- with all due respect --  there was a reason Donald Trump won the presidency.  The American people  were frustrated.  And they were upset by what was going on in Washington.   They were upset by the executive orders.  It probably was as much about  Barack Obama as it was about Hillary Clinton.  Do you agree with that?   That's the reason Donald Trump won?  </p><p> RYAN:  Barack Obama had a jobs' bill at the Congress for years.  He kept  trying to work with Republicans.  Look, don't take my word for it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, no, no.  His priority was health care.  He pushed health  care through.  </p><p> RYAN:  Let's provide context for the viewer.  Mitch McConnell said my sole  responsibility is to make Barack Obama a one-term president.  That was the  top Republican in the Senate.  And from that comment and the behavior of  the Republicans in the House not working with the President, not working  with Democrats saying we are going to use this opportunity that the people  have given us to shut Barack Obama down and the Democrats.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wasn't that because -- </p><p> RYAN:  They weren't part of the process.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- he kept going around them, doing executive orders.</p><p> RYAN:  He went around them -- he went around them after that.  He went  around them after that after they showed no willingness to work.  And now  all of a sudden -- now all of a sudden every Republican in America -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DUFFY:  Now we are at the state of the Union, this joint session of  Congress we see this #Resist attitude coming, so are the Democrats going  look at what they perceive the Republicans did in terms of obstructing  Obama's agenda?  And are they going to say, we are going to do it  differently, we are going reach across the aisle, we're going to help the  country move forward for sure?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about that?  What about that?</p><p> RYAN:  To be determined, I think.  Many of us including me, myself has said  from the very beginning, he's elected president, we should try to work with  him.  He did nothing in -- Maria, he campaigned on jobs, the economy, he  was going to open up the steel mills.  He was going to reopen the coal  mines and put people back to work.  Here we are, how many weeks later,  where is the trillion-dollar transportation bill? </p><p> Why would you pick -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  With all due respect it's been a month.  It's been a month.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, within a month, the Obama -- within a month we had -- we had  the stimulus bill passed.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well you were in massive recession and it was like of urgent  need.  </p><p> RYAN:  Well, people in Youngstown voted for him because they are still in a  massive recession.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The point is though tonight a number Democrats are going to be  bringing legal immigrants here.  I don't understand why the grandstanding.   Why not go to the speech with your sleeves rolled up, ready to work, and  get the people's business done? </p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's the type of attitude that we would love to see.  </p><p> RYAN:  This is a complete reversal when President Obama was in, Marcia.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BLACKBURN:  No, it is not because -- </p><p> RYAN:  It's a complete reversal.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  -- there are so many times that we have brought good-solid  ideas to the table.  There are times, remember when -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows Harry Reid got in the middle of everything and  stopped any legislation.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  That's right, 400 bills.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Everybody knows that.  </p><p> BLACKBURN:  And what we are saying is, come on, guys, there're things that  are on the table.  We need to get these done.  Let's get them to the  President's desk.</p><p> It is time to get this country moving again.  The American people voted for  us.  That is s why Donald Trump is president.  So let's bring our best  efforts to bear.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The people want you guys to work together.  You know that.</p><p> BLACKBURN:  Yes, they do.</p><p> RYAN:  You're the President, you set the tone.  Pick the issues that you  know are going to unify the country.  Pick the transportation bill,  trillion dollars, Davis-Bacon, broadband in every corner of the country.   We want to see -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And military spending -- it looks like the public wants an  increase in military spending.  That's according to the polls.</p><p> RYAN:  Well, we do.  We do -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> RYAN:  Let's do it, Marcia -- you and I should do that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be watching.</p><p> RYAN:  But I think we do need to rebuild the military. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Congressman Ryan and Congresswoman Blackburn -- thank you.</p><p> We will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We are live from our nation's capital for President Trump's  address to a joint session of Congress tonight.</p><p> It is a gorgeous sunrise behind me.  Take a look.  We are enjoying this  beautiful day here in Washington.</p><p> Meanwhile a top executive of Uber who recently joined the company from  Google has resigned. </p><p> Cheryl Casone with the details and back story there.  Cheryl -- over to  you.</p><p> CASONE:  I've got the story, not the sunrise though here in New York City  like you've got, Maria.</p><p> So Amit Singhal resigned from Uber for not disclosing a sexual harassment  charge at his former employer that was first reported by Recode.  Singhal  denies he sexually harassed anyone while he was at Google where he was the  head of Search.  Uber has been dealing with charges of discriminatory and  sexist behavior at their company.  Singhal joined Uber in January from  Google and his senior (ph) role in maps and to advise on Uber's self- driving technology.</p><p> Well, speaking of self-driving Uber cars, the \"New York Times\" reporting  those cars missed at least six red lights and that had nothing to do with  human error, as Uber first said they did.  Problems with the mapping  program is to blame on that incident.</p><p> Well, careful what you say around your kids toys.  Hackers recently exposed  the conversations of nearly a million owners of Cloud Pets.  They make  those stuffed cats, dogs or rabbits for kids that you can use to talk to  your kids with.  Well, the animals are supposed to deliver messages that  you record via an app on your phone.  Well many of those recording ended up  in the hands of hackers as did passwords and e-mails.  Security experts say  it's warning the parents that have these pets to be aware of what they're  giving their children especially if they are using Cloud Pets, by the way.</p><p> Well, SpaceX wants to send humans into deep space; the company owned by  Elon Musk already delivers cargo to the space station for NASA.  Now they  hope to begin taking tourists around the moon within two years.  SpaceX  says it has already accepted a significant deposit from two unidentified  private citizens who want to fly around the moon.  The tourist flight would  last about a week and this would come after SpaceX begins (inaudible)  taking NASA astronauts up to the International Space Station and back.</p><p> Hope they enjoy that trip.  I will be watching from the ground -- Maria.   And those are your headlines.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thank you so much-- Cheryl.  </p><p> President Trump meeting with lawmakers and business leaders to jumpstart  his number one priority, the task of repealing and replacing Obamacare.   We'll take a look at that.</p><p> Plus what else is on the President's agenda for tonight's big speech.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Well, you are the big ones.   You are the biggest of the big -- right.  That's very impressive.  Thank  you for being here.</p><p> We just had a great meeting with the governors on the horrible effects that  Obamacare has had and we are going the change it and straighten it out.   And we have a plan that's going to be, I think, fantastic.  It'll be  released fairly soon.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That was President Trump speaking during a meeting yesterday  with the CEO's of the country's largest health insurance.</p><p> Joining us right now is the former chief of staff under Bush 43 and the  president and CEO of the Business Roundtable -- Josh Bolten joining us now.   Josh -- good to see you.</p><p> JOSH BOLTEN, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE:  Good morning -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> First off, give us your expectations for the big speech tonight.  What  should President Trump be thinking in terms of what's most important as you  have seen this before being the chief of staff?  What do you think he's  going to be front and center and where he should focus?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Well, every state of the union or this is a quasi-state of the  union should give the President an opportunity to set priorities.  From the  standpoint of the business community and from the standpoint of the whole  U.S. economy, the most important thing the President can do is really get  the ball rolling on three key priorities -- tax reform, regulatory reform,  and investment in infrastructure.</p><p> There's a tremendous opportunity sitting right there for the Republican  Congress for the President.  This is the time to really get the momentum  going for those priorities.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I agree with you.  Are you comfortable with the timing  that the President has laid out because so far we are looking at tax reform  now really having a bigger impact in 2018 as opposed to this year?</p><p> We had Steven Mnuchin on this program yesterday who was very clear that we  are not going see a real plan probably until the summer time, August.  </p><p> BOLTEN:  You know, we would like to see it move as fast as possible.   Secretary Mnuchin is right that it's going to be hard to have a plan  actually implemented before 2018.  But the whole business community would  like to see tax reform done as rapidly as possible in 2017.  But they've  got a lot on their plate.  They need to work it through</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What kind of an impact do you expect tax reform to have on  economic growth?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  If it's a good tax reform and by good I mean a tax reform that  substantially lowers corporate rates to an internationally competitive  level and a tax reform that shifts us toward a territorial system of  taxation.  If it's that kind of tax reform, it'll have a huge impact on the  economy.  It's an enormous opportunity because we have kept our economy  shackled by a way outdated tax system.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not only that but shackled by an enormous amount of regulation.   So you've got this rollback of regulation happening alongside the tax  reform.  How important is that?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Huge also.  That portion is already under way.  The administration  has taken some really important steps both in terms of process and  addressing specific regulations that are tying up business unnecessarily.</p><p> We can protect our health, our safety, our environment without  unnecessarily making it so difficult for the businesses in America to  create jobs and they are on the way to doing that although that'll be  rolling out over the course of the year.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Josh -- let me ask you.  And I want to ask you about your  Business Roundtable new job as well -- congratulations on that.  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let me take you back to when you were the chief of staff, what  do you recommend the President do if he gets interrupted tonight?  If there  are people who are protesting -- we know that Rosie O'Donnell is expected  to be outside leading a protest.  We know that a lot of Democrats are  taking guests who are immigrants or trying to make a point of the  diversified country that we love.  What should President Trump do in that  regard?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Rise above.  This is the moment to be presidential.  Campaign is  over, now the country wants to come together behind one president.</p><p> You know, I think the vast majority of the country, whether they voted for  President Trump or not, want to see him succeed and now is his opportunity  to be really presidential and lead the country towards some of the  priorities that I just mentioned.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  As you take on this new role what's your priority at the  Business Roundtable?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  Tax, that is huge for the companies that are members of the BRT.   We have 200 CEOs who participate in it.  They represent some of the biggest  companies in the United States, employ 15 million people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are they happy with President Trump?  </p><p> BOLTEN:  You know, they are very excited about the opportunity that his  changes in policies might pose -- the tax reform, the regulation, the  infrastructure.  That's why you see so much bounce in the stock market and  you feel it among the members of the BRT as well.  They think there's a  great opportunity here and tonight is the opportunity for the President to  really get that ball rolling.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching that.  Josh -- we'll be watching  what you do as well at the Business Roundtable.  Thank you.</p><p> BOLTEN:  Thank you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Josh Bolten joining us there.</p><p> We've got more ahead.  The President's plan to strengthen the military.   Secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin joins me next live right here.</p><p> Back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Here again is Maria Bartiromo with special coverage of  President Trump's address to the joint of congress, live from Washington  D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  We're happy you're with us this morning.  We're  coming to you live from Washington D.C. I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Tuesday February 28th.  Your top stories right now 7:30 A.M. on the East  Coast.</p><p> President Trump will address a joint session of congress for the first time  as our commander-in-chief.  Among the issues tonight to be discussed,  defense.  The president expected to call for a massive increase in spending  to defend our country.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  This budget will be a public safety and national security budget.   Very much based on those two and plenty of other things but very strong.   It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild the  depleted military of the United States of America.</p><p> We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network is bringing you live coverage of the  president's address tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern, so stay with us right  here as we have full analysis and live coverage tonight.</p><p> Will President Trump look to the past for inspiration?  We will bring you  some of the top moments from previous president's first addresses to  congress.</p><p> Coming up this morning.  One stop to watch, today target shares are  plummeting in the free market.  The retailer missed expectations when a  reported revenue and earnings this morning.  The stock is down almost 13  percent.  We are breaking down the numbers to give you backstory on target.</p><p> And it could be a record day on Wall Street nonetheless.  Take a look at  markets here, really trading right around the flat line.  A gain today  would be a 13th record close in the row for the Dow Jones Industrial  Average which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.</p><p> In Europe meanwhile, stocks are searching for direction.  Take a look at  the European indices and you will see most of the average is lower but just  by a fraction.</p><p> And in Asia overnight, markets were mixed.  Take a look at Asian markets  where the Hong Kong Hang Seng index was the loser down three quarters of  one percent.</p><p> The headache continues this morning for Samsung.  The details as the heir  to the brand is indicted on bribery charges.</p><p> And move over TV.  The massive amount of video we are all watching on  YouTube could lead traditional in the dust.  We'll tell you about the  amazing amount of video people are watching.</p><p> Talk about a seal of approval.  The adorable hug that's going viral this  morning.  We'll bring you that.</p><p> But first, our top story this half hour keeping America safe.  President  Donald Trump will seek an additional $54 billion in spending for the  Department of Defense tonight when he makes his speech in front of  congress.</p><p> Yesterday, the commander-in-chief hinted at his plans for the military  budget before he addresses the joint session of congress tonight.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  It will include a historic increase in defense spending to rebuild  the depleted military of the United States of America at a time when most  needed.</p><p> We must ensure that our courageous servicemen and women have the tools they  need to deter war and when called upon to fight in our name, only do one  thing.  Win.  We have to win.  We have to start winning wars again.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We want to bring in Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin.   And secretary Shulkin, it is great to have you on the program this morning.</p><p> DAVID SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS:  Thank you.  It's great to be  here.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  You have so many accolades to discuss.  You're the  sole Obama appointee in this administration.  You were confirmed  unanimously.  People were saying, oh, this is an easy one.  You have been  at the Veterans Affairs, even though the president have said how bad the VA  has been.</p><p> He kept somebody who was there at the VA.  So you've got a great legacy as  you come into this job.  What do you expect to hear from the president  tonight?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, what I'd expect to hear is the strong support for making  sure that we're caring for our men and women who have served our country.   There's a commitment there and that hundred to zero both from the U.S.  congress is not so much about me.  It's really the country's commitment to  making sure that we do everything that we can to deliver on our promise to  our veterans.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Tell me one of the biggest issues and how do you fix it and  that is restoring trust and accountability at the VA.  What is your  solution to those?</p><p> SHULKIN:  I think we all know that in the wait time crisis in April 2014,  we did let the country down.  We did let our veterans down.  And it's much  easier to lose trust and it is to gain it back.  </p><p> So we are slowly gaining that trust back and we're seeing that happen as we  really begin to deliver and transform the VA to be a system that we're all  proud of once again.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Why?  Why with those wait times such a problem?  How did that  happen?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think that it was really two things.  One is it was our  lack of willingness to ask for the resources that we needed to care for our  country's veterans and we just fell behind.</p><p> Secondly, it was a culture in the VA of not willing to come forward and  talk about what was really happening to hide those long wait times.</p><p> Frankly, no system is going to be able to regain trust if it isn't  transparent and if it isn't accountable.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have said in the past, look, if a veteran wants to go to a  private medical provider, then do it.  People saw that in, wait a second,  is he for privatization?  Is he going to change something?  What's your  stance on that?</p><p> SHULKIN:  I came from the private sector.  So when I entered the Veterans  Affairs, I was hoping to trying to see whether it made sense to privatize  the VA.  And I quickly learned that the VA is a unique national resource,  that we can't simply just let veterans get all their care in the private  sector, but they'd be losing a lot of very valuable services that are  important to care for men and women.</p><p> So I believe the solution is an integration of what's really great and best  about the VA as well as what's better and best about the private sector.</p><p> Our servicemen and women deserve the very best to what about both these  systems can give them.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because you're from the private sector, you have an opinion on  private sector people running agencies.  What do you think about the fact  the president has surrounded himself with business people?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think what we need in government is more best practices  of businesses.  I think we need to take what's working in the private  sector and make sure that government can function that way.</p><p> And when government gets bloated, full regulations on red tape, it doesn't  serve people well.  So I think having this private sector people in the  government makes a lot of sense.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We've got this new Fox News poll out and it shows that voters  more faith in the military compared to other national institutions.   Ninety-six of those surveyed said that they have a great deal or some  confidence in the military.</p><p> Secretary Shulkin, last week you reportedly promised major changes.  We're  coming to the Department of Veterans Affairs.  What can our servicemen and  women expect?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, first of all, that poll makes sense to me.  When I have the  privilege of spending time with our men and women in uniform, you can't  help but feel proud.  These are courageous patriotic Americans that really  should give confidence in the country and I feel confident with them.</p><p> I think the changes that we need or to make VA accountable to essentially  be open and transparent about what's going on and to give more choice so  that people can get the very best of care wherever they need to get it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We are expecting the president tonight to propose $54 billion  increase spending on the military.  How do you feel about that?  Where do  you think the money ought to go?  Because when we talk about the military  right now, when we speak to veterans, they all tell us they need more  resources.</p><p> SHULKIN:  Yes, what I know from history and I know the president  appreciates this.  When we make a decision to send our men and women off to  protect us and to fight for our country, that's a lifetime commitment.</p><p> And so when you create the spending at the very beginning of the defense  department, you need to have that commitment all the way through for  veterans.  Because we are committed to our veterans for life.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you identify areas that you believe are absolutely needed  in terms of extra spend?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, we have projections that show what the need is going to be.   We know that our men and women coming back from almost recent conflicts or  coming back with not only physical injuries but also the invisible injuries  of war.  And sometimes, it takes additional resources to be able to make  sure that we're treating those invisible wounds.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a great point.  And that's something that I think the  president that actually has mentioned as well.</p><p> How do you convince someone who's watching you now the leader at the VA but  you're an insider and someone who says look, this is broken.  We need an  outsider to come in and fix it.  How do you convince them that no, no, no.   You know this and that's why you are the best man to lead this?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, it's not my job to convince people.  I want people to watch  our results.  We are committed to fixing this.  We know we have to do  better and we are going to do better.</p><p> I've been in government now about 18 months.  That's long enough to  understand how the system and where the problems are.  And my discussions  with the president have been that we have to make these changes quickly and  being able to know where the problems are is going to allow us to do that  as quick as we need to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Meanwhile, President Bush visited MacDill Air Force base in  Florida yesterday.  He signed copies of his new book honoring veterans.   Last night, the former commander-in-chief sat down for an interview with  Sean Hannity and talked about his interactions with military families.   Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEORGE W. BUSH, 43RD U.S. PRESIDENT:  I'm kind of a crier.  When a mom hugs  me and talks about her son, it affected me.  On the other hand, it is hard  for many people to understand.  But when you go to Walter Reed and a  soldier looks at you who's lost his legs, I'd do it again.</p><p> Or you're riding mountain bikes with these troops, some of them lost a leg  who went back into combat.  Or a mother whose son lost her life and said, I  just want you to know my son died doing what he wanted to do.  It lifts  your spirit.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction, Secretary.</p><p> SHULKIN: Well, I recently had a chance to visit with President Bush at his  library in Dallas.  And I have a great deal of respect.  I think that the  president like many of us after he spent time with the men and women that  serve our country, it impacts you.  And he truly feels the commitment to  these men and women.</p><p> And his book his paintings and his life commitment now to those men and  women now to those men and women is really inspiring to me.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  When you look at today's military, the modern military versus  what we saw just 10 years ago, how do you make a distinction?   What's  different today and what are the new realities that required a different  take?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think the big difference is that so many people that are  injured on the battlefield now survive.  And years ago these would have  been injuries that would've killed them.  So we're seeing people come back  with absolutely devastating and complex types of injuries that now we are  responsible for making sure that we provide them with the best care.</p><p> And that complexity has really changed the VA because we need to respond to  those injuries.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  How do you respond effectively?  Is it a money issue?  What is  it that you need in terms of new tools?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think it's in part a money issue, but that really isn't  the big problem.  Fortunately, this president has made the commitment to  support our veterans with the resources we need.</p><p> We also have to be changing.  We have to be looking for new and better ways  to ensure that we are managing and treating the conditions that are coming  back.  This is new territory and that's why VA, not only provides care but  does research.  Our research which is the largest dedicated to veterans is  helping us improve our care every day.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So when you hear the conversation taking place right now for  example about ObamaCare, what's your takeaway there knowing what you've  seen at the VA in terms of health care?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I think that what we know about the VA is providing a  comprehensive system of care that is providing not only physical treatment  but the psychological, social, economic treatment really is what people  need to have well-being in their life.  And I think this comprehensive  system of care has really been impactful and important for our country's  veterans.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you looking toward anything specific that you'd like to  hear from the president tonight in that regard?</p><p> SHULKIN:  Well, I speak to the president.  The president is absolutely  committed not only to a strong country and to a security, but also to  making sure that we honor our commitment.  When we asked people to serve  their country, but that is the lifetime commitment.  That the country's  prepared to follow through on.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Secretary, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p> SHULKIN:  Thank you very much.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate your time.  Secretary David Shulkin there.  Fox  Business Network is taking you live to the president's address tonight to a  joint session of congress.</p><p> It kicks off at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.  We've got analysis throughout the  program.  And \"Mornings with Maria\" will be live tomorrow morning right  here in Washington D.C. for in-depth analysis after we hear the president's  address tonight.</p><p> We'll take a short break.  We're live from Washington and we'll be right  back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The vice chairman of Samsung, four other  officials being indicted.  Cheryl Casone with the details now.  Cheryl,  over to you.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Maria.  The prosecutors in South  Korea have announced the indictment of Samsung heir and vice chairman Lee  Jae-yong and the other officials.  That happened earlier today.  He was  arrested February 17th and a move that polarized that country.  Lee's  accused of being deeply involved in a corruption scandal that led to the  impeachment of South Korea's president.  He is now charged with bribery,  embezzlement, perjury, hiding assets abroad and concealing profit gained  from criminal acts.</p><p> Another headlines this morning, YouTube users around the world are now  watching more than one billion hours of video a day.  Experts say the  number keeps going up as Google's artificial intelligence continues to  produce as recommended videos to users.</p><p> And YouTube is now threatening traditional television.  Nielsen data shows  Americans watch an average of 1.25 billion hours of live and recorded TV  shows a day.  Numbers are getting very close.</p><p> And finally this, Maria, I dare you to find a cuter picture than this one.   A feel in a Japanese who was given a plush toy seal by zoo staff.  He  simply just fell in love with the toy.  He hugs the toy.  He puts the toy  on his back for a ride.  These pictures have obviously gone viral.  The  internet is in love as well.  And this probably going to all end up on a  lot of phones.</p><p> And you know what Maria, those are the big stories from New York City.  I  give you the seal.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That is so cute, Cheryl.  Thank you so much.  </p><p> Coming up, a presidential walk down memory lane.  How President Trump's  tonight to a joint session of congress will compare to his predecessors  over the years.  That's next, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump making his first address to  congress tonight and history shows the speech could have a lasting impact.</p><p> Joining us right now is presidential historian, author of a New Book, \"Game  of Thorns,\" Doug Wead is with us.  And, Doug, it's good to have you on the  program.</p><p> DOUG WEAD, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p> How do you think the president speech will compare to those before him?</p><p> WEAD:  I think he's going to be very different.  I think he will be on  message.  So he's going to talk about the economy and make America great  and he's probably going to go what his critics will say, and his close  friends will say some as off message.</p><p> He'll probably say some a little bizarre thing.  But I've learned in  researching \"Game of Thorns,\" when he's off message, he's on message.   There's two message.  One is restore America, make it great again.  And the  second message is I no politician.  So when he deviates, he's still on  message.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And then he always adlibs.  Sometimes it gets him in trouble.   But he does always adlibs.  So one of the most emotional addresses over the  years was from Lyndon Johnson.  Sworn in just days after the assassination  of John F. Kennedy.  Watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LYNDON JOHNSON 36TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  All I have that I would have given  gladly not to be standing here today.  No words are sad enough to express  our sense of loss.  No words are strong enough to express our  determination, to continue the forward thrust of America that he began.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obviously, this was an emotional moment in time.  But explain  the emotional impact that this had on the country.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes, this was a very tough time for the country, a hurtful time for  the country.  And for Lyndon Johnson personally.  This was a devastating  moment.  He was a great man.  He was a powerful man, that dominating force  in Washington but he was now destined forever to live in the shadow of John  F. Kennedy.  This young upstart who took power.  </p><p> So personally, this was a frustrating moment for Lyndon Johnson.  But he  knew the role he was destined to play by history and he had to play it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Look, we're expecting to hear a lot about the economy tonight,  tax reform, rollback of regulation.  That was something President Reagan  brought up during his address.  Let's take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> RONALD RAEGAN, 40TH U.S. PRESIDENT:  Almost eight million Americans are out  of work.  These are people who want to be productive.  The threat of  layoffs and unemployment hangover other millions and all who work are  frustrated by their inability to keep up with inflation.  We must begin  now.  But people are watching and waiting.  They don't demand miracles.   They do expect us to act.  Let us act together.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Act together.  Your thoughts.</p><p> WEAD:  Yes.  Reagan gave one of the few joint speeches to the joint  sessions where he actually did what he said he was going to do and I expect  Donald Trump to be that kind of president.  Most of these speeches when you  study them, they'll give the speech and they do the exact opposite.  It's  uncanny.</p><p> But in this case, I think Trump like Reagan is going to do what he's  telegraphing.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can he balance, guys, this presidential demeanor, but also be  Donald Trump?</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I wanted to call out if any of the  democrats have called him or boo him.  I wanted to point to them and call  them out by name and say, who are you booing?  And then call them all their  nonsense, I would actually love to see that.  It's not presidential, but it  could be Trumpian.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And I'd like to see him say, OK, congressmen, such and such,  you're with illegal immigrant that's done terrific things in this country.   That's exactly the kind of immigrants we want.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right, exactly.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  What I'm looking at is other undertones of Andrew  Jackson.  This is what we got in the inaugural.  Steve Bannon gave -- it  was very involved in this speech.  It had a lot of America first  nationalist undertones that hearken back to Andrew Jackson.</p><p> Do you think we're going to see that in this feature?  Or are we going to  see a different kind of president?</p><p> WEAD:  Well, we're seeing it in his handling of the media because Andrew  Jackson was devastated by what the media did to his wife that killed his  wife and he hated the media, organized his own network of newspapers to  oppose them.</p><p> In \"Game of Thorns,\" I get into the media problems that Donald Trump has  and it's staggering.  The left and the right are opposed to this guy.  Much  of it has to do about China.  And I have to say this.  My name is on the  book, but the people who really gave the information to me from the book or  sources who risk their jobs, they were with Hillary Clinton for 10, 15, 20  years.  And there's some people in China who risk their lives to give this  information about the Chinese flow of money to the Clintons.  So it's a  serious issue.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It is a serious issue.  And the book is \"Game of Thorns.\"  And  we expect it's going to be a big seller.  Thank you so much Doug Wead.   We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 CQ-Roll Call, Inc.

We spend $6 trillion in  the Middle East and we have potholes all over our highways and our roads,  so we're going to take care of that infrastructure.  We're going to start  spending on infrastructure big.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network will be bringing you live coverage of the  president's address tonight at 9:00pm Eastern, stay right here on the Fox  Business Network as we take you live to that address.</p><p> As the president prepares to address congress, his cabinet is one step  closer to being complete.  The senate last night confirming Wilbur Ross his  Commerce Secretary in a 72 to 27 votes.  He'll be sworn into office this  morning.</p><p> And it could be another record day on Wall Street.  Futures indicating the  markets will open mix although we are coming off of another record high  yesterday.  The Dow closing at a record for the 12th consecutive session.   Tying the record set 30 years ago, a gain on today would be 13 record  closes in a row which has never happened in the Dow's 120 year history.  As  you see, markets are mixed right now, staying very close to the flat line.  </p><p> In Europe, stocks are searching for direction as well, take a look at the  euro zone indices right now and you'll see the FTSE, the CAC40, and the DAX  Index down fractionally across the board.  In Asia overnight, markets  mixed, take a look at the Asian indices with the Shanghai composite and the  Nikkei and the Kospi all up with the Hang Seng and Hong Kong lower a three  quarters of a percent.</p><p> Tragedy in California to report four people were killed, two others injured  after a small plane crashed into a home, the very latest on the survivor's  conditions coming up.</p><p> And Takata pleading guilty, the details behind the company's billion dollar  fine to settle its airbag scandal.</p><p>Starbucks is adding to its menu, how you can soon get your hands on the new  iced drinks just in time for spring time.

The Wall  Street Journal's Global Economics Editor, Jon Hilsenrath.  And We'll be  joined by Rachel Campos-Duffy shortly.  Good to see you everybody.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good morning to you.  Great setting.  Once again, back in  Washington as we preview the president's plans tonight.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Right.  Big increases in defense  spending, big increases in infrastructure spending, and it sounds like he's  directing his agencies to cutback spending in places like the EPA and the  state department.  All the money that's been going overseas, he wants to  keep it at home, America first, that's his message.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  But also, what does he say about the repeal and replace of  ObamaCare because, again, he conceded yesterday that the health law is  unbelievably complex according to President Trump and then also tax reform.  </p><p> I've got a little -- there's a line at the bottom of an article in the New  York Times today that might give investors pause.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is that right?  On the tax reform package.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  On the tax reform package.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We got a lot to talk about on that, that is a big story, you're  so right.  We're going to continue that this morning.</p><p> And joining us this morning and joining the conversation, Veterans Affair  Secretary, David Shulkin, this is his second secretary from the president's  cabinet to speak out.  We, of course, heard from the Treasury Secretary  yesterday, Steen Mnuchin.  And this morning, we hear from VA Secretary,  David Shulkin right here with us.  Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us.  And Tennessee  Congresswoman, Marsha Blackburn will join us.  Plus, Ohio Congressman, Tim  Ryan is going to walk through the democrat's plan.  And Former Chief of  Staff under Bush 43 and Business Rountable President and CEO, Josh Bolton,  that's a new role for Josh Bolten, I'm going to talk with him about it.</p><p> Big show ahead, so stay right there and do stay with us as we kick it off  right now with our story.  President Trump is set to outline his agenda on  healthcare, tax reform, infrastructure, and military spending.  At the  address, with joint session of congress tonight.  (inaudible) with details  right now, all the specifics at the White House.  Peter, good morning to  you.</p><p> PETER BARNES, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning Maria.  That's right,  we're getting more details on the president's speech tonight from some of  his top aides.</p><p> And as you mentioned, he will discuss a number of initiatives including  healthcare reform, infrastructure, border security and other issues.  He'll  also review the accomplishments of his first month, in particular those  executive orders and his Supreme Court nominee.  The president sat down  with Fox &amp; Friends to give us a preview of his remarks, listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  All I can do is speak from the heart and say what I want to do.  We  have a really terrific I believe healthcare plan coming out.  We have to  understand, ObamaCare has been a disaster, it's way out of control, I'll be  talking about the military, I'll be talking about the border.</p><p> And remember this, on the border and throughout our country, we're getting  the bad ones out, the bad people, gang members, drug lords, in some cases,  murders.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARNES:  Now we expect tonight that his most concrete largest initiative  will be his announcement, his call for another $54 billion in defense  spending, he will ask congress for that, a 10 percent increase his aide  say.</p><p> An administration official said however that the broad theme of the speech  will be the renewal of America and the optimistic vision for all Americans,  Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, we'll be watching that.  And, of course, we're all  focused on where the spending is going to be.  Peter Barnes, thank you at  the White House this morning.  Rachel Campos-Duffy with us this morning,  and Rachel, a Senior White House Official describing President Trump's  speech tonight as a renewal of the American spirit.</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  I think that's a great way to  describe it, everything.</p><p> This guy's going to have an audience like nobody's business tonight.  I  mean he's a showman, the inauguration was a big speech but that was at  12:00 in the afternoon, this is primetime, people want to see what he's  going to say and the democrats are making a little bit interesting with  their bringing in guests or they're going to mix it up.</p><p> I hear Meryl Streep might come, I heard she was invited, they're bringing  dreamers and all kinds of people to mix it up and I think he's got a real  opportunity to give an optimistic message and a brand new start.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's funny that they say Meryl Streep is going to attend  because the word was Rosie O'Donnell was going to be protesting outside  actually.  So that will be exciting.</p><p> But in terms of the audience, Dagen, what's your take on this because a lot  of the democrats are saying, \"Look, we want to bring someone who came here  as an immigrant, is now an American citizen but has contributed to our  country in a good way\" as a message to the president.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And what message are they trying to send?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Because, again --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You're so right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- we make the distinction between illegal immigrants that he  addresses that so many people in this country think that illegal  immigration is a problem, we're not talking about legal immigrants who have  come to this country whether it is through visas and through -- and have  gotten green cards, that's not the message.</p><p> And by the way, in his move to stop illegal immigration, he said we're not  going to touch dreamers or children who are here under the deferred action  on children under President Obama, that's number one.  And at least the  democrats are showing up which remember the dozens who do not show up to  the inauguration at least will be there.  I dare them to boo, I dare them  to boo.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  That will happen.  That will happen.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Shame on them.</p><p> HILSENRANTH:  When you talk about democrats, one of the important things we  have to think about is the president announces his plans for spending.   He's going to need some democratic support, he needs 60 votes to pass his  appropriations measures.</p><p> So he's got to find some ways to reach out at the -- if he wants to  increase military spending, wants to increase infrastructure spending and  cutback all these agencies, he's got to get some democrats on board.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I just want to quickly point out, he needs the democrats for the  replacement in ObamaCare in the senate as well.  If the repeal is easy  under the -- you can just -- you get a simple majority on the  reconciliation but it's the replacement and that becomes a huge hurdle in  the next year.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And by the way, that is why they did ObamaCare first because  they didn't want to have to deal with needing the extra votes for tax  reform.  They do that during the budget reconciliation and they feel that  it's an easier path to get that done, that's why ObamaCare's first.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You want to know the line that investors should pay attention  to?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's in the New York Times, it is the last paragraph with an  article about the healthcare law and it mentions that as Steve Mnuchin the  Treasury Secretary told you that they want tax reform, tax cuts for both  businesses and middle class Americans by in time with the August recess.</p><p> The last line says, \"Since healthcare must be addressed first, tax  legislation could easily be pushed into 2018 according to members of  congress and administration officials.\"</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's critical.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Even Mnuchin has said that August is ambitious.  So when he  sat down with us he acknowledge that it might go a little bit later.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But they still have October -- they still have the fall to  finish some of this stuff, I think that's (inaudible).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  I think the expectation based on this market run up, some of it  is just fundamental but the expectation is to gets done in this year and  not 2018.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Have you tried to take those expectations down little by  little?  There's a real nuance in terms of the way they're speaking all the  officials about this?</p><p> But look, Steven Mnuchin said very clearly that the real impact is going to  be in 2018 and I think that -- and you know really took our expectations  down first.  When we were hearing in Washington, remember Ted Cruz?   Remember Ted Cruz was the first person to say and we felt, \"Wait a minute,  we thought we were going to get tax reform right away\" but ever since then  they've been taking these expectations down.</p><p> So let's talk about the budget for a second because we're looking for a $20  billion boost in military spending, the president has also hinted at more  infrastructure spending during a meeting with governors, he said this  yesterday at the White House, watch this.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TRUMP:  We're going to make it easier for the states to invest in  infrastructure and I'm going to have a big statement tomorrow night on  infrastructure.  We spent $6 trillion in the Middle East and we have  potholes all over our highways and our roads.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  On that note, infrastructure stocks fight on Wall Street after  the commander-in-chief's announcement, let's take a look.  This is one of  the areas Jon Hilsenrath that has been leading this rally, the  infrastructure, construction aides.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  And this is an area where he might actually be able to  get some democratic buy-in because you want people on both sides, in fact,  the Obama Administration wanted the infrastructure spending too.</p><p> So -- and I think the other reason we saw infrastructure stocks reacting  yesterday is we haven't heard a lot about that, there's been a lot of talk  about repealing and replacing ObamaCare, a lot of talk about military  spending and tax cuts, we haven't heard so much about the infrastructure  piece of this and how they're going to fund it.  So the fact that he's  brining that back up again makes you think, \"All right, maybe it is on the  agenda.\"</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And on the military spending side, his proposed increase in  defense spending $54 billion, 10 percent increase, it's only $18.5 billion  above levels proposed by President Obama and it's short of what the likes  of Senator John McCain want.  </p><p> The Trump Administration is talking about a little over $600 billion,  McCain wants $640 billion.  So it's even -- so when you talk about  additional spending, they could go further.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I mean, the big question for me is how do you pay for this  stuff?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  Sure.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  It's easy to convince people to spend more money up here on  Capitol Hill but how is he going to be able to get the cuts in all these  other programs to -- that pays for it?</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And no -- questioning no changes to Medicare and Social  Security.  Those are the big kind of tsunamis waiting for the Americans.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  The obvious answer is bigger deficits.  But as he has said so  many times including this campaign, $20 trillion debt, how do you do all  this with $20 trillion?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  They're going to put the debt over the long-term and they're  going to look at it over the long-term and not look at that as a near-term  priority, obviously.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  They're going to allow --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  They've got a lot of plans, they have to do that.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  And I think they're going to think they can grow out  of this as well.  I mean you're seeing the (inaudible) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a good point.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You can't grow out of Medicare and Social Security.  You can't  grow out of the entitlement.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  No, not of Social Security, not over the entitlement but as  far as paying and also we've seen him take airplanes that costs billions of  dollars and not millions of dollars off the price.</p><p> So people are expecting him to do that and look, he's a builder.  People  want him to build and unlike the stimulus where -- I don't know what came  out of that, I can't find a road that was built from that and all the  (inaudible) jobs, this somebody who said he's going to build people's trust  that he once built, he wants to do this, he's let congress know this was a  huge priority for him and people trust him with this part of building, they  like him.  So they think he's the one to do it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll keep navigating what we're expecting tonight.   And Fox Business Network is taking you live to the president's address  tonight as he addresses a joint session of congress tonight at 9:00pm  Eastern.</p><p> Mornings with Maria will be live tomorrow morning from Washington, D.C. for  in-depth analysis as well.  We are previewing it this morning and we will  have the full announcements tomorrow with all the names you want weighing  in.  </p><p> We'll take a short break, when we come back, tragedy in California, a plane  has crashed into a home killing four people, injuring two others, the  latest on the survivor's conditions, that's coming next.</p><p> And then Takata pleading guilty, the details as the Japanese auto parts  maker agrees to pay $1 billion fine in their airbag scandal, so many  automakers getting caught up in that, we'll be right back with that.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  A small plane has crashed in Southern  California, it left four people dead.  Cheryl Casone is in New York with  the details now, Cheryl, good morning.</p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, good morning Maria from our studio  here in New York.  Well that plane crashed into two homes killing at least  four and injuring two others.  Cell phone video caught the moment of the  crash, you can see huge flames and thick smoke following an explosion.   Witnesses described a chaotic scene.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  We saw a lot of people panicking, things were going on,  we saw the back house of the neighbors are exiting, an elderly man exiting,  firefighters were taking people to safety.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Well a husband, wife, and three teenagers were on the plane, they  were flying back home to San Jose after a weekend cheerleading event at  Disneyland.  Fire official say one of the teenagers was thrown from a  backseat of the plane but remarkably the girl had only minor injuries.  The  pilot also survived this crash we should say.</p><p> Well in other news, Japanese auto parts maker, Takata is now pleading  guilty of fraud and agreeing to pay a billion dollars for concealing a  defect in millions of its airbags.  The defect has been blamed for at least  11 deaths in the U.S. alone and more than a 180 injuries worldwide.  And,  of course, the biggest recall in American auto history involving 42 million  cars and as to 69 million airbags.</p><p> Well, as investors await President Trump's address to congress tonight,  they're going to be watching earnings from Target before the bell this  morning.  The retail chain expected to post earnings of a $1.51 share on  sales of $20.74 billion and, of course. we'll get to look at the holiday  season for that company.

Ahead of the big debut, the company says it expects investors  who buy as much as a quarter of the shares to agree not to sell them for a  year.  This could be a single demand, it's pretty high for this offering  Maria.  Snap targeting evaluation between $19.5 billion and $22.3 billion  and, again, that stock is going to be listed on the New York Stock  Exchange, the ticker will be snap.</p><p> And those are your headlines from New York, Maria back to you at  Washington.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right Cheryl, thanks so much.  Let's take a short break,  when we come back, President Trump pointing fingers what he claims Obama is  behind the recent protests at town hall meetings.  </p><p> The Warren Buffett takes a big bite out of Apple, they're Berkshire  Hathaway more than doubling its stake in the technology giant, we got all  those details certainly has been a money maker for Warren Buffett this last  few months, back in a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well into the battle of the presidents now,  President Trump is blaming President Obama for the country's lack of unity,  watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  No, I think he is behind it.  I also think it's politics, that's  the way it is.  And look, I have a very different understanding --  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  But Bush wasn't going after Clinton, Clinton was going  after Bush.</p><p> TRUMP:  Well you never know what's exactly happening behind the scenes.   You know, you're probably right or possibly right but you never know.  I  think that President Obama is behind it because his people are certainly  behind it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me right now is the Former Chief Strategist for Hillary  Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, Mark Penn is with us here on set.   Mark, what do you make of this?</p><p> MARK PENN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST FOR HILLARY CLINTON:  Well I think it's so  unfortunate because I think today really Trump have to reach out to the  other side.  I mean I think that's the critical opportunity he's got with  his speech today, why throw Obama, at Obama, why divided up this early in  the morning.  Big mistake in my view.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well look, I definitely agree that there's no room for sort of  pointing fingers when we have all the big issues at hand that the president  and everyone else is trying to do but I want to be clear, in President  Obama's last speech to the country, he did say organized a few times.</p><p> If you don't like what's going on, get up and make some noise.  I mean he  did say things like that in that last speech, didn't he?</p><p> PENN:  Yes.  But look, the president's got to get democrats and republicans  applauding tonight.  If this gets so rough during the day and Obama comes  out, democrats will start boycotting, he'll get the opposite of what he was  looking for.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you've done this so many times, you have supervised six  speeches, presidential speeches.  When you say he's got to get everybody  applauding, talk about that.  How important is that and why is that so  important to get the whole room buying in right away?</p><p> PENN:  Look, the reaction of the room and the willingness of everyone to  applaud him at anything, right, is gold for him.</p><p> I remember in 1998, we didn't know whether or not the country is going to  impeach President Clinton until they stood up and applauded.  He has a  similar moment, right?  The democrats have never applauded him, he's got to  start out I think with something like the military and honoring the  military so that he gets everybody applauding and in that mode because  remember, he'll talk about infrastructure and some people will applaud,  he'll talk about taxes, he'll talk about immigration and a lot will sit on  their hands.  He needs a key moment of unity to make the speech successful  because that's what people are looking for at home.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think he's looking at it that way though?  I mean he's  so unconventional, his inaugural speech was not what most people expected,  very America first.  I mean he could come at this from a completely  different angle, didn't he?</p><p> PENN:  He could.  And I think if it gets raucous, remember, I conducted a  Harvard-Harris Poll last week, 73 percent want democrats to work with  republicans and 68 percent want Trump to work with the democrats.  So he  doesn't show that tonight then his ratings are going to start to really go  down here because they want that done.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But could it be also that if the democrats behave so badly  that it ends up just making them look bad and so maybe he doesn't feel like  he has to try to win them over rather than talk about the military you  said.  </p><p> And the more they misbehave, the more of them that gave their tickets to  code pink to interrupt and really sort of hashtag resist that it's going to  make the dems look back.</p><p> PENN:  Well, what we've seen for the first time is the republicans have a  slightly higher image in the Wall Street Journal poll than democrats.  So I  don't think the resistance strategy has been working.  So I think tonight,  the democrats will do better if they can show some unity around some key  issues and resistance around others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, I think you make a great point and this weekend on  Sunday Morning Futures, I interviewed Congressman Langevin who is bringing  with him tonight a Pakistani born doctor who is here in America, he's a  Muslim-American by the way.</p><p> He's legally here, he's done great things for this country in terms of his  work but I kept pushing back at him saying, look, there's a different  between legal and illegal, why are you grandstanding?  Why bring the guest  anyway?  Why not just go to the speech, sleeves rolled up, ready to work  and get the people's business done?  And so that's the issue, why the  grandstanding?  Just let's get to work.</p><p> PENN:  Well the balcony traditionally has been used in these speeches.   Usually the president's balcony is the most important thing that he can add  to his speech.  The democrats are doing it in reverse, they're saying,  \"Hey, what about the guys whose he's excluding?  What about the people here  who may be here illegally but are operating legally and following our laws?   What's going to them?\"  </p><p> And I think it's fair that they raise that issue but remember, look, the  business community wants to hear about infrastructure and tax cuts, they've  been waiting, if they don't hear that, there's going to be some I think  serious negative consequences.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  There have been a slew of holes out over the last few days  including the Wall Street Journal's polls which showed that the public is  for the president's policies, they have some questions about the way he's  behaving, what jumped out at you from these polls?  What did you learn  about his first couple of months in office and how the public is receiving  it?</p><p> PENN:  Well he doesn't have honeymoon ratings, on the other hand, his  ratings are no lower than Obama's or Clinton's or Bush's were during most  of the presidency.  He's in the high 40s I think in most of the polls.  </p><p> My poll came out at 48 percent job approval, he hasn't reached over to the  rest of the country but he's got a strong base, people support a good  measure of his policies, they think he will bring change in the Wall Street  Journal poll.  So he's got a lot of things working for him but the division  that he's creating, comments like the Obama thing really are creating this  division that is holding him back from being president of everybody.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But do you really think that there isn't a group of Obama  loyalists that may very well be behind the protesters?</p><p> PENN:  I think the protesters is genuine because --  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Can you say that's not real really?</p><p> PENN:  Because remember, Trump is in fact following the strategy of  dividing the country in his speeches.  Dividing the country with comments  like that.  So -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well President Obama did that (inaudible) he's pointing a lot  it's the republican's fault on every turn.  Come on.</p><p> PENN:  Look, for every action there's a reaction in politics.  So I think  the protests are real, I think the sentiment he stirred up are real.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And he's the first act community organizer president and  it's very clear that they are -- I just went to a town hall with my husband  yesterday and it was very well -- they have a pamphlet, they have a  strategy, they organized ahead of time, they eat an hour before the town  hall starts.</p><p> I mean, there's an organization behind it and that's fine, people should  come and talk to their congressmen but it's really unseemly I think to have  an ex-president really putting his weight behind that in that way.  I think  it's divisive.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We don't know exactly what the president is doing obviously,  President Obama.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  He's only a mile from the Capitol.  He's living just right  here for a reason.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  This group organizing for action, we don't know how involved  the president is in direct to the activities.  But this group that was  associated with the Obama's campaign organizing for action, the word is  that they're involved in it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And we know that Soros is involved hugely in this step.  Before  we --  </p><p> PENN:  That there's real sentiment behind these protests.  You can't  organize people who don't care about things.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Before we go, I want to get your take on Tom Perez as the  Democratic National Committee chair.  What's your take?  </p><p> PENN:  Well, look, I -- I think -- I think that it's great that -- that he  won.  I think that Democrats and a -- a lot of Jewish supporters and donors  would have real problems had he not won.  </p><p> And I think it reaffirms.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, he put Keith Ellison as his deputy, though.  </p><p> PENN:  Well, but, you know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, that's -- that's the guy that a lot of moderates didn't  want.  </p><p> PENN:  But that at least shows, look, we've got to bring the party  together.  I think they came out of that pretty well because the scare was  that -- that, in fact, the party would take such a turn to the left.  </p><p> And the answer was it didn't.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, why do you -- why do you say Jewish donors would have.</p><p> PENN:  Well, I think -- I think -- I think there was a lot of concern about  Ellison.  Haim Saban (ph), for example, said he would not, you know, if I  remember it correctly, would -- would no longer support Democrats.  I (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Because of his comments about Israel.  </p><p> PENN:  .well, because that's right.  And -- and so I think that would  really have stirred it up.  But -- but I do think they brought the party  together.  </p><p> They had to do that.  I think -- I think the Democrats are in better shape.   The question is, when are they going to get a strategy -- a legislative  strategy here that makes sense in response to -- to Trump.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and in response to what the people want.  Let's face it.   It's -- it's really economic issues that the people are hoping that the  Democrats focus on.  </p><p> Mark, great insights from you as always.  </p><p> PENN:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Penn joining us there.  we're going to  take a short break.  </p><p> When we come back, President Trump speaking to a joint session of Congress  tonight.  He's expecting to call for a substantial increase in military  spending -- what it means for your security.  </p><p> And then new drinks sprouting out (ph) at Starbucks -- the beverages coming  to the menu just in time for spring.  We'll be back in two minutes' time,  back in a moment (ph).  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.  Thanks for  being with us.  </p><p> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  We are coming here from Washington.  It is Tuesday,  February 28.  Your top stories right now at 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  </p><p> President Trump will address a joint session of Congress tonight for the  first time as commander-in-chief.  The president is expected to stress  unity during the speech.  </p><p> However, before taking the stage, the president blamed his predecessor for  tensions in the country.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  I think that President Obama is behind it because his people are  certainly behind it.  And some of the leaks possibly come from that group,  you know, some of the leaks which are really very serious leaks because  they're very bad in terms of national security.  </p><p> But I also understand that's politics.  And in terms of him being behind  things, that's politics.  </p><p> And it will probably continue.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Fox Business Network will bring you live coverage of the  president's address tonight.  That's at 9 p.m. Eastern.  </p><p> So stay with us on the Fox Business Network as we will have full analysis  and live coverage of that presidential address.  It could be another record  day in Wall Street.  </p><p> Futures are indicating the markets are flat right now.  But the lifting --  the Dow Industrial is up about 13 points.  </p><p> The Dow coming off of a record, 12th consecutive record high yesterday,  tying the record set 30 years ago.  Now, a gain today would be a 13th  record close in a row.  </p><p> That's never happened in the Dow's 120-year history.  And as you can see,  the markets are looking really fractionally moving. </p><p> But the Dow is, in fact, trading in all-time record territory.  Take a look  at European markets.  Stocks are searching for direction there with  fractional gain.  </p><p> And the DAX index is actually lower.  The others are fractionally higher.   Target revenue misses expectations.  </p><p> As you see there, we're watching earnings this morning.  And Target is  missing estimates on both earnings and revenue -- the numbers on the bottom  of your screen.  </p><p> We're going to take a look at the stock in a moment.  In Asia overnight,  meanwhile, markets were mixed.  </p><p> Take a look.  Shanghai and the Nikkei as well as the Kospi up, the Hang  Seng in Hong Kong down.  Well, at least 15 people injured in another crash  at Brazil's carnival celebration.  The details after a float collapses.  </p><p> Plus Warren Buffett taking a big bite out of Apple -- why the billionaire  investor is betting big on the technology giant.  And Starbucks is adding  to its menu -- how you can soon get your hands on the new iced drinks just  in time for spring, plus details on the company's new upscale roastery.  </p><p> Plus, Antonio Brown cashes in in the Steel City.  We are breaking down the  wide receiver's massive new contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers.  </p><p> We want to hear about that.  First, our top story, though, this half hour.   Bolstering the nation's military -- that's a top priority for President  Trump.  </p><p> The White House says that the president's first budget proposal will  include a $54 billion increase in defense spending.  Military stocks like  Lockheed Martin and Raytheon rallied on the news.  </p><p> The move will likely garner plenty of public support.  The latest fox news  poll shows that 45 percent of Americans believe the country is spending too  little on military.  </p><p> Dagen is talking about this and looking at these proposals this morning.   What are your thoughts on this budget, Dagen? </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  I think that it's a balancing act for  President Trump that he is -- he promised to increase spending on defense.   There's a 10 percent increase there, a little more than $400 billion, but  not at the levels (ph) that, say, a Senator John McCain has been calling  for. </p><p> And we should also point out that his budget director, Mick Mulvaney, has - - That (ph) Senator McCain did not like him, doesn't really like him,  because he has been a deficit hawk.  And so, I think that you're getting --  you're getting something for people who want greater military spending,  greater defense spending, but also people who worry about a $20 trillion  debt.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, but you know what, when you -- when you take a look.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  There's -- there's always the (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  .when you speak to military people, Jon, they always say that  we've got the oldest fleet in the Navy in -- in decades.  We're got the  oldest, you know, armament in the Army in decades.  I mean.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .we need upgrade, particularly as it relates to -- to  technology.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Absolutely.  And as Dagen just pointed out, there's always  been this tension in the Republican Party, between the deficit hawks and  the military hawks.  And we see it between Mulvaney -- Mulvaney and McCain.  </p><p> And I think that's something that the president is going to have to wrestle  with over the next few months as he tries to take the ideas that he's going  to be talking about tonight and turn them into -- into actual policy.  </p><p> There is tension inside the Republican Party and within his plans between  controlling all of the debt, controlling the deficit and achieving all of  these goals if he wants to set out tax reform, military spending,  infrastructure spending, and most importantly, as -- as you said earlier,  there's going to be no -- no talk tonight about doing anything on Social  Security and Medicare.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  No.  They were very clear about that.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  How do you make all of this fit together? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Which is -- which, to somebody worried about the debt and the  looming tsunami of -- so Medicare is going to go broke.  The hospital trust  fund goes broke 11 years from now.  </p><p> And we'll only be able to pay out 87 cents on the dollar in benefits.   Sixty-nine percent of our budget is mandatory spending on entitlements and  interest on the debt.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Yes.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  So more than two-thirds, they have no control over.  So when you  start talking about cutting the EPA, you're really just chipping away.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, agree (ph), I mean, that's the important point.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And that's small potatoes, right?  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  What he's going to be talking about tonight is cutting back on  the discretionary programs, a lot coming out of the State Department,  foreign aide, foreign diplomacy, America First.  But you -- you can't solve  these problems in the long run just by -- by cutting back discretionary.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, when was the last time you heard a politician come out  and say, I promised you this and now, I'm taking it back?  I mean, the --  for those people who are receiving Social Security and Medicare and  Medicaid, they don't want those programs touched.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they were promised.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, I mean, the idea -- idea is you don't do it for.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  They're taking more than they ever paid in.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .the idea is you don't it to -- you don't do it to people who  are getting it now.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But you tell people who are in their 30s.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Sure.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .and 40s, you -- you might have to expect to work a little bit  longer.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and most people understand that, right?  I mean, they  get that they -- that these programs are going broke.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They -- they like to know.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So at some point.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .more (ph) because they think they're going to get nothing  as -- if the system goes bankrupt the way it is right now.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  But they -- but.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  The younger people are not expecting.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  They're not expecting.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Younger people are not expecting.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  We talked to Jon two minutes (ph) ago, I'm not going to get  any (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  They -- that's what I'm saying.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, it's -- it's still a third rail because that no one in  this town can get it -- can get anything done on it.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's true.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And the president himself doesn't, you know, he said he  campaigned.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Even the most conservative people, when they close to retirement  age, they're like I'm getting mine.  I'm taking mine.  I have arguments  with my parents about this all the time.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Right.  I paid in (ph).  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  And I -- I tell them -- they're saying (ph) -- well, I paid, and  I said but you're taking more than you paid in.  That's why it's going  broke.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  And Mark Zuckerberg doesn't need it.  I mean, you know what  I'm saying?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  There's -- there's some ways that we can cut back on certain  incomes that people don't actually need (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And you know, I mean, a guy like -- a business guy like -- like  a Ken Lagone has been on this program and said, I don't want this Social  Security check that I get.  I don't need it. </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Don't send it to him.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So I'm just saying there are certain -- there are certain  pockets of the population that understand that this is not happening over  the long term.  And they're not expecting it.  </p><p> And yet, the leadership is afraid.  They're afraid to make that move  because that will be the political ad (ph), they took your Social Security.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  It's well (ph).</p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's the granny off the cliff ad.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's exactly.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  And we roll (ph) that.  I'm just kidding.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  But it's also real.  I was at a town hall yesterday where a  woman was in tears saying, I depend on this.  So please tell me you're not  going to cut this (ph).  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  But this is.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  So it is very real.  </p><p> Jon:  But they have a very hard time getting across the message that we're  not going to take away from you but we want to give people 10, 20, 30 years  to prepare to work a few extra months in their life.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It means you have to educate the public.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  And then but anytime they try to raise that idea, it  immediately gets translated into you're taking Social Security checks away  from older people.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  Now, last night, former President George W. Bush sat  down for interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News.  The former president  said he was frustrated when U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq.  </p><p> But he still believes ISIS can be defeated.  Listen.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> GEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Yes, it frustrated me.  And it -- I  think what people have got to realize is this bunch of thugs can be  defeated because we did so with the surge.  And we can win again.  </p><p> And so you've heard both presidents after my time say we're going to  degrade and defeat ISIS.  And I say, go get them because they can be  degraded and defeated.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You know, it's interesting because when you look back at some  of the -- the -- some of the conversation that President Bush has had as it  relates to this topic in the past, he's been very clear.  He said, if we  pull out of Iraq, this will create another problem.  </p><p> This will motivate and empower another group.  And we don't know what their  names are right now.  </p><p> This was years ago, he said this.  And now we know what happened.  ISIS was  created.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  We  -- we (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Dagen? </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Yes, and that's one of the reasons that it was reassuring to see  General Mattis go to Iraq.  He knows that.  </p><p> The civil war that if we pull out of Iraq at this point -- we -- we have to  discuss actually adding troops.  We have several thousand troops still in  Iraq.  </p><p> We have to discuss that.  That's why General Mattis was so reassuring to  see him pay that visit very early on in the Trump administration.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, Jon?  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well -- and we're -- we're seeing the Iraqis now make some  progress and in Mosul, though it's a tough battle.  We had a story in the  paper the other day about how ISIS is using drones against Iraqi forces.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, right, I saw that.  That was inside (ph).  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  If he says we're going to defeat ISIS in his speech tonight,  he's going to get a sounding -- a standing ovation.  People want him to do  this.  </p><p> And hearing George Bush.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  .say yes, we -- we've done it before -- we can do this, we  can defeat these barbarians, people want to hear that.  He'll get  bipartisan support on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And -- and Mark Penn just said, he needs to get the room on  their feet.  </p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY:  Yes.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  .and in unity.  We'll see about that.  We'll take a short  break.  When we come back, tweeting may be to blame for Oscar's biggest  mistake in history.  </p><p> We'll tell you what happened behind the scenes.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  It's true.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  It was Twitter.  And then failure to launch, fearsome (ph)  delays in Tesla's Model 3 release causing stocks to turn downward -- the  impact next, back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back to a special edition of MORNINGS WITH MARIA this  morning.  We're coming to you live from our country's capital with the  gorgeous sunrise behind us as you see there.  </p><p> We are enjoying this beautiful moment here in Washington as we preview the  president's speech tonight.  Markets are looking flat.  </p><p> But we're watching a couple of names on the move.  Target shares -- the one  to watch this morning.  That stock is plummeting in the premarket.  </p><p> The retailer missed earnings expectations.  They missed it on both revenue  and earnings this morning with their quarterly report.  </p><p> Earnings in the fourth quarter -- a dollar $0.45 a -- lower than the -- a  dollar $0.45 a share.  That was lower than the estimate which called for a  dollar $0.51 a share.  </p><p> Target shares look like this this morning, down better than 12 percent.  It  is down about 12 percent on Target.  </p><p>Tesla also a name to watch.  The stock is down following a downgrade from  Goldman Sachs.  Goldman is lowering its price target on the stock from  $1.90 to $1.85.  </p><p> And they issued a sell (ph) rating on Tesla.  That rating is centered on  concerns over the company's upcoming Model 3 sedan.  </p><p> We're watching Priceline this morning.  The company's fourth quarter  earnings topped expectations.  Priceline reported earnings of $14.21 a  share, versus the $13.01 that was expected.  </p><p> The stock is up better than 11 percent this year alone.  Meanwhile, another  accident with a float marring the carnival celebration in Rio de Janeiro.   Cheryl Casone with the details now.  </p><p> Cheryl?  </p><p> CASONE:  Yes, Maria.  So it's the second float accident in Rio this week.   This time, the top of a he float collapsed with dancers on board.  </p><p> And 11 people were injured, two of those victims said to be in serious  condition, one with head trauma.  The parade had to be stopped for almost  25 minutes so the injured could get medical attention.  </p><p> The show was allowed to go on.  Now, police are investigating the cause of  that accident.  On Sunday, you may remember, 20 people were hurt when a  float crashed into a fence.  </p><p> Well, Warren Buffett has taken a bigger share of Apple.  Buffett's  Berkshire Hathaway's stake at Apple now more than double what it was at the  start of the year.  </p><p> Berkshire now owns about 133 million shares of Apple.  At the end of last  year, that figure was 57 million.  </p><p> After the recent Apple buying spree, Berkshire Hathaway's stake now sits at  about $18 billion.  Well, Starbucks introducing two new drinks just in time  for spring.  </p><p> The Cinnamon Almond Macchiato and the Coconut Macchiato hits stores today  for at least a limited time.  Starbucks is also making another addition --  it's not to the menu, though.  </p><p> They are going to open one of the roasteries in Milan, Italy in late 2018,  marking their first store in Italy.  Starbucks plans to open nearly 30  roasteries worldwide, we should say.  </p><p> And it turns out the ratings were also a big blunder Sunday night.  The  Oscar's ratings tanked the lowest in nine years -- just 32.9 million  viewers turned in.  </p><p> That is more than a million less than last year.  And now, we're learning  more about the best picture disaster -- an Oscar first.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> JORDAN HOROWITZ, \"LA LA LAND\" PRODUCER:  There's -- there's a mistake.   \"Moonlight,\" you guys won best picture.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  \"Moonlight\" won.  This is not a joke.  </p><p> HOROWITZ:  This is not a joke.  I'm afraid they read the wrong thing.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is not a joke.  \"Moonlight\" has won best picture.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> CASONE:  So what's the Pricewaterhouse Coopers, who caused the disaster,  distracted just minutes before Brian Cullinan gave Warren Beatty the wrong  envelope, he tweeted this photo of best actress winner, Emma Stone,  backstage.  Now, the mix-up happened just three minutes later when he  handed Beatty the wrong envelope.  </p><p> Cullinan's tweets reportedly not sanctioned by the academy.  He deleted the  tweet later and all other posts that he had made during the show, Maria.  </p><p> So the story continues.  And that's it.  Back to you out in D.C.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So he was tweeting and maybe got distracted and gave the wrong  envelope.  Oops.  Yes, big oops.  </p><p> All right, thank you so much, Cheryl.  Coming up, it's a done deal.   Antonio Brown, now the highest-paid wide receiver in the NFL -- details on  his massive new contract next, back in a moment, live from Washington on a  beautiful Tuesday morning.       </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The Pittsburgh Steelers making Antonio Brown the  NFL's highest-paid wide receiver yesterday, Jared max with the details now. </p><p> Jared, good morning to you.  </p><p> JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  Antonio Brown  has caught more passes in the last four years than any receiver in NFL  history during the same time span.  </p><p> To the Pittsburgh Steelers, that's what Brown can do for you.  Now, we see  what you did for him.  </p><p> The Steelers yesterday announced that Antonio Brown, who caught 12  touchdowns and totaled 1,300 yards last season, has signed a new contract  to keep him in a Steelers uniform through 2021.  It includes a $19 million  signing bonus and Brown's four-year extension calls for $68 million,  average salary $17 million a year, $2 million more than Cincinnati's A.J.  Green.  </p><p> Former Heisman Trophy winning quarterback, Tim Tebow, got into the batter's  box for the first time yesterday at New York Mets spring training at Port  St. Lucie, Florida.  Now, 29 years old and trying to make another career in  professional baseball, Tebow showed off his strength.  </p><p> Florida Gators legend smashed nine home runs in batting practice yesterday,  impressed some baseball scouts.  Adidas, all day I dream about sand --  check this out, Adidas says it's giving away an island to any pro-football  prospect at the NFL Combine who can break the record for the fastest 40- yard dash at the Combine, which is 4.7 seconds set by Chris Johnson nine  years ago.  </p><p> But the player would have to be wearing these Adidas -- Adizero 5-Star 40  Cleats and agree to wear them for the entire upcoming season.  Now, should  a player break the record, he could wind up with his own island, Adidas  says, as soon as reasonably possible.  </p><p> Or Adidas could also just pay the athlete $1 million.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean, Jared, that's -- that's pretty incredible.  I want  to switch gears and ask you about Warren Buffett announcing yesterday that  employees have a chance to win a million dollars for a year for life.  They  only have to predict the correct Sweet 16 for the NCAA men's basketball  tournament.  </p><p> What do you think about that?  Do you think somebody will actually predict  the Sweet 16 perfectly? </p><p> MAX:  That's -- that's unlikely.  I mean, that's predicting 16 out of 16  from a field that (ph) starts with, what, 68 teams.  </p><p> But they've done this contest before Warren Buffett -- last year, Warren  Buffett had -- he gave out $50,000 to two different employees for each  guessing the most correct picks during the NCAA tournament.  And there was  also a time when he gave away money for the most consecutive picks during  the tournament.  </p><p> I love seeing these new contests that -- that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p> MAX:  .are going on in sports.  I mean, this Adidas thing and you know,  this -- it's cool stuff.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Who's going to predict the perfect Sweet 16?  Come on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  It's mathematically impossible almost.  It's literally  impossible to predict the Sweet 16.  There's no chance in a pot fiery hell  (ph).</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No wonder Buffett says you can have a million dollars.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  That's why -- that's why he's making -- that's why he's making  the offer.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  That's right, exactly.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Exactly.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  No way (ph) beyond (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, right.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  .are in his favor (ph).  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Jared, pretty -- pretty tough odds there.  Jared  Max, thank you.  You should catch Jared's sports reports on Fox News  Headlines 24/7 everyday or check him out on Sirius XM 115.  </p><p> Coming up next, hitting the breaks -- Uber seeing setbacks with the self- driving fleet after reports of traffic violations -- more on the  investigation next hour.

Malaysia has to prepare for this, not by simply signing up for trade agreements which do not give us much advantage, but instead take proactive measures to promote new areas of investment and production. We should try to take advantage of the manner in which these trade conflicts are being developed. </p><p>\"This is because the focus of the US administration is on bilateral conflicts. </p><p>We are not involved in those bilateral relations. So, there are opportunities for us,\" he told a media briefing on the UNCTAD report yesterday. </p><p>Meanwhile, Jomo said the change in international monetary policy, particularly the flow of funds into US markets due to higher interest rates, will see many EMs under a great deal of stress and become more vulnerable to financial investors. </p><p>\"This is especially true in areas where there is an asset price bubble like the property market which is financed by debt. The authorities must be prudent and perhaps be unpopular to prevent the bubble from turning into a crisis,\" he said. </p><p>Local think-tank Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs is already expecting the Malaysian real estate bubble to burst sometime next year as the property market overhang has not been resolved. </p><p>Jomo also cautioned the rise of digital monopolies and the manner in which data is used to enhance profits of big tech players globally. </p><p>\"In this situation, Malaysia has to think very carefully about appropriate policies so that we can also benefit from the further development of the digital economy. </p><p>\"We should learn from the recent European Union's restrictions on Google Inc and how they may be relevant to our situation in Malaysia, given Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad's emphasis on the Multimedia Super Corridor. </p><p>\"We cannot expect the development of the digital economy will benefit all of us,\" he said. </p><p>European antitrust regulators fined Google (EURO)4.34 billion (RM21.09 billion) in July after the US tech firm required smartphone manufacturers to preinstal Google's search and browser apps on devices using its Android operating system. Manufacturers that refused Google would not be allowed to use its Google Play online store and streaming service.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MYSRSV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MYSRSV2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TC1-0HW1-DYBF-M1X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"571\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Syed Hussain Publications Sdn Bhd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Malaysian Reserve</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21342\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 28, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics - never mind political philosophy - isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p>Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism - what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p>There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p>Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the President's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p>There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals - mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic - believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p>I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p>First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\"</p><p>This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p>Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p>Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p>Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\"</p><p>If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level.</p><p>Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p>This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p>At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer.</p><p>And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UNIONL-b0f60f6a3ea511eaba3d00163ec2aa77</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UNIONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2V-89B1-DYTR-40HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">152974</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Union Leader Corp.

I don't mean this as a criticism, just a statement of fact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One of the great things about America is that politics \u2014 never mind political philosophy \u2014 isn't a big part of most people's lives. Associating a body of ideas with the institutions (political parties) that are directly charged with putting ideas into action is a pragmatic way to cut to the chase. Paying attention to what the eggheads and theorists of the left and right want the parties to do is only worthwhile if you're especially interested in politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The challenge for conservatives these days is that the Republican Party really doesn't know what it's for, beyond defending President Trump and opposing Democrats and socialism. While the fight over impeachment sucks up all of the oxygen in public, there's a robust battle behind the scenes about what it means to be a conservative.</p><p> Some of it has spilled out into public view, usually centering on nationalism \u2014 what it means, what it requires in terms of policy, how it differs from traditional conservatism or whether it differs at all. Sens. Josh Hawley and Marco Rubio, for example, have offered thoughtful versions of \"economic nationalism,\" pitting it against libertarianism (both real and imagined).</p><p> There are many different schools of thought here, but a common theme is the idea that government should be more interventionist in the economy: Policymakers should be more willing to overrule the marketplace on everything from big tech to child care to trade.</p><p> Republicans were outraged by the way the Obama administration \"picked winners and losers\" in the economy. Some were appalled when Obama bailed out automakers with a massive handout. Trump has now given more aid to farmers than Obama ever gave Detroit, and if an elected Republican has complained about it, I missed it. In fairness, the farmer bailouts were necessitated by the president's trade wars. But that just demonstrates Republicans' willingness to substitute their judgment for the market's.</p><p> There's a cultural version of the nationalist project as well. Some conservative intellectuals \u2014 mostly, but not exclusively, Catholic \u2014 believe the state has a role in imposing its judgment in the marketplace of ideas.</p><p> I have strong views about all of this, but I thought it might be helpful to offer a few humble suggestions about how to think about such things as these debates heat up.</p><p> First, the root of conservatism is conservation. The great conservative philosopher Roger Scruton, who died earlier this month, said, \"Conservatism starts from a sentiment that all mature people can readily share: the sentiment that good things are easily destroyed, but not easily created.\" This sentiment is at the heart of traditional conservatism, but it's not constrained by ideology or partisanship. Many liberals (and even some socialists) have displayed this temperament.</p><p> Second, with the great divide in conservative theory, there are those who are anti-left and those who are anti-state. For a crude illustration, some people are opposed to public schools because they don't think education is a proper task for the state. (Milton Friedman called them \"government schools.\") Others on the right think public schools are fine; they just object to how progressives operate them, filling kids' heads with objectionable ideas.</p><p> Obviously, most libertarian purists are in the anti-state camp, but for most conservatives it's a balancing act. A consistent conservative can be libertarian on nearly all policy questions and still favor heavily regulating or even banning pornography.</p><p> Another fault line revolves around the question, \"Which state are we talking about?\"</p><p> If I may show my cards a bit, outside of foreign policy, I'm very libertarian at the national level, mostly libertarian at the state level and pretty communitarian at the local level. Letting people live the way they want to live where they actually live, so long as basic civil rights are respected, has always struck me as the best way to maximize happiness and democratic accountability.</p><p> This raises a final question: Can the state actually do what you want it to do?</p><p> At the core of the conservative critique of the left has always been a basic skepticism that top-down planning from Washington can work. It used to be that the champions of such planning were mostly on the left. That's not true any longer. And it remains to be seen whether top-down planning from the right works any better than it does from the left.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-34b8fd09a7a89a69815a5502156d5ae4a8c7b17</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898F0100585DE NWBKGA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2N-SXX1-DXVP-V4GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"766\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Marietta Daily Journal<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life. I agree. But while proposals for a Code of Conduct are welcome, they need to go further than just asking that fact checking services, promotion of authoritative news sources or making content less visible. We need the regulator to be sanctioning platforms that allow anti-vax propaganda to spread unchecked. I'm also calling on the NHS to promote messages outlining the importance of vaccinations on social media and the high risks of ignoring such advice. </p><p>Vaccinations have been one of the most important public health interventions of the last 70 years since the creation of the NHS. We can't allow fake news and pernicious propaganda to undermine a medical advance that has helped save so many lives. This is about the health and wellbeing of our children. It would be shameful tragedy if we failed them by not acting. </p><p>Jon Ashworth is Labour and Co-operative MP for Leicester South. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVM-8011-JD3S-J02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life. I agree. But while proposals for a Code of Conduct are welcome, they need to go further than just asking that fact checking services, promotion of authoritative news sources or making content less visible. We need the regulator to be sanctioning platforms that allow anti-vax propaganda to spread unchecked. I'm also calling on the NHS to promote messages outlining the importance of vaccinations on social media and the high risks of ignoring such advice. </p><p>Vaccinations have been one of the most important public health interventions of the last 70 years since the creation of the NHS. We can't allow fake news and pernicious propaganda to undermine a medical advance that has helped save so many lives. This is about the health and wellbeing of our children. It would be shameful tragedy if we failed them by not acting. </p><p>Jon Ashworth is Labour and Co-operative MP for Leicester South. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVK-3V21-JD3S-J4MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life.

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life. I agree. But while proposals for a Code of Conduct are welcome, they need to go further than just asking that fact checking services, promotion of authoritative news sources or making content less visible. We need the regulator to be sanctioning platforms that allow anti-vax propaganda to spread unchecked. I'm also calling on the NHS to promote messages outlining the importance of vaccinations on social media and the high risks of ignoring such advice. </p><p>Vaccinations have been one of the most important public health interventions of the last 70 years since the creation of the NHS. We can't allow fake news and pernicious propaganda to undermine a medical advance that has helped save so many lives. This is about the health and wellbeing of our children. It would be shameful tragedy if we failed them by not acting. </p><p>Jon Ashworth is Labour and Co-operative MP for Leicester South. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVB-52N1-F0JV-80HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life. I agree. But while proposals for a Code of Conduct are welcome, they need to go further than just asking that fact checking services, promotion of authoritative news sources or making content less visible. We need the regulator to be sanctioning platforms that allow anti-vax propaganda to spread unchecked. I'm also calling on the NHS to promote messages outlining the importance of vaccinations on social media and the high risks of ignoring such advice. </p><p>Vaccinations have been one of the most important public health interventions of the last 70 years since the creation of the NHS. We can't allow fake news and pernicious propaganda to undermine a medical advance that has helped save so many lives. This is about the health and wellbeing of our children. It would be shameful tragedy if we failed them by not acting. </p><p>Jon Ashworth is Labour and Co-operative MP for Leicester South. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVT-2Y01-JD3S-J0PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Parents ignoring the directive and insisting on sending their children to school have been warned they face fines of $500 or 6 months in jail. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An outbreak of 153 cases of measles since October prompted Rockland county to take such action. While Rocklands' response may be drastic, they aren't the only community in the USA grappling with outbreaks at a time when the anti-vaccination movement is growing in strength and prominence online. Indeed, the US is set to see the most measles cases this year since 2000 when theoretically the disease was considered officially eliminated. </p><p>Europe is literally not immune either. Measles cases are at a 20-year high and 72 children and vulnerable adults lost their life to it last year. In 2019 so far, Romania has seen 261 new cases of Measles. In Italy, which saw 165 new cases in January, the authorities have started telling children not to turn up to school unless they can prove they have been properly vaccinated. Just across the channel in France, 124 cases were confirmed during the same period. </p><p>In the UK we have a proud history of confronting the disease. Last year marked 50 years since the introduction of the first measles containing vaccine into the UK childhood immunisation programme. It's undoubtedly been a huge public health success - thanks to this vaccine, it is estimated that 20 million measles cases and 4,500 deaths have been averted since 1968 in the UK. It will have helped millions of people avoid visiting their GP and thousands avoid hospital admissions, as well as freeing up NHS resources. </p><p>But there are warning signs we must heed. </p><p>After years of cuts to public health budgets, falling numbers of Health Visitors supporting parents and increased pressures on general practice with less GPs and district nurses, our childhood vaccination rates are the lowest in over a decade, with the number of two-year olds getting the MMR vaccine falling for the fourth year in a row. Whooping cough is up on the up again in England and just a few weeks ago, a measles warning was issued in Greater Manchester. </p><p>I would hate to see anything as drastic as the measures taken in Rockland County or Italy happen here so decisive action from government must become an urgent priority. </p><p>That means investing more in primary care and abandoning the swingeing cuts to public health budgets the Health Secretary had just endorsed. </p><p>Bit it means taking firmer action with the big tech social media companies too. </p><p>The dangerous anti vaccination movement can too easily spread its propaganda online with no counter argument or concerns raised. For example The Royal Society of Public Health found that half of all parents with small children have been exposed to misinformation about vaccines on social media. </p><p>In just a few hours I was easily able to find shocking anti vaccination content on social media in Facebook groups containing posts from terrified parents asking for advice on how to make sure their new born babies aren't taken away from them shortly after birth to be vaccinated. Or other posts completely misinforming the public about the science behind vaccinations. </p><p>One post I saw, for example, cited the use of formaldehyde in vaccinations, using this as a scare tactic, despite the fact that we know that formaldehyde is found naturally in many living things and you'll find around 50 times more formaldehyde in a pear, than what is in any vaccine. </p><p>A large proportion of anti-vaccine messages found on these sites appear to originate in the US, but of course the spread of information nowadays is global and UK based groups on Facebook do exist, with some pages I've found having thousands of members. </p><p>No wonder the government's chief medical advisor,Professor Dame Sally Davies, has said MMR vaccine uptake was \"not good enough\" and has urged parents to ignore \"social media fake news\". </p><p>The spread of this 'anti vax disinformation' on social media is pernicious and potentially fuels a public health crisis in the UK </p><p>Today's online harms white paper cites the spread of inaccurate anti vaccination messaging on social media as a risk to public health and a threat to our way of life. I agree. But while proposals for a Code of Conduct are welcome, they need to go further than just asking that fact checking services, promotion of authoritative news sources or making content less visible. We need the regulator to be sanctioning platforms that allow anti-vax propaganda to spread unchecked. I'm also calling on the NHS to promote messages outlining the importance of vaccinations on social media and the high risks of ignoring such advice. </p><p>Vaccinations have been one of the most important public health interventions of the last 70 years since the creation of the NHS. We can't allow fake news and pernicious propaganda to undermine a medical advance that has helped save so many lives. This is about the health and wellbeing of our children. It would be shameful tragedy if we failed them by not acting. </p><p>Jon Ashworth is Labour and Co-operative MP for Leicester South. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PLHCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PLHCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VVD-4691-JD3S-J40C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><timeReceived>6:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Dods Parliamentary Communications Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politics Home (Online)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 9, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

When I talk to David Wilson, it's like miss, miss, miss, beat, miss, miss, beat. It seems to be more misses than beats. Am I right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  No, you're not. If you look at this earnings season, what you've had is some really huge headline misses. You've had some big tech companies like Microsoft and the like, but if you look 75 percent plus of companies are surprising the -- I think the median beat is something like seven percent.  </p><p>      So it was a -- from a growth perspective, this was a soft earnings season. But companies did much better than expected.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  So then how do you model forward? I mean a lot of headlines out. We're now red on the S&amp;P 500 for the year, woe is me, malaise. You're an enthusiastic guy. Temper or gauge now your bullishness into the end of the year.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  So I'll start with what Wall Street is expecting, so what all these analysts are cumulatively expecting, which is something in the ballpark of a flat earnings year over year in the second quarter, up maybe three or four percent in the third, and maybe six or seven percent in the fourth. So what we're expecting is not gang buster earnings growth, but improving earnings growth.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Okay, but then what supports -- forget about whether you want to acquire shares Monday or not -- what supports equity besides Fed policy? Is it use of cash? Free cash flow, is that what's going to get it done?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well, I think that something that is really under estimated -- what you have is right now is companies in an environment where economic growth is really weak are returning more capital to shareholders. If you take -- buyback some dividends, the amount that companies take up their earnings and give it back to the marketplace, stocks are yielding 4.7 percent.  </p><p>      Now, a ten year bond is yielding -- what is it -- 1.85 percent right now. So stocks relative to anything else are very attractive.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Let's walk through this now. If you have a dividend of two percent, three percent in the United States, higher dividends in Europe I get, and then you overlay on top of that the \"dividend\" from share buybacks and from dividend growth, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  And that gets you up near five percent blended throughout, including ugly oil.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  That's correct. And if you look at -- you know, our guess is that once oil prices recover that 4.7 percent yield can go as high as the low fives. It's much higher than it is in Europe. Europe has much higher dividends, but they don't buy back their shares. So they pay everything out of dividends. So U.S. companies are returning much more capital back to the market.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Peter Tague was with us with Citigroup earlier this morning and he talks about the idea of more stock for stock transactions. The currency of M&amp;A seems to be changing. How does that roll into the stock market if every stock out there is richly priced and uses currency?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  But I don't see the stock market as being particularly rich in the pricing. Right now, the multiple on stocks is 17. Historically, on average, it has been 14. But Tom, you and I know that the range has gone from 6 to 24, so we are a little above average. Stocks are not crazy priced.  </p><p>      And I think you hit the point. Cash flow back to shareholders and how attractive that is compared to other alternatives is the only way that you should be looking at the value of the stock today.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Has there been a sea-change in thinking in corporate suites? When you look at the MD&amp;A, the management, discussion and analysis in an annual report, to me there has been a permanent psychological change in use of cash in corporate America. Do you fold that into your research?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  One hundred percent. So right now, for example, companies, of the dollar they're earning, they're returning over 90 percent of that as basically free cash flow that can go back to shareholders. If you go back 15, 20 years ago, that was about 70 percent.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  So they are much more shareholder focused.  </p><p>      And the other thing, which is a big change, executives fully realize (inaudible) is that we are in a slow growing world. It's the world we live in. And they are managing their businesses for that. So they are using less capital holding, less inventory, being tighter about their use of capital. So they are really managing optimally for this kind of environment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  John Golub with us, RBC Capital Markets. Dean Maki to join us here in a bit.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  I look, John Golub, at the idea of the du jour which is dividend growth and consumer stocks priced to perfection. Let's start with the idea I got smart, I owned a consumer stock. It's up, up, up. How do I hold it right now? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  First of all, what is a consumer stock? So if you look at let's say the Nordstrom's and the Macy's, those traditional...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Oh, come on. They're not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  But those companies are I think in a much more difficult, competitive situation. If you look at consumer staples, the stuff that we use every day that is not under the same kind of pressure, they generate tremendous free cash flow back to shareholders.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But, come on, 3M is not a consumer stock, but I use scotch tape every day, or the house does. I mean I'm using it within a broad sense. Many of these stocks are priced to perfection within this gloom.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Again, I think if you look at even some of these companies that may be trading in the high teens in terms of PEs, if you look at what the cash flow that they're generating, the way that they're managing their businesses, and the value that interest rates are low and the alternatives for growth are weak, I think those companies are worth every penny.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, but the critical message here is the media is as guilty of this as anyone. We quote the cash dividend. Pros like you don't do that. You quote in your head cash dividend, plus buyback, etc.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  And the reason is that U.S. companies have a certain amount of cash and they can do a whole variety of things with it. They can retire their debt. They can invest it for the future. And when growth prospects are weak, they're going to give it back.  </p><p>      But economically, whether they're doing that in a buyback or doing that in a dividend, it really is the same thing because, if it's a buyback, it moves your stock price up, if it's a dividend, you get the extra cash out. But either way, it is return that you're getting as somebody who holds the stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Are the financials attractive here? We get real mixed results.  </p><p>      I mean we've got sell side saying maybe not now, but there is a huge glory moment a year out, two years out, three years out for the big banks. Do you agree?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  I think as long as interest rates stay anywhere in the ballpark of where they are right now, very, very difficult to invest in. Right now, the banks have become a big bet on interest rates rather than a bet on their business models.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  On their strategic models and such. Do you look for (inaudible) there? That's a classic American question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Yes, I don't think you can. Among the big banks, I don't think there is the -- I don't think the regulators can allow for major mergers. So you may have smaller banks squeezing together for some efficiency, so either you're going to have higher interest rates or banks are going to be a bad investment.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right. What do you recommend?  </p><p>      You work within the institutional space for the most part, but what do you recommend for the idea of someone with a 401(k) or retirement plan? Their heads are spinning.  </p><p>      By definition, they feel behind, even they are not actuarially behind. How do you find \"growthiness\" that helps you catch up? That's tough now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Yes, we've been talking about this idea of stable growth. So there's like these mega growers, the Facebooks and the Googles that are delivering massive growth.  </p><p>      But then there are companies that are in more boring areas like Cintas that supplies uniforms, or Waste Management that hauls your trash. And they grow at a much lower rate, but they're stable. They're visible. You can see it. And in a world where there is so much uncertainty, investors are willing to pay more for those kinds of names than they have in the past.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. Okay, 15 seconds, can you buy that PE multiple 23 consumer stock today? Forget about holding it. Can you acquire shares at that level?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  I think you can, and I will tell that institutional investors are really struggling with it and I think they should be buying it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  But institutional investors have all their radar up, right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  They are totally uncomfortable. And that may be the reason...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  You look like the Draper guy in \"Mad Men\" today. I mean it's really back to Nifty '50, isn't it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  I think it is. I think we will be back to Nifty '50, Tom.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. John Golub with us with RBC Capital Markets. We'll continue this conversation on the equity markets and we'll strap it across the American economy, and then we'll move to Dean Maki of Point72 as well.  </p><p>      (BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  I'm Michael McKee, along with Tom Keene and Jonathan Golub from RBC Capital Markets. Tom, we've got to put Jonathan on the record and get him to make a forecast here of Penguins-Lightning, but we'll do that before he leaves.  </p><p>      I want to go to the Fed a little bit and pose a question to you that is actually being posed this morning by Nick Colas at Convergex, our friend over there, who says how high does the VIX need to go for the next three weeks before the Fed takes a June rate increase off the table?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  That's actually a really sophisticated question given what the vol has been doing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  In other words, do you think that the markets are going to be extraordinarily volatile around any kind of Fed meeting and lead the Fed by the nose to some sort of conclusion one way or another?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  I'm looking at something a little bit different, which is I think it's about the dollar and oil. What happened over the -- you know, really since mid-February, which has brought the market up and taken all attention away is that the when the Fed started to walk away from June as a potential date for a move, the dollar fell and oil prices skyrocketed. And you can just chart them like a single line.  </p><p>      And so I think that if the dollar starts to strengthen and oil falls apart, I think the Fed is absolutely out. Other than that, the data is perfect.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  Well, when you say the dollar strengthens, what do you mean? I mean how strong does it have to get?  </p><p>      Right now, we're nowhere near where it peaked earlier in the year. And as Bill Dudley said yesterday, isn't that the point?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  You know, if you look at the big things that have happened recently, the expectations for the industrial sector and for anything which is more global trade oriented in terms of S&amp;P 500 stocks, those companies have taken off like a rocket and the expectations for their earnings are up huge.  </p><p>      The energy sector is -- you know, oil prices have kind of recovered, and it takes tremendous pressure off of the banking sector and the whole -- all the capital markets. The risk in the whole market falls down.  </p><p>      That whole set of issues is really what I think the Fed should be or will need to be looking at. If the market thinks they're going to move in June and is willing to swallow it and not get concerned that oil prices are going to roll over again...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  ... (inaudible) starts to roll over, then you're fine.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Okay, but you worked with one of the guys doing the best work on wage dynamics, Mr. Porcelli. I agree with everything you're saying about oil and dollar, and the correlations, and all that, and how it comes into Fed policy. And DXY, folks, as I showed Monday or Tuesday, is just back into the strong dollar range, nowhere near new dollar record strength.  </p><p>      But Porcelli is looking at the wage growth dynamic. When you read his work, what do you see?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  What do we see? We see five percent unemployment, and job growth is strong enough that that number is -- you were talking about Dean Maki before expecting that unemployment rate to fall into the mid-fours or lower.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  You have inflation right now, if you look at the data that just came out this week. You have core CPI running over two percent. And wages are running ahead of core CPI.  </p><p>      The economic data tells you...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  That Bill Dudley is right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  The Fed -- the Fed should have moved a long time ago and interest rates would be -- I don't know -- 100 basis points higher than it is today.  </p><p>      But what they're really nervous about is disrupting not just the market, but disrupting the economy. And mind you, we're having -- so I think that's their concern. But if you made Tom Porcelli the head of the Fed, or most economists on Wall Street, I think they would tell me that is still true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Mike, that's a scary -- do you think Mr. Trump would go for that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  Don't even -- don't even -- let me rip up the script and change gears from that direction here and point out that what you would expect and what happened on Wednesday afternoon was that financials gained when the idea of a June move came on, and utilities got hammered.  </p><p>      But yesterday, that reversed. I mean shouldn't that hold? Shouldn't we see -- who is going to -- in a June scenario, who does well?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Oh, in a June scenario, the banks are the single big winner. And the utilities, and the telcos, and the REITs are the single big loser. And the rest of the market incrementally companies that are a little bit more cyclical might weaken up a little bit like big industrial companies.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MCKEE</emphasis>:  But the whole thing was -- I mean we probably did ask you, but I was going to say if we asked you right before the Fed met in December, you would have said the financials because they're raising rates. But that didn't happen. The financials had a terrible quarter and went down.  </p><p>      Is it that are rates so low now that it really -- you know, a little move isn't going to make a big difference in the financials?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Well, no, I think it's the opposite. The lower interest rates are, the more that the financials become sensitive to being pulled out by high rates.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  So if we were looking -- if the ten year bond yield right now was three percent or four percent, I'll tell you right now nobody would care. You know, the banks won't care that much.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KEENE</emphasis>:  Yes, you've been wonderful this morning talking about 20 multiple stocks and all that, up we go, the dynamics. Can you buy a PE of 10.52, a yield of 2.4 percent, three year dividend growth of 11 percent per year? They sell iPhones. I mean Apple is extraordinary on the Bloomberg screen that I see in terms of valuation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GOLUB</emphasis>:  Now, you know, on the surface the answer is absolutely yes. On the other hand, what the story is over there is negative earnings growth right now, and that trend is probably going to continue to be weak because they've saturated the market and their margins are high.  </p><p>      But this is not a new story. Investors -- there is a reason why Apple never got the math of -- not in the last years, they got the math multiple, because the market kind of knew that there was just so many phones that you were going to use.

George Sorial, a former top executive with the Trump Organization, is offering insight into the president's family business in a new book called \"The Real Deal: My Decade Fighting Battles and Winning Wars With Trump.\" Congress is holding hearings into anticompetitive behavior among the tech giants and it comes as Facebook debuts a new blood donations feature designed to make it easier to know where to donate.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[07:30:01] JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: When America was attacked, they ran into burning buildings as people ran away from them. And now, 9/11 first responders, they need help and Congress is failing to answer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The September 11th Victim Compensation Fund that provides health care to those American heroes is set to expire next year if Congress continues to punt on the bill.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comedian Jon Stewart went to Capitol Hill to address lawmakers and their failure to act. This was dramatic -- watch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS ADVOCATE, FORMER LATE-NIGHT HOST: Behind me, a filled room of 9/11 first responders. And in front of me, a nearly-empty Congress. Sick and dying, they brought themselves down here to speak to no one. It's shameful. It's an embarrassment to the country and it is a stain on this institution.</p><p>There is not a person here -- there is not an empty chair on that stage that didn't tweet out never forget the heroes of 9/11. Never forget their bravery. Never forget what they did -- what they gave to this country.</p><p>Well, here they are. Your indifference cost these men and women their most valuable commodity, time. It's the one thing they're running out of.</p><p>They did their jobs with courage, grace, tenacity, humility. Eighteen years later, do yours.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BERMAN: Wow.</p><p>Joining us now, John Feal and Brian McGuire. Both were 9/11 responders who accompanied Jon Stewart yesterday.</p><p>John was a construction supervisor who assisted at ground zero and had part of his left foot amputated after a steel beam fell on it. And, Brian was a New York City firefighter for 14 years before a diminished lung capacity from the toxins he breathed at ground zero forced him into retirement in 2013.</p><p>Gentlemen, thank you for being with us. Thank you for what you did for this city. We certainly honor you every chance we get.</p><p>And, Brian, I just want to start with you. What was it like to be in that room while Jon Stewart was delivering that impassioned plea on your behalf?</p><p>BRIAN MCGUIRE, RETIRED FROM 9/11-RELATED ILLNESS, FDNY 1999-2013: Thank you for having us. I appreciate the time.</p><p>Being in that room yesterday, heartbreaking. Not for me, not for the guy who was sitting to the left or right or me, but for the people who were speaking yesterday.</p><p>For example, Det. Lu Alvarez, who was having his 69th cancer chemo treatment today, begging for Congress to help us before we pass away.</p><p>I was honored to be in that room yesterday and listen to those testimonies of the first responders of the widow of the students yesterday who were all suffering worse than we are today.</p><p>BERMAN: What is the cost to Lu -- to you, Brian, to bring yourself to Washington to have to beg for this money?</p><p>MCGUIRE: We're fighting for those who can't be heard to voice their own help and their cause because they are too sick and they are dying.</p><p>Just last week alone, we had a rough week of 9/11 first responders. We had seven first responders and recovery workers die due to 9/11 cancer. We are here trying to help those families to bring some closure.</p><p>BERMAN: So, John, again, we all listened to Jon Stewart yesterday. He has been such a forceful advocate for this cause and I know you guys are all very close to him and thank him.</p><p>You also have some insight as to how Jon Stewart got to this point yesterday. Take us behind the scenes from before the hearing, John.</p><p>JOHN FEAL, 9/11 RESPONDER, FOUNDER, THE FEALGOOD FOUNDATION: Well, again, John, thanks for having me. Big fan -- watch you guys every morning, so humbled.</p><p>You know, listen, Jon's a dear friend of mine and inside the 9/11 community and outside of the 9/11 community, Jon and I do a lot of work together.</p><p>And over the last several days, Jon was floundering with his speech and Jon Stewart doesn't flounder -- trust me. And I said Jon, do it from the heart. But, Jon had a prepared statement.</p><p>But I also knew that Ray Fifo (ph), who was a dear friend of mine and Brian's, and Jon, who passed away two years ago, was so dear to Jon. When his name was brought up, Jon would cry. [07:35:00] And, Ray's golf outing was the other day and there was a jacket that was being auctioned, and I outbid everybody for that jacket. I made sure I got down to D.C. before Jon arrived and I had my team of 40 people sign it.</p><p>And then, before Jon got to D.C., me and Jon met outside the Hill and we had our 15 minutes of intimacy where we -- and I gave Jon a handwritten letter to get him started on that emotional journey because I know how Jon ticks. I know what the 9/11 community means to this man.</p><p>And I knew he would be an emotional wreck by the time he got to the guys with the jacket. And when he got there, they gave him this jacket. And to see him genuinely cry, I knew that Jon Stewart was going to be in rare form.</p><p>And after that when we got into the hearing, Jon was looking at the speech and then I whispered in his ear from behind -- I was sitting behind him. I said, \"Jon, did you notice that there aren't many members of Congress in this committee room today?\" And I said, \"Can you see this one? He's falling asleep.\" And I said, \"Do you see this one? He's on his cell phone.\"</p><p>I said it's disrespectful to those who came down here with cancers that we're sitting here and they're not taking this serious enough.</p><p>And listen, Jerry Nadler does a great job. I love Jerry Nadler.</p><p>But, you know, I've been doing this longer than anybody and I know when I see people that are in -- they're just not sincere and I didn't -- I didn't sense that yesterday.</p><p>And I think by that time, Jon Stewart had enough and Jon Stewart did what he did best. Jon Stewart articulated our pain and suffering and our agony over the last 18 years.</p><p>And, Jon painted a picture for America to see. He painted a landscape to let America know that over 95,000 who were in the World Trade Center health program that are being treated across our great nation are being forgotten by our federal government -- by Congress, a dysfunctional body of work who continues to fail us.</p><p>You know, we have battled these people now for over 15 years. These are the same people that promised to fix yesterday's problems today, maybe tomorrow, and we're tired of it. We don't got to put up with it anymore.</p><p>They're Congress. They work for us. Anybody who has an issue in America should go to the House that we own, whether it's the Senate or the Congress, and demand that these members work for you. We voted them in, our taxpayers -- we pay their salaries. They work for us.</p><p>That's my approach and that's why after 278 trips to D.C. I have zero tolerance for any member of Congress or the Senate. And I hope they don't like me. I don't want them to like me. BERMAN: Again, I could listen to you talk forever. And, you know, you give Jon Stewart so much praise, but I am sure he would say that you two and the others that he is helping are the ones who have sacrificed so much and are the ones who have done all the truly important work.</p><p>John, just quickly, when you looked at that stage and you saw the empty seats, and when you saw, as you say, someone closing their eyes there, how did that make you feel?</p><p>FEAL: Not shocked. This is -- this -- yes, we take our work seriously.</p><p>We got in our cars, drove down 95, sat in traffic. Many had to get out and take their medication or re-change an oxygen tank or get in a wheelchair just so they can get to the rest stop. Get back in, get back onto the road, get into D.C. We take everything we do serious.</p><p>You know, everybody that I bring to D.C., they're not on vacation. They're there to advocate for the tens of thousands of people that can't be there.</p><p>So, while we're taking something serious and if Congress does not sense our urgency and doesn't feel how serious we're taking this, well then, yes, they're going to get blasted by somebody like Jon Stewart. Kudos to Jon Stewart.</p><p>You know what? We would not be talking right now if Jon Stewart read a prepared statement yesterday. John would have read from a piece of paper like everybody else and everybody else who testified did a great job.</p><p>BERMAN: They did.</p><p>FEAL: Let me tell you something. I'm not a crier -- I don't cry. And yesterday, I think America got to see me cry a lot. And I don't cry well because I'm pretty ugly on camera --</p><p>BERMAN: Well --</p><p>FEAL: And --</p><p>BERMAN: You're a very handsome man.</p><p>FEAL: -- there was ugly crying for me and it was real.</p><p>BERMAN: You're a very handsome man, John. You are a very handsome man.</p><p>FEAL: No, but --</p><p>BERMAN: Listen --</p><p>FEAL: -- that was -- that was -- that was some serious --</p><p>But, you know, listen, Luis Alvarez is a dear friend of mine -- BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>FEAL: -- and Luis is going to die in the near future and I have to go to another wake. I've been to over 180 of these funerals. This is painful, this is sad.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>FEAL: And I'm tired of listening to excuses of why these men and women, uniform and non-uniform, especially the children of Lower Manhattan -- there were 12 schools in the geographic map --</p><p>BERMAN: Can I ask you John, what's the holdup? What's the holdup? Who is -- who is standing in the way of you getting this money right now as far as you're concerned?</p><p>[07:40:00] FEAL: Well, history will show you in 2010 and 2015 it was Republican leadership. We just went to through the House. We have over 300 cosponsors.</p><p>Kudos to my teams that made 12 trips and had about 400 meetings in the last six months. We've kicked butt. But now, we're going to go into the Senate where bills go to die because it's run by a bunch of cranky old white men who are trying to keep control of this country.</p><p>So, I mean, Mitch McConnell, we're on our way. Lindsey Graham, we're on our way.</p><p>You know who we are. We met with you before. We're just not going to take your crap this time.</p><p>BERMAN: John --</p><p>FEAL: It's that simple.</p><p>BERMAN: John Feal, Brian McGuire, thank you.</p><p>Again, thank you for what you've already done. Thank you for what you're doing. Let us know how we can help.</p><p>FEAL: No, thank you for telling our story because without you telling our story this remains a New York issue.</p><p>There's 433 out of 435 congressional districts in this country that sent somebody to ground zero, the Pentagon or Shanksville that are affected by 9/11. And there are 12,000 people now with a certified cancer that NIOSH -- the federal government said yes, 9/11 caused your cancer.</p><p>So, thank you CNN because you guys took this yesterday and ran it all night. And now, you're doing it again today. So, thank you.</p><p>BERMAN: Well --</p><p>MCGUIRE: Thank you. BERMAN: You guys are working very hard on this. And again, please let us know how we can help more, John Feal and Brian McGuire. Thanks very much for being us this morning.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: And we are honored to have them as viewers of CNN.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: We are honored that they watch us this morning and they could never have found a better spokesperson -- well, first of all -- than those two gentlemen.</p><p>BERMAN: Yes.</p><p>CAMEROTA: But also, Jon Stewart. I mean, obviously, his passion has so aligned with their need and it just works to get everyone's attention.</p><p>BERMAN: Well, how can you not have passion when you listen to John and Brian tell their story? When they talk about how they had to drive down, get out of the car to take their medication. The sacrifices they are making to have to go and beg to get the money that they need. And this problem is not going away.</p><p>CAMEROTA: And as they point out, they didn't wait for a second when 9/11 called. They, within five seconds as Jon Stewart said, responded.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, a lot more ahead. We'll be right back.</p><p>[07:46:21] CAMEROTA: So, what is it like to work for President Trump? A former top executive with the Trump Organization is offering insight into the president's family business in a new book called \"The Real Deal: My Decade Fighting Battles and Winning Wars With Trump.\"</p><p>CNN's Cristina Alesci just interviewed author George Sorial and she joins us now. Cristina, what did you learn?</p><p>CRISTINA ALESCI, CNN BUSINESS AND POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: So, this is a guy who has worked alongside and with the president on a number of projects for over a decade, and he just left the company to promote this book.</p><p>But while he was at the company he was at the center of a fight over whether or not the president's company should be accepting payments from governments, both domestic and foreign, and that was a very interesting part of the interview.</p><p>But what struck me most about this interview was the fact that he couldn't give me a direct answer when I pressed him on whether the president lies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GEORGE SORIAL, FORMER EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, THE TRUMP ORGANIZATION, AUTHOR, \"THE REAL DEAL: MY DECADE FIGHTING BATTLES AND WINNING WARS WITH TRUMP\": He's a firm believer in hitting back. For some people it may not work, but that's his style. That's what makes him comfortable.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): That's the way he --</p><p>SORIAL: But there was a whole --</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): That's the way he fights.</p><p>SORIAL: Yes, and there was a whole --</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): He's going to hit below the belt, he's going to be unfair, and he's very upfront about it.</p><p>SORIAL: Well --</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): So, my question to you is does that include lying? If he has to lie to win, will he?</p><p>SORIAL: I can't answer that question. And, you know, look, the way --</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): Why? I mean --</p><p>SORIAL: You cannot measure someone like Trump who is a consummate salesman. You have to measure him in his actions. You can't look at every single word he said.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): He's the President of the United States. We have to look at every single word he says now.</p><p>SORIAL: He's an unconventional president and I think you get what you see.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): Does that include lying?</p><p>SORIAL: He's never lied to me.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): Have you ever seen him lie?</p><p>SORIAL: You know, again, he's never lied to me. Lying was not part of our business model.</p><p>ALESCI (voice-over): But now, Congress and law enforcement are investigating whether The Trump Organization has been forthright about its business dealings.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): Do you think that the company itself has some existential challenges given the backdrop that it's operating against?</p><p>SORIAL: You know, look, dealing with any kind of litigation or investigation -- again, I would be disingenuous if I didn't admit that is it a challenge? Of course, it's a challenge, but it's a challenge that we're up for. It's a challenge that we will meet and defeat.</p><p>ALESCI (voice-over): One of the fiercest critics in Congress, House Oversight Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, who blasted The Trump Organization's program to donate foreign hotel profits to the U.S. Treasury, an effort that Sorial led as chief compliance counsel.</p><p>Cummings said the firm didn't go far enough to alleviate concerns about potential conflicts of interest, belittling the company's plan as a pamphlet.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): He's still not happy with your plan.</p><p>SORIAL: Privately and publicly, we have offered to sit down and talk to him about some of these things.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): So why do you think he doesn't want to meet with you?</p><p>SORIAL: It's politics. There's no interest in finding fact. They're out to bring down anyone that's in that circle to make him look bad. That's why meetings like the one I suggested have never taken place.</p><p>ALESCI (voice-over): Despite facing multiple inquiries, Sorial predicts the business will see explosive growth after Trump leaves office, even if Trump doesn't come back to run the company himself.</p><p>SORIAL: That's the billion-dollar question -- what does he do post- presidency? I don't know. You know, I don't think anybody knows except him.</p><p>ALESCI (on camera): Why would you doubt that he would come back?</p><p>SORIAL: You'd have to ask him what he's going to do. But, I -- you know, would it surprise me if he came back? No. Would it surprise me if he didn't come back? No.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[07:50:03] ALESCI: Alisyn, I called the Democratic -- the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee and they shot back at Sorial for suggesting the Democrats are targeting the firm because of politics, saying that Congress has the power to ensure that the president is complying with the Constitution and they plan to continue their lawsuit against The Trump Organization on that particular front.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Really revealing interview. And how great that he could imply when you asked him --</p><p>BERMAN: No.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- if the president -- if he had seen the president lie or if lying was part of the business model, he was struggling to answer because it seemed like he didn't want to lie to you.</p><p>ALESCI: It was -- that was the point that I found most interesting.</p><p>BERMAN: Imagine that. Imagine that, not wanting to lie when asked a direct question like that.</p><p>CAMEROTA: It's going to take a lot of imagination at this point.</p><p>BERMAN: Cristina, that was great. Thank you very much.</p><p>ALESCI: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. The first in a series of hearing into concerns about big tech companies underway. What does Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg think about it? A new interview with one of the social media giant's top executives, that's next.</p><p>[07:55:19] BERMAN: Congress is holding hearings into anticompetitive behavior among the tech giants. It comes as Facebook debuts a new blood donations feature designed to make it easier to know where to donate.</p><p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta live in Denver with his exclusive interview with Facebook's COO Sheryl Sandberg -- Sanjay.</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Hey, good morning, John.</p><p>Yes -- you know, how much of this is a -- sort of an attempt by Facebook to establish some goodwill in the face of these hearings that are going on on Capitol Hill versus just trying to use Facebook for what it could be uniquely poised to do to sort of create these social communities, specifically in this case around blood donation?</p><p>I sat down with Sheryl Sandberg. She doesn't do a lot of interviews. I've got to tell you, she was surprisingly personally sort of passionate John about this topic.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): When you think about donating blood you probably think about disasters, mass shootings, tornadoes, utter devastation.</p><p>CLIFF NUMARK, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, AMERICAN RED CROSS: The irony is the patients who suffer from those tragedies -- actually, they're alive because people, days before, had given blood to make sure that it's readily available.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): As a doctor at level one trauma center, I've seen the extraordinary demand. In fact, every two seconds in the United States, a patient needs the gift of blood.</p><p>SHERYL SANDBERG, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, FACEBOOK: There are so many medical problems in the world, which are not medical problems. They are marketing problems, convincing people to do the right thing. And so, this is a problem we can solve.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): You don't do a lot of interviews, yet you decided to talk about this particular topic. Why is that? SANDBERG: Because I really care about this. You know, this is about bringing people together, which is core to our mission, to help solve a problem.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): The problem, the Red Cross says only three percent of people in the United States who can give blood do so.</p><p>Sheryl Sandberg thinks Facebook is uniquely poised to step in.</p><p>SANDBERG: We're going to put a notice right at the top of the newsfeed asking people to register if they want to. And if you register with our partners like the American Red Cross, if there's a need for blood in your city they're going to be able to notify you.</p><p>GUPTA (voice-over): It's something Facebook has already done in four other countries and signed up more than 35 million people as blood donors. But, of course, that's no guarantee people will actually donate or that they'll trust Facebook to facilitate that happening.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): Health information is the most intimate information people have and there's been concerns about privacy. How do you balance that?</p><p>SANDBERG: Well, with blood donations, we're not using or giving out any personal information.</p><p>We show you a notice. You choose to go to a partner site like the American Red Cross and register. They'll send you a notification and then you can choose to give them your information. We're not passing any individual information at all.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN: So, Sanjay, you brought up the issue of privacy with Sandberg. Did she have anything to say about yesterday's hearings on Capitol Hill?</p><p>GUPTA: Well, it was -- it was a little bit of this back-and-forth because we're sitting there talking about blood donation in Menlo Park and these hearings are going on on Capitol Hill.</p><p>I asked her specifically -- you know, this call for regulation, seemingly from everywhere, how was Facebook going to respond to that? And also, what do they think that regulation should look like going forward.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SANDBERG: We've actually called for regulation. We think there's a lot of work to do to protect elections. We think there's a lot of work to do to protect privacy to make sure the right content is on Facebook. And, we believe we have a deep responsibility -- a lot we need to do to do better and get it right.</p><p>But we're also not just waiting for regulation. In a lot of these areas, we've moved ahead to make sure that we implement things, hoping the right regulation will happen. But we have a responsibility to act even before that.</p><p>GUPTA (on camera): And what does the right regulation look like?</p><p>SANDBERG: Well, there are a lot of different examples in different areas. But, you know, we believe, for example, what content should be allowed. That's a really important decision.</p><p>So we are in the process of heading up an independent board that people on Facebook will be able to refer things to, and they're going to make a judgment and that judgment is going to stick, even above our own judgment.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BERMAN: Really interesting to hear that discussion.</p><p>GUPTA: John, that's the first time I sort of heard some of that.</p><p>BERMAN: Go ahead.</p><p>GUPTA: Yes. I mean, not so insular, actually talking about an independent board to look at content and to make those judgments real time. It will be interesting to see how this all sort of plays out, John.</p><p>BERMAN: It will. She's so careful when she talks about the privacy issue, though -- the words chosen so carefully.</p><p>GUPTA: Yes.</p><p>BERMAN: Dr. Sanjay Gupta, always great to have you on. Thanks so much. Appreciate it -- Alisyn.</p><p>GUPTA: You got it, John. Thank you.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John.</p><p>Protests have turned violent in Hong Kong. NEW DAY continues right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Four years of Donald Trump will be viewed as an aberration in American history.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: When a man has to mention.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Elizabeth Warren proposes to break up the Big Tech giants of Amazon, Google and Facebook.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her focus is a bit odd because Warren, as a Harvard academic, first achieved national attention as co-author of a study claiming that medical bills were to blame for 62 percent of bankruptcies. It ignited a scholarly debate that continues. But health-care companies have gotten big \u2014 PricewaterhouseCoopers reported 255 mergers and acquisitions in the second quarter of 2018 alone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Warren was also the one who established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal agency to police the scams and hustles inflicted on households in the run-up to the financial panic of 2008 and the Great Recession. Many of the worst actors were big banks.</p><p> So it's not just Big Tech that needs the equivalent of trust busting \u2014 something I proposed in a column a year ago.</p><p> Health-care companies, banks, airlines, railroads, media companies, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Telecom and more are too big and stifle competition, innovation, job creation, wages and customer choice. The share of young companies has been declining in America.</p><p> Yet Warren chose Big Tech rather than the areas where she has the most expertise. One can assume she's trying to get ahead of a left-moving Democratic Party at a time when prominent technology giants are in bad odor.</p><p> In a Medium column where she fleshed out her ideas, she wrote, \"Today's big tech companies have too much power? \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They've bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else. And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation.\"</p><p> Paradoxically, however, she nearly undermines her argument by claiming that the Microsoft antitrust action in the 1990s helped clear a path for internet companies like Google and Facebook to emerge.</p><p> Well, maybe. But Microsoft is bigger and healthier than ever \u2014 the Beast of Redmond is well-liked, too \u2014 and the \"successes\" she cites are now giant corporations she says need breaking up themselves. So perhaps the Microsoft lawsuit cleared a path, but the fundamental problem of bigness remains.</p><p> Like the Green New Deal and raising top marginal tax rates on the rich, breaking up Big Tech is an idea in motion, the start of a conversation. But it has political appeal beyond the left, as Big Tech's reputation has taken a big slide in a new Harris Poll.</p><p> And like the other proposals, it stands little chance of becoming law anytime soon because of the red-state lock on the Senate. Presidents alone can't make this happen, but they can appoint regulators \u2014 no small thing.</p><p> The late 19th century's Gilded Age was characterized by monopolies and cartels, as well as high inequality, protected by the political power of the wealthy. It didn't last, giving birth to the Progressive era, with antitrust and regulation reigning in the worst abuses.</p><p> For example, John D. Rockefeller's mighty Standard Oil was split into 34 companies in 1911, in a case that went to the Supreme Court.</p><p> This tough stance continued through much of the 20th century, with an exclamation point being the 1982 breakup of the Bell System.</p><p> But big business and conservative intellectuals began fighting back in the 1970s. Especially influential was Robert Bork, more widely known for his failed nomination to the Supreme Court. Bork's most consequential achievement was dramatically redefining antitrust laws.</p><p> Instead of protecting smaller businesses and ensuring competition, antitrust laws should encourage economic efficiency, Bork argued. This revolutionary interpretation gradually took hold in the federal courts until it was the standard by which mergers and company size were judged. Or given a pass. The Bell System essentially reconstituted itself in recent years.</p><p> Especially since the 1980s, critical sectors of the economy have been taken over by cartels and semi-monopolies with unbeatable pricing power along the supply chain. (How many anti-Amazon New York City protesters went home and ordered something on Amazon because it was cheaper and more convenient than patronizing their local shops?)</p><p> Not just the courts backed lax antitrust. It was supported by both Republican and Democratic administrations, as well as deregulation such as the Glass-Steagall Act. The big banks brought on the Great Recession \u2014 the best argument yet against bigness \u2014 yet they came out of the crisis even bigger.</p><p> As a result, Warren and the Democratic left would have to win many elections and gain a Supreme Court majority before a new era of trust busting could get underway. It's a rough ride that Theodore Roosevelt never faced.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNE-74fa4affeaf6dd713b990aecfc4fd32ef5cd1b1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289B12C2B3CAD4 NWBKNE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNG-T9R1-DXVP-V0W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Lee Enterprises, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Fue director general de regulaci\u00f3n y estabilidad financiera del Banco de Espa\u00f1a (2000 y 2013). Nacido en Teruel hace 54 a\u00f1os. Est\u00e1 casado y tiene tres hijos. Le encanta su tierra, donde acude siempre que puede. Su pasi\u00f3n es pasear por el campo y la fotograf\u00eda. Descarta que se est\u00e9 formando una nueva burbuja inmobiliaria o del cr\u00e9dito al consumo. Y considera que pese a que la banca espa\u00f1ola est\u00e1 a la cola en capitalizaci\u00f3n en Europa, es la mejor preparada para resistir ante los mismo riesgos. Reconoce que la competencia ahora es \u201cm\u00e1s dura tras la entrada de las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech</emphasis>\u201d. En estos d\u00edas han vuelto a intensificarse las recomendaciones para que se produzcan fusiones transfronterizas europeas. </p><p>Dani\u00e8le Nouy, presidenta del Mecanismo \u00danico de Supervisi\u00f3n (MUS), ha sido siempre muy contundente al defender las fusiones paneuropeas. Siempre ha dicho que necesitamos campeones europeos. Todos pensamos que necesitamos bancos paneuropeos, si no se produce ninguna en 10 a\u00f1os la uni\u00f3n bancaria  habr\u00e1 fracasado, aunque este proceso va muy lento, m\u00e1s de lo previsto. Y eso que necesitamos grandes bancos que puedan competir con la banca de EE UU o de China, que cuentan con gigantes bancarios. La crisis financiera aceler\u00f3 la b\u00fasqueda de soluciones para crear la uni\u00f3n bancaria europea, pero una vez pasada esta crisis es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil que los pa\u00edses se pongan de acuerdo. Alemania es el pa\u00eds m\u00e1s reacio. Pero mi impresi\u00f3n es que al final se avanzar\u00e1. Para la creaci\u00f3n del fondo de garant\u00eda europeo solo es Alemania el pa\u00eds que pone inconvenientes por su problema con las cooperativas y las cajas de ahorros, que tienen garant\u00edas mutuas con prestaciones m\u00e1s altas que los 100.000 euros. Con un nuevo Parlamento Europeo y una nueva comisi\u00f3n se podr\u00eda acelerar el proceso para crear un fondo de garant\u00eda. \u00bfCree entonces que la banca de Estados Unidos es un peligro para la europea? La banca americana no solo no ha perdido posiciones respecto a la europea, sino que las ha ganado, aunque la crisis financiera comenz\u00f3 en EE UU, lo que no deja de ser un poco parad\u00f3jico. Puede ser porque han tenido una posici\u00f3n m\u00e1s \u00e1gil para solucionar la crisis y por eso han ganado posiciones de liderazgo. Pero creo que Europa no tendr\u00eda que aceptar esa posici\u00f3n de liderazgo. Europa es la econom\u00eda m\u00e1s grande del mundo, aunque cuando se produzca el Brexit lo dejar\u00e1 de ser, pero en estos momentos lo es. Por qu\u00e9 entonces no tener jugadores globales si somos la mayor econom\u00eda. Y espero que los protagonistas sean las entidades espa\u00f1olas, que son fuertes, internacionales y muy bien posicionados en Europa. \u00bfHabr\u00e1 m\u00e1s fusiones en Espa\u00f1a adem\u00e1s de la prevista entre Unicaja y Liberbank? A ra\u00edz de la crisis en Espa\u00f1a se ha producido un intenso proceso de consolidaci\u00f3n en el sector bancario. Quiz\u00e1s el mayor de toda la eurozona. No obstante, los beneficios de las econom\u00edas de escala siguen constituyendo un factor muy importante en esta industria que trabaja con m\u00e1rgenes cada vez m\u00e1s peque\u00f1os y que, adem\u00e1s, tiene que afrontar en los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os procesos como el regulatorio (MREL), la transformaci\u00f3n digital y la evoluci\u00f3n hacia una econom\u00eda m\u00e1s sostenible y libre de los efectos del cambio clim\u00e1tico. Para estos procesos y para ganar rentabilidad, la variable de la escala va a ser determinante. \u00bfEl sector va a recuperar su reputaci\u00f3n? La reputaci\u00f3n tarda mucho en ganarse y se pierde en seguida. En estos momentos, la banca ha sido totalmente ajena a lo que ha sucedido con la normativa fiscal del impuesto de actos jur\u00eddicos documentados. Sin hacer nada, nuestra reputaci\u00f3n se ha visto da\u00f1ada. Solo hemos cumplido con la legislaci\u00f3n. Hay que concienciar a la sociedad que es muy importante la presencia de una banca sana en un pa\u00eds porque si queremos una financiaci\u00f3n fuerte y s\u00f3lida es imprescindible tener bancos sanos. Si tenemos una banca d\u00e9bil tendremos una econom\u00eda d\u00e9bil. Hay que recordar que el sistema hipotecario espa\u00f1ol ha permitido que los espa\u00f1oles tengan un porcentaje de viviendas en propiedad mucho m\u00e1s elevado que en el resto de Europa, y con una financiaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s barata. Y eso se ha producido porque ten\u00edamos unos bancos fuertes. Si queremos que la banca financie en los tiempos malos, que vendr\u00e1n, necesitamos unos bancos fuertes. No hay que caer en el desaliento. Es dif\u00edcil, pero recuperaremos la reputaci\u00f3n. \u00bfPol\u00edticos, jueces o la sociedad en general est\u00e1n en contra de la banca? La banca nunca ha sido popular. No podemos aspirar a que la popularidad sea alta, pero s\u00ed a que la gente entienda que en el d\u00eda a d\u00eda es fundamental esa relaci\u00f3n con su banco. Los clientes no tienen una buena opini\u00f3n el sector, pero s\u00ed del banco con el que trabajan. Hay una diferenciaci\u00f3n de la percepci\u00f3n colectiva y la individual. El cliente est\u00e1 c\u00f3modo con su banco y por eso le conf\u00eda lo m\u00e1s valioso para vivir, sus ahorros,  una hipoteca, que va a estar con \u00e9l muchos a\u00f1os, y conf\u00eda en su banco a la hora de proteger sus datos. Mucho m\u00e1s que en otro tipo de operadores. Lo que hay que hacer es que la imagen colectiva mejore. La imagen del banquero con puro y chistera hace much\u00edsimos a\u00f1os que ha desaparecido. Somos muy peque\u00f1os como sector, solo representamos entre el 2% al 3% de la producci\u00f3n, pero sin ese 3% que representa la banca ser\u00eda muy dif\u00edcil que el 97% restante funcionara de forma correcta. \u00bfLa reputaci\u00f3n bancaria es tan negativa en el resto de Europa? En todos los pa\u00edses en alg\u00fan momento en el que se han producido dificultades ha descendido su reputaci\u00f3n. Ahora est\u00e1 pasando en los casos de operaciones de blanqueo de capitales, donde hay mucho que discutir. La situaci\u00f3n reputacional en Espa\u00f1a no es muy distinta a la de otros pa\u00edses del entorno. \u00bfLa fragmentaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica influye en el sector? Tenemos que aceptar que la situaci\u00f3n de menor estabilidad pol\u00edtica va a durar mucho tiempo. Tenemos que aprender a ser holandeses o daneses. Debemos aprender a vivir con una fragmentaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica.  \u00bfLas hipotecas van a subir de precio tras tener que asumir el banco casi todos los gastos, incluidos los del impuesto de actos jur\u00eddicos documentados?  Espa\u00f1a es uno de los pa\u00edses con los costes no financieros m\u00e1s caros de Europa. El impuesto de actos jur\u00eddicos documentados no existe en la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses europeos, y donde existe lo paga el cliente y es mucho m\u00e1s bajo. Entonces tenemos que ser conscientes de que si los gastos no financieros de una hipoteca son mucho m\u00e1s caros en Espa\u00f1a que en otros pa\u00edses, indudablemente eso va a tener impacto en el coste de la hipoteca. Adem\u00e1s, la traslaci\u00f3n de estos gastos a precios depender\u00e1 de la elasticidad de las curvas de  oferta y  demanda. En funci\u00f3n del grado de competencia y la fortaleza de la demanda de hipotecas tendremos un efecto sobre precios y cantidades disponibles. Pero a m\u00ed lo que me preocupa son los fen\u00f3menos de exclusi\u00f3n financiera porque no hay peor trato para un usuario que no tener acceso a la financiaci\u00f3n. No creo que estemos en ese escenario, pero tenemos que tener mucho cuidado en un futuro de no caer en un problema que ahora no existe en Espa\u00f1a como es el de no tener acceso al cr\u00e9dito. Es ah\u00ed donde tenemos que ser m\u00e1s cuidadosos. \u00bfQu\u00e9 opina de la futura ley hipotecaria?  Se pueden producir mejoras. Lo vemos como una oportunidad para iniciar una nueva relaci\u00f3n con el cliente, con productos m\u00e1s sencillos, y que den lugar a menos malentendidos. Adem\u00e1s, esperamos que la ley no contenga elementos que hagan imposible conceder  hipotecas. Por ejemplo, si no se permite una comisi\u00f3n por una cancelaci\u00f3n anticipada de una hipoteca a tipo fijo, va a ser imposible a un banco hacer frente a una hipoteca a tipo fijo porque el cliente se puede ir en cualquier momento, pero el banco se quedar\u00eda con ese coste. La comisi\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 para cubrir el coste que tiene el banco por la cobertura de tipos de inter\u00e9s que la entidad tiene que hacer. Si queremos que en Espa\u00f1a se promocionen las hipotecas a tipo fijo se debe contar con una comisi\u00f3n de cancelaci\u00f3n adecuada, si no nos vamos a separar m\u00e1s de Europa, que tiene  m\u00e1s hipotecas de tipo fijo.   \u00bfCon la nueva ley se pondr\u00e1 fin a los litigios y a la inseguridad jur\u00eddica? Los efectos retroactivos que incluyen algunas sentencias son muy da\u00f1inos, m\u00e1s cuando se han cumplido con las reglas de juego vigentes. Esperamos que con la nueva ley finalicen o se reduzcan los litigios. Queremos tener una nueva relaci\u00f3n con el cliente. \u00bfLa competencia en m\u00e1s dura ahora, sobre todo tras la irrupci\u00f3n de las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech</emphasis>?  La competencia con las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech </emphasis>hace que la rivalidad sea m\u00e1s dura que en pasado. La tecnolog\u00eda tambi\u00e9n cambia el nivel de competencia del sector. En cuanto haya un segmento del negocio con una rentabilidad importante va a nacer un nuevo operador que va a intentar hacer esa actividad a un precio menor que lo que lo est\u00e1 haciendo el sector. La tecnolog\u00eda cambia radicalmente la competencia, y sobre todo c\u00f3mo se debe medir ese grado de competencia en el sector. El peligro es que  las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech </emphasis>o las<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech </emphasis>se conviertan en banco en todo aquello que es rentable para una entidad y dejen lo que no es rentable solo para los bancos tradicionales, como es la captaci\u00f3n de dep\u00f3sitos para transformar sus plazos. Entonces habr\u00eda un problema y no solo competitivo, ya que si los bancos solo se quedan con la parte de captaci\u00f3n de dep\u00f3sitos y pierden los negocios auxiliares que son rentables se producir\u00eda un potencial problema de financiaci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda productiva que habr\u00eda que resolver. Por eso queremos igualdad competitiva. No es posible que la protecci\u00f3n de datos sea superior en un banco que en una<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> fintech</emphasis>. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CINCOD-661776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CINCOD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V0M-42J1-F12V-S3PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222705</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1601\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Estructura, Grupo De Estudios Economicos, S.A.

EARNEST</emphasis>:  I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy.  Any chances that the President would meet with him there?  Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders.  This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II.  That will be the focal point of the President's activities.  When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on.  I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there.  Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.  </p><p>      That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on.  And that's about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Is he actively going to avoid Putin?  I mean, would he even see him?  And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Again, this is still a month away here.  I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much.  And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin.  </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves.  And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy.  It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events.  But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria.  Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role.  So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation.  But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.  </p><p>      The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide.  There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.  </p><p>      So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts.  We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community.  The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria.  But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation.  We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall.  The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there.  So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that?  And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I don't think so.  I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country.  There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians.  We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.  Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.  </p><p>      So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram.  And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama.  </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this?  And do you have a response to it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning.  If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital.  Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary.  Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki.  I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran.  Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans.  And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.  </p><p>      I would say -- point out a couple of other things.  The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there.  I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.  </p><p>      I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously.  But there's a lot more work to be done.  We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened.  But we have turned that tide.  It's moving in the right direction.  And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi.  Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Quick question on sequestration.  There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies.  Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off.  Any White House input on that?  I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP. </p><p>      So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester.  And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.  </p><p>      I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester.  And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.  </p><p>      So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, again, I think that's according to one report.  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service.  The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.  </p><p>      So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night.  He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House.  Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year?  I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that.  Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  He believes that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  What gives him that belief?   Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Let me answer that question two ways.  The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats.  The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.  </p><p>           The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections.  We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot.  And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.  </p><p>           So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Just one more question about them.  He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  It was sort of near the end of his remarks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process.  I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington.  And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.  </p><p>           The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country.  The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country.  And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.  </p><p>           So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do.  I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that.  How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections.  And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.  </p><p>           As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified.  And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.  </p><p>           And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.  </p><p>           There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take.  I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else.  The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out.  This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012.  That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did.  And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.  </p><p>           Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust.  The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience.  They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action.  And that's not always easy.  And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"  </p><p>           And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world.  And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.  </p><p>      And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental.  I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"  </p><p>      So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do.  Is that right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make.  I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world.  And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.  </p><p>      Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down.  This is an autonomous government.  But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down.  And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up.  It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there.  This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies.  I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming.  They've been active on the immigration front.  With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion.  We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country.  So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.  </p><p>      I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.  </p><p>      So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy?  It seems like it's a bit of a mix.  I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Yes, he can.  And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved.  There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can.  But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now.  The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.  </p><p>      Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody.  There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy.  Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies.  So there's a wide range of reasons.  </p><p>      And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress.  And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it.  How does the White House feel?  Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill?  Is it enough that has been done?  Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Not really.  Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C59-HJT1-JDPT-T19M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

EARNEST</emphasis>:  I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  President Putin going to Normandy.  Any chances that the President would meet with him there?  Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders.  This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II.  That will be the focal point of the President's activities.  When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on.  I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and President Putin at this point.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Chancellor Merkel said today she welcomes Putin's presence there.  Does President Obama feel the same way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.  </p><p>      That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on.  And that's about it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Is he actively going to avoid Putin?  I mean, would he even see him?  And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Again, this is still a month away here.  I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much.  And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with President Putin.  It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves.  And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy.  It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events.  But I don't know that there was any advance notice of President Putin's plans.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria.  Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role.  So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation.  But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.  </p><p>      The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide.  There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.  </p><p>      So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts.  We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community.  The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria.  But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation.  We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall.  The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there.  So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that?  And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I don't think so.  I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country.  There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians.  We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.  Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.  </p><p>      So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram.  And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to President Obama.  Are you all familiar with this?  And do you have a response to it?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning.  If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital.  Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary.  Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki.  I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran.  Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans.  And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.  </p><p>      I would say -- point out a couple of other things.  The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there.  I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.  </p><p>      I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously.  But there's a lot more work to be done.  We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened.  But we have turned that tide.  It's moving in the right direction.  And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi.  Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Quick question on sequestration.  There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies.  Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off.  Any White House input on that?  I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP. </p><p>      So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester.  And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.  </p><p>      I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester.  And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.  </p><p>      So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, again, I think that's according to one report.  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service.  The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.  </p><p>      So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night.  He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House.  Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year?  I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that.  Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Absolutely.  He believes that --  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  What gives him that belief?   Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Let me answer that question two ways.  The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats.  The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.  </p><p>           The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections.  We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot.  And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.  </p><p>           So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Just one more question about them.  He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  It was sort of near the end of his remarks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process.  I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington.  And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.  </p><p>           The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country.  The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country.  And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.  </p><p>           So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do.  I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that.  How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections.  And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.  </p><p>           As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified.  And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.  </p><p>           And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.  </p><p>           There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take.  I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else.  The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out.  This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012.  That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did.  And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.  </p><p>           Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust.  The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience.  They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action.  And that's not always easy.  And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"  </p><p>           And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world.  And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.  </p><p>      And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental.  I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"  </p><p>      So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do.  Is that right?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make.  I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world.  And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.  </p><p>      Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down.  This is an autonomous government.  But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down.  And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up.  It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there.  This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies.  I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming.  They've been active on the immigration front.  With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion.  We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country.  So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.  </p><p>      I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.  </p><p>      So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy?  It seems like it's a bit of a mix.  I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Yes, he can.  And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved.  There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can.  But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now.  The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.  </p><p>      Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody.  There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy.  Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies.  So there's a wide range of reasons.  </p><p>      And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress.  And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it.  How does the White House feel?  Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill?  Is it enough that has been done?  Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MR. EARNEST</emphasis>:  Not really.  Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FMRWRE2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C59-HJT1-JDPT-T18P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345281</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>Financial Markets Regulatory Wire</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

EARNEST: I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away. QUESTION: <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>going to Normandy. Any chances that the President would meet with him there? Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MR. EARNEST: At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders. This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II. That will be the focal point of the President's activities. When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on. I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and <person><nameText>President Putin </nameText></person>at this point.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: <person><nameText>Chancellor Merkel </nameText></person>said today she welcomes Putin's presence there. Does <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>feel the same way?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p/><p>That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on. And that's about it.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Is he actively going to avoid Putin? I mean, would he even see him? And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Again, this is still a month away here. I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much. And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with <person><nameText>President Putin. </nameText></person>It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves. And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy. It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events. But I don't know that there was any advance notice of <person><nameText>President Putin's </nameText></person>plans.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria. Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role. So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation. But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p/><p>The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide. There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p/><p>So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts. We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community. The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria. But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation. We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall. The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there. So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that? And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think so. I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country. There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians. We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations. Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p/><p>So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram. And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to <person><nameText>President Obama. </nameText></person>Are you all familiar with this? And do you have a response to it?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning. If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital. Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary. Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki. I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran. Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans. And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p/><p>I would say -- point out a couple of other things. The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there. I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p/><p>I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously. But there's a lot more work to be done. We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened. But we have turned that tide. It's moving in the right direction. And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi. Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Quick question on sequestration. There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies. Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off. Any White House input on that? I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP. So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester. And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p/><p>I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester. And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p/><p>So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, again, I think that's according to one report. I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service. The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p/><p>So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night. He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House. Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year? I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that. Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Absolutely. He believes that --</p><p/><p>QUESTION: What gives him that belief? Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Let me answer that question two ways. The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats. The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p/><p>The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections. We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot. And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p/><p>So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Just one more question about them. He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth. Can you talk a little bit about that? It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process. I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington. And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p/><p>The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country. The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country. And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p/><p>So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do. I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that. How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections. And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified. And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p/><p>There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take. I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else. The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out. This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012. That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did. And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p/><p>Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust. The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience. They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action. And that's not always easy. And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"</p><p/><p>And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world. And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p/><p>And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental. I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"</p><p/><p>So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do. Is that right?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make. I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world. And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p/><p>Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down. This is an autonomous government. But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down. And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up. It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there. This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies. I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming. They've been active on the immigration front. With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion. We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country. So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p/><p>I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p/><p>So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy? It seems like it's a bit of a mix. I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Yes, he can. And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved. There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can. But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now. The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p/><p>Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody. There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy. Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies. So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p/><p>And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress. And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p/><p>QUESTION: Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it. How does the White House feel? Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill? Is it enough that has been done? Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p/><p>MR. EARNEST: Not really. Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p/><p>END</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-3297280481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C5D-1831-F190-V3J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4337\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 8, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS:921120</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-terms\"><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUxREE5N0M3MEQ4NEY5QkI0MURGRDY3RDM1MUQxRDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkI5QzFFRjAxMEFFNDMxOThENUE1RjVCQUYzQkQ2RjQ</classCode><className>The Presidency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001814</classCode><className>WAR &amp; CONFLICT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DHPL</classCode><className>GERMAN CHANCELLORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST00098AA</classCode><className>INTERGOVERNMENTAL TALKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009UHD</classCode><className>ANGELA MERKEL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009TJP</classCode><className>BARACK OBAMA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX543</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES, CA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

EARNEST:  I do not have anything at the top, so if you guys just want to start by firing away.      QUESTION:  President Putin going to Normandy.  Any chances that the President would meet with him there?  Does the President have any apprehensions about Putin going?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">      MR. EARNEST:  At this point, we do not anticipate that the President will do any bilateral meetings with any world leaders.  This is primarily an opportunity for the President and leaders from around the globe to pay tribute to the heroism of Allied forces that led to victory in World War II.  That will be the focal point of the President's activities.  When he's there, he'll deliver some remarks, and that will be what he's focused on.  I don't anticipate at this point that there's a meeting between the President and President Putin at this point.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Chancellor Merkel said today she welcomes Putin's presence there.  Does President Obama feel the same way?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, look, we're focused on remembering the sacrifices and heroism of troops who were part of the Greatest Generation, who liberated a continent and confronted the evil that the President talked about pretty eloquently last night.</p><p/><p>      That will be the focus of the President's trip to Normandy, and that's what we're focused on.  And that's about it.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Is he actively going to avoid Putin?  I mean, would he even see him?  And is this likely to change, that you might decide to have a meeting?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Again, this is still a month away here.  I can tell you what we're focused on, and that's -- the President is looking forward to this trip very much.  And again, he talked last night about why this will be a memorable, moving, important trip for him, and it has nothing to do with President Putin.  It has everything to do with a generation of Americans and allies who liberated a continent and did so at great risk to themselves.  And that's what the President will be doing when he's traveling to Normandy.  It will be an opportunity for him to pay tribute to that brave generation.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Josh, had the White House expected Putin to go all along, or was this a surprise?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I mean, if you consider that Russian soldiers were fighting on the same side as American soldiers in that battle, it shouldn't be a remarkable surprise that the President of Russia would attend and commemorate these events.  But I don't know that there was any advance notice of President Putin's plans.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Josh, every day we see more of an outpouring of concern from Americans, and including on Capitol Hill, about kidnappings in Nigeria.  Are you going to change any plans to increase the American presence there and put actual people on the ground, in the bush, looking for these children?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Well, I can tell you that military assistance that we've talked about providing over the last couple of days will primarily be in an advisory role.  So I would not contemplate a deployment of troops to begin an active military operation.  But there are military resources that can be brought to bear; there's some law enforcement expertise and resources that can be brought to bear to assist the Nigerian government in their efforts to find these girls.</p><p/><p>      The President has made clear that he thinks that's a priority and that there are resources the United States can provide.  There are also resources that other countries who are similarly outraged by what has taken place there, who have also committed to providing some assistance to the Nigerian government.</p><p/><p>      So we're going to continue to work closely with the Nigerian government to support their efforts.  We're going to coordinate those efforts with the international community.  The Department of Defense may be able to provide you some additional details about the resources that will be provided and the timeframe in which those resources will arrive in Nigeria.  But there is a core interagency group in the American embassy in Nigeria that's already hard at work on this.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  There wouldn't be special operations units or anything like that that would be actually involved in the searches?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Right, again, we're not contemplating at this point an active military operation.  We're contemplating military assistance that could be provided that would advise the Nigerian government as they work to find these girls.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Josh, on that, Boko Haram wasn't designated a terrorist organization until November of last fall.  The President this week used stronger language saying that we've already identified them as one of the worst terrorist organizations out there.  So is there a disconnect with why it took longer, a couple years to actually label them that?  And did that hinder our ability to fight them harder earlier before this happened?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I don't think so.  I mean, I'd point out that a number of Boko Haram leaders were designated nearly two years ago for sanctions because of their actions in that country.  There's also been a wide range of military assistance that we've been providing for some time to the Nigerians.  We've provided a great deal of assistance to help the Nigerians professionalize their military, improve their counter-IED capacity, and carry out responsible counterterrorism operations.  Many of those operations were targeted against Boko Haram.</p><p/><p>      So there is an enduring military-to-military relationship between the United States and Nigeria to assist the Nigerian government in fighting the brutal actions of Boko Haram.  And that is a reflection of this President's commitment to rooting out those kind of terroristic groups.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  In a new publication, Josh, the North Korean government uses very insulting terms to refer to President Obama.  Are you all familiar with this?  And do you have a response to it?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I have to be honest, I have not seen that this morning.  If you want to check with my colleagues at the NSC back in Washington they may be able to get you a response.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  A House panel this morning issued subpoenas for VA correspondence related to the Phoenix VA hospital.  Josh [sic] said the other day that the President has full confidence in the VA Secretary.  Has anything changed on that, given the developments of the past couple days?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  The President continues to have complete confidence in Secretary Shinseki.  I'd point out the Secretary himself is somebody who has bravely served this country and he's a West Point graduate and somebody who is obviously also a veteran.  Secretary Shinseki is hard at work and shares the President's passion and commitment for making sure that we live up to the commitments that have been made by this country to our veterans.  And that is something that is a top priority of the President's, and he has full confidence in Secretary Shinseki as he takes on the daunting task of making good on so many of those commitments.</p><p/><p>      I would say -- point out a couple of other things.  The VA did announce in the last couple of days that there were some personnel actions that were taken at the Phoenix VA facility while there's an ongoing investigation into what's actually happed there.  I'd refer you to the VA for the details of those actions.</p><p/><p>      I know that there's also been tremendous progress that's been made by the VA in reducing the claims backlog -- that that backlog has fallen tremendously.  But there's a lot more work to be done.  We're not going to be satisfied until that backlog has been eliminated, and we've got quite a bit of work to do before that's happened.  But we have turned that tide.  It's moving in the right direction.  And that's a testament to the efforts of a lot of people across the administration, including Secretary Shinseki.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Josh, talk on the Hill by Democrats of boycotting the select committee on Benghazi.  Does the White House support or encourage a boycott like that?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I think we've said for the past couple of days, Jim, that we defer to Leader Pelosi and the Democrats in the House of Representatives to make a decision about the best way to participate or not participate in that endeavor.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Quick question on sequestration.  There's a new report that basically says despite doomsday warnings from the White House and lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats saying how many cuts there were going to be, that there was only one job cut among 23 federal agencies.  Senator Coburn is trying to find out more from Burwell just why the predictions were so off.  Any White House input on that?  I mean, I think the administration had said there were going to be hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Well, I would point out that if you look at the -- I think it's a CBO report concluded that if the sequester for 2014 had not been implemented, an additional 800,000 jobs in the private sector -- or in the American economy would have been created, and that would have added six-tenths of a point to GDP.      So there is some independent data out there to indicate that there was a terrible toll, or at least -- maybe a \"terrible toll\" might be a slight overstatement, but a tangible negative impact on our economy sustained as a result of the sequester.  And again, you don't have to take my word for it; I think these are CBO numbers.</p><p/><p>      I believe the CBO also found that there were 750,000 federal workers who had to take a pay cut as a result of the sequester.  And as you pointed out in your question, that there were both Democrats and Republicans who were warning about the negative consequences of the sequester and the impact it could have on our economy.</p><p/><p>      So the President, for all those reasons and more, put forward his own plan for dealing with the sequester, repealing the sequester, and doing actually even more to reduce our deficit in a balanced way.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  I mean, it does appear, though, that it wasn't at least for federal agencies, wasn't as bad as people were predicting. So any reaction to that?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Well, again, I think that's according to one report.  I'm not sure that everybody agrees with those conclusions. And I would point out that even that report did indicate that there was a tangible impact on customer service.  The ability of the federal government to serve the taxpayers, to serve the citizens of this country was negatively affected by the sequester.</p><p/><p>      So if there's somebody who wants to go out there and make the case that the sequester was not that bad and is good policy, they're welcome to do that, but I'm not sure they're going to convince many people of it.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  I have two questions about the President's campaign remarks last night.  He referred to Congresswoman, or Representative Leader Pelosi as the future Speaker of the House.  Does he actually believe that Democrats are going to win the House this year?  I know, obviously, always in campaigns he'd say that.  Does he actually believe there's more than a marginal chance Democrats win the House?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Absolutely.  He believes that --</p><p/><p>           QUESTION:  What gives him that belief?   Because all the models and polling shows it's very, very unlikely.</p><p/><p>           MR. EARNEST:  Let me answer that question two ways.  The first is that if you look at those polls and evaluate where the American public is on a whole range of issues that are priorities to the American people, and on issue after issue either a plurality or a majority of Americans side with Democrats.  The issues are on the side of Democrats in this election.</p><p/><p>           The challenge that we face is, as the President has talked about in sometimes colorful terms, is motivating those voters to show up at the polls in the midterm elections.  We've had great success in convincing those voters to participate in elections when the President's name is at the top of the ballot.  And the President is engaged in an effort in making sure that the American people understand that even though the President's name is not at the top of the ballot, that the stakes of this election are very high, that there are consequences, as the President said last night, for the President's agenda in Congress if Republicans remain in the majority in the House and take over a majority in the Senate.</p><p/><p>           So the stakes are high, and we're going -- the President is very committed to doing what he can to support Democrats and to make the case to the American public that they should get involved in the election and that they should vote based on the priorities that the President has identified and are shared by a majority of voters all across the country.</p><p/><p>           QUESTION:  Just one more question about them.  He seemed to suggest last night that the consequences of losing an election are not beyond just policies not being enacted, but sort of a growing cynicism about government and people believing that Congress can't do anything and split government and so forth.  Can you talk a little bit about that?  It was sort of near the end of his remarks.</p><p/><p>           MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think that he was -- that that cycle that he was talking about had less to do with elections and more about the governing process.  I wouldn't want to parse his remarks too much, but I do think that there is a sense that the gridlock and dysfunction that you all have covered extensively in Washington has led to some pessimism in some corners of the country about the law-making process in Washington.  And if you are pessimistic about that process and pessimistic that decisions are being made for the right reasons in your nation's capital, it might make you less likely to participate in the process.</p><p/><p>           The President believes strongly that regardless of who you're going to vote for, that the country is stronger when people show up and cast a ballot and people get engaged in the governing of their country.  The President gave a very persuasive speech about citizenship during commencement exercises at the University of Michigan early in his first term where he talked about this -- about how if we're going to be good citizens of this country it's going to require us to sort of get outside of our comfort zone, to consider alternate points of view, to be engaged in the debates that are so important to the future of our country.  And some of that engagement also includes following and participating in elections.</p><p/><p>           So I'm confident the President will have more to say about this as Election Day gets closer, as he continues to travel across the country in support of Democratic candidates, something that he will do.  I guess I'm also confident that he'll be somewhat more eloquent in describing these thoughts than I just was.</p><p/><p>           QUESTION:  He also raised the concerns about 2016, the focus being too early on that.  How big a concern is that, that people are already looking toward the next presidential election?</p><p/><p>           MR. EARNEST:  Yes, I think the President has described this phenomenon in our party that voters who tend to support Democrats often consider presidential elections to be more \"sexy,\" I think the President -- is how I think the President described their view of presidential elections.  And part of the challenge that Democrats will face -- and the President is going to be supportive of Democrats in making this argument -- midterm elections have a significant impact on the future of our country, and the outcome of this midterm election could have a very important impact on the ability of this President and Democrats in Congress moving on an agenda that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>           As the President laid out last night, there's a very clear difference between the priorities that Democrats have identified and the priorities that Republicans have identified.  And I think the easiest way to describe that is to point out that Democrats, whether it's equal pay legislation, expanding access to quality retirement programs, raising the minimum wage, are committed to an economic portfolio that expands opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>           And if you look at the Republican offerings, to the extent that they talk about them -- they don't talk about them very often -- but when they do talk about them, it's mostly about expanding opportunity for those at the top, often at the expense of everybody else.</p><p/><p>           There is a very clear difference in the approach that both sides take.  I mean, what Republicans say is that those benefits, if they're targeted to folks at the top, will eventually spread to everybody else.  The President believes that that's not the right way to grow our economy, that the right way to grow our economy is from the middle out.  This was the focus of a lot of debate during the reelection campaign in 2012.  That debate is ongoing and will be an important part of the choice that voters have to make in the midterm elections, too.</p><p/><p>           QUESTION:  In the last speech, what point was he trying to make when he was talking about his powers seem to be limited in some way?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  A couple of people who saw the speech interpreted it quite a bit differently than I did.  And so I actually want to pull up here what I thought was the key part of what the President had to say, if you'll bear with me just one second.</p><p/><p>           Near the end of his remarks, the President said, \"None of the tragedies that we see today may rise to the full horror of the Holocaust.  The individuals who are victims of such unspeakable cruelty, they make a claim on our conscience.  They demand our attention, that we not turn away, that we choose empathy over indifference and that our empathy leads to action.  And that's not always easy.  And one of the powerful things about Schindler's story was recognizing that we have to act, even when there is sometimes ambiguity; even when the path is not always clearly lit, we have to try.\"</p><p/><p>           And I think that was a powerful expression of the President's determination to use the resources of the United States as a force for good in the world.  And that is a President who in a variety of ways has taken a leadership role in the international community, to not just mobilize the resources of the United States, but to mobilize the resources of the international community, of other freedom-loving nations, to make the world a better place -- to combat evil, to confront forces that seek to prey on vulnerable populations.</p><p/><p>      And so whether that is leading an international effort to stand up for the right of the people in Ukraine to determine the future of their country or to be part of an international coalition to track down a couple hundred girls in Nigeria who have been abducted, the President is committed to using his time in office to stand up for the values that we in this country hold so dear -- to use our resources to do that in places all around the world; to use our resources to do that in communities here in this country where sometimes those outcomes aren't clear; but also, to take advantage of the opportunity that the United States is the preeminent leader in the world, and to mobilize international opinion in other like-minded countries in pursuit of these laudable goals and in defense of these values.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  But he also seemed to suggest that some successes are incremental.  I mean, the part you didn't read was, \"I have this remarkable title right now -- President of the United States -- and yet every day when I wake up and I think about young girls in Nigeria or children caught up in the conflict in Syria -- when there are times in which I want to reach out and save those kids -- and having to think through what levers, what power do we have at any given moment, I think, 'drop by drop [by drop],' that we can erode and wear down these forces that are so destructive.\"</p><p/><p>      So it seems that he was acknowledging a certain limitation to what it is that he or anybody in his position can do.  Is that right?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I don't think that's the point that he's trying to make.  I think the point that he is trying to make is that at times it can seem like there's a lot of evil in the world, that there are a lot of bad things happening, and that every morning you're waking up and there's a new thing that's coming across the television screen that seems shocking in a modern 21st century world.  And I think what you saw in those remarks is a resolute determination to act, and that even when the answers aren't easy and even when they aren't clear, that the President believes that in a very -- that the United States has a special responsibility as the preeminent leader in the world to stand up for the rights and wellbeing of 200 little girls who have been kidnapped in Nigeria.</p><p/><p>      Now, it doesn't mean that we can or should take over the search, deploy military resources and track them down.  This is an autonomous government.  But what we can do is look for the ways that we can leverage the resources and expertise and experience that we have in this country to benefit the Nigerian government to track those girls down.  And just because he didn't wake up the next morning and read in the newspapers that those girls have been found, it doesn't mean that we should stop or give up.  It means that the President remains determined every single morning when he wakes up to continue to advance the goal of a freer, a fairer world that better reflects the kinds of values that this country was founded upon.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Josh, the President is fundraising in Silicon Valley later today, two big fundraisers there.  This is an industry that has taken issue with -- on cybersecurity policies.  I believe 100 big tech firms have written to the FCC complaining about the net neutrality regulations that might be forthcoming.  They've been active on the immigration front.  With the amount of money that's concentrated in Silicon Valley and in raising money by Democrats, why shouldn't the public think that perhaps they have some leverage on these issues that others might not?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  I mean, your suggestion is that maybe the tech committee -- or the tech community has inordinate amount of influence in Washington, D.C. because they can make large campaign contributions?</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Yes, and because they have an interest in prominent issues.</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Well, I think my answer to this would be the same, regardless of which industry you would ask me about, which is that I think the reason that the President enjoys quite a bit of success in raising money on behalf of Democrats is because there are a lot of people in a variety of industries all across the country who are very supportive of what the President is trying to do in Washington, D.C. They're supportive of his efforts to -- whether it's an issue like immigration reform to try to find a commonsense path forward in a bipartisan fashion.  We've talked extensively about what kinds of economic benefits that would bring to the country.  So it's not a big surprise that the tech community in particular would be strongly supportive of that.</p><p/><p>      I think that, to go back to somebody's earlier question, I think the thing that breeds a lot of cynicism about the political process are those outside groups that don't disclose their donors, that have a very narrow agenda that's focused on something other than the broad interests of the country.</p><p/><p>      So, again, it's hard for me to sort of assess the position taken by individual participants in today's fundraising events, but I think speaking generally that they are supportive of what the President is trying to do to expand economic opportunity for everybody.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Can I ask a sort of version of Jim's question, which is, isn't it a little bit of a conflict of interest for the President to go to these tech CEOs and so forth, and solicit money from them -- which he is doing for his party -- at the same time his administration is engaged in very high-profile, very controversial, very sensitive negotiations over data, over privacy?  It seems like it's a bit of a mix.  I mean, can he go there and solicit money when he's also in a very big policymaking process around their industry?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Yes, he can.  And there's no reason to think that that policymaking process is affected by the political activities of those who are involved.  There's no question that there are a wide range of issues that the tech community is interested in; they can speak to them better than I can.  But there are a couple of issues related to the FCC that the tech community is very interested in right now.  The FCC is a completely independent body, and they'll be making those regulatory decisions based solely on the merits without any political influence.</p><p/><p>      Other than that, I think that the reason that many of these tech leaders are supportive of the President and Democrats in Congress is because they approve of the President's ongoing efforts to put in place policies that will expand opportunity for everybody.  There's a role for technology to play in expanding opportunity for everybody, giving more people all across the country access to information and knowledge that's good for the economy.  Immigration reform is a great example of this, even fairer tax policies.  So there's a wide range of reasons.</p><p/><p>      And I guess what I'd encourage you to do is to talk to some of these tech leaders about why it is they're participating in the fundraisers, why it is they're in support of the President and Democrats in Congress.  And I think what you'll find is they're broadly supportive of the President's agenda and of the agenda that Democrats are trying to move through the Congress.</p><p/><p>      QUESTION:  Real quick, on the IRS situation and Lois Lerner, everything going on on Capitol Hill -- the President denounced the IRS actions obviously when everything came to light about it.  How does the White House feel?  Is this too much what's happening on Capitol Hill?  Is it enough that has been done?  Should she have talked more? Just all the process going on up there, any reaction to that now?</p><p/><p>      MR. EARNEST:  Not really.  Ms. Lerner is no longer an employee of the federal government, so I don't really have a reaction to the latest congressional votes or activities up there as it relates to her case.</p><p/><p>      END</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-1522416142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J58-PY31-JBHT-D2PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2014 Roll Call, Inc.</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>May 8, 2014 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>House of Representatives</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921120</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Josh Hawley and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren agree your industry has become too powerful, you could be in trouble, and that's the problem facing Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The House Judiciary Committee is drawing support from both sides of the aisle after announcing Monday that it planned to investigate \"the market power held by giant tech platforms,\" which coincided with reports that the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission would pursue their own probes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The growing chorus of concerns about the muscle of the top tech companies  Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google  extends to Silicon Valley, said Mitch Stoltz, senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</p><p> \"I'm here in San Francisco. There's nary a person who doesn't think there are problems, and that they are at least in part problems of monopoly,\" said Mr. Stoltz. \"Not entirely  this is not the cause of nor the solution to all of the problems with the internet today  but it's a factor. Everyone here recognizes that, including some Google, Facebook, Amazon employees.\"</p><p> Tech stocks rebounded after a drop Monday following the House Judiciary Committee's announcement. The big four companies were quiet on the antitrust investigations with the exception of Apple CEO Tim Cook, who denied his company was a monopoly.</p><p> \"If you look at any kind of measure about is Apple a monopoly or not, I don't think anybody reasonable is going to come to the conclusion that Apple is a monopoly,\" Mr. Cook told CBS News.</p><p> The moves to examine the tech companies for suspected antitrust violations come as a pivot from four decades of relative calm on the antitrust front. The last company to be broken up by the federal government was Bell telephone in 1982.</p><p> In Europe, however, Google has been slapped with billions of dollars in fines, most recently a $1.7 billion fine in March for antitrust violations stemming from its online advertising practices, which the company has appealed.</p><p> Similar concerns are growing in Congress, where alarms about privacy, ideological bias and anti-competitive practices are being sounded on the right and left and peeling off some of the tech industry's political allies.</p><p> President Trump has raised antitrust concerns about the U.S. tech industry. So has one of his biggest critics, Ms. Warren, who is seeking the 2020 Democratic presidential nod.</p><p> She posted a billboard Monday in New York City that said, \"Break Up Big Tech.\" Mr. Hawley, Missouri Republican, said a Justice Department investigation was \"big news, and overdue.\"</p><p> \"You're not seeing a divide between conservatives and liberals,\" said Maurice Stucke, professor at the University of Tennessee School of Law. \"I think what you're seeing on both sides is a distrust of the concentration of power.\"</p><p> Rep. David N. Cicilline, Rhode Island Democrat, said the investigation would be led by the antitrust subcommittee, which he chairs, and that it was not focused on a particular company but \"on the marketplace.\"</p><p> \"It's really to look at the behavior of these very big technology companies,\" Mr. Cicilline said on CNN. \"Are they engaged in anti-competitive behavior? Are they respecting the privacy of users? Are they discouraging innovation and entrepreneurship?\"</p><p> Could a breakup be looming? Mr. Cicilline said such speculation was \"much too early\" and that \"Congress doesn't actually have the ability to break up a company, obviously.\"</p><p> At the same time, he said, \"Nothing's off the table in terms of the final resolution.\"</p><p> The Justice Department and FTC investigations could take years. The DOJ's antitrust arm would investigate Google and Apple, while the FTC would have jurisdiction over Facebook and Amazon, according to multiple media outlets.</p><p> Sounding a note of caution was Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Wisconsin Republican, who sits on the antitrust subcommittee and warned about jumping to conclusions.</p><p> \"As the world becomes more dependent on a digital marketplace, we must discuss how the regulatory framework is built to ensure fairness and competition,\" Mr. Sensenbrenner said in a statement. \"I believe these hearings can be informative, but it is important for us to avoid any predetermined conclusions.\"</p><p> Sen. Dianne Feinstein, California Democrat, whose constituency includes Apple, Google and Facebook, said she was pleased to see the hearings on issues such as privacy, criminal activity and hate speech but warned against targeting a handful of firms.</p><p> \"It's important, however, that the focus be broader than just a few companies,\" she said. \"We should examine industrywide practices and enforcement improvements that benefit the American public as a whole. I look forward to that process moving forward.\"</p><p> The digital communications industry spent a record $77.9 million on lobbying in 2018, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p><p> Others, including Sen. Mark R. Warner, Virginia Democrat, have raised questions about whether breaking up U.S. tech companies would empower Chinese digital giants such as Alibaba.</p><p> \"I have some concern, as somebody who is very concerned about the rise of China, that if we were to kind of chop off the legs of Facebook and Google, that they might be replaced by Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent  companies that are totally enmeshed with the Chinese government in their global economic plan, \" Mr. Warner told CNBC in April.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-173DDDE4830F8220</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8G-TR31-DXVP-V1NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>5 June 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Eric Greitens stormed into power the same day Attorney General Josh Hawley took his seat in a suite of offices across from the Capitol. A year passed before Greitens' administration began to collapse. Greitens made few friends in the capital city. In April, he took aim at Hawley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawley had said at a news conference that Greitens likely committed felony computer tampering before taking office. Greitens fired back with a statement saying that Hawley was \"better at press conferences than the law.\" A little more than a month later, Greitens resigned, retreating to his Warren County lake house.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The episode was striking - two young, conservative outsiders trading barbs.</p><p>But Greitens is not the only person to question Hawley's motivations and effectiveness.</p><p>Adversaries portray Hawley, 38, as a young man in a hurry - someone more interested in headlines than results.</p><p>Hawley points to accomplishments that range from helping to orchestrate a sex trafficking sting in Springfield, Mo., to launching an initiative seeking to link service members with pro bono legal help.</p><p>Now that Hawley is running for U.S. Senate against Democrat Claire McCaskill, his two years as attorney general - the only public office he's ever held - provide the only work sample voters have to judge his effectiveness as an elected leader.</p><p>ACCOMPLISHMENTS</p><p>When he took office in early 2017, Hawley oversaw a chaotic office-wide restructuring that was followed by high turnover, the Post-Dispatch reported Sunday.</p><p>Despite that turnover, Mary Compton, Hawley's spokeswoman, cited several accomplishments, including: settling a lawsuit with the Bridgeton Landfill that Hawley's predecessor filed; collecting a record amount of Medicaid fraud restitution; and earning more than 100 convictions at the trial court level.</p><p>Hawley also settled a decadelong legal battle between blind Missourians and the state over the Blind Pension Fund.</p><p>After reporting by the Columbia Missourian on the state's sexual assault kit testing backlog, Hawley launched an audit of the problem. He documented 5,424 untested kits, though many police agencies did not respond to questions. His office also landed a federal grant to help ease the backlog.</p><p>Hawley said his consumer protection section has obtained $30 million for Missourians; it was not immediately clear how that figure compares to past administrations. He praised his prosecutors for their criminal convictions and successful judgments on appeal.</p><p>\"They often do it at less pay than they could get in the private sector,\" Hawley said in an interview. \"And they're doing a good job.\"</p><p>Hawley's new Federalism Unit took 14 actions to torpedo federal laws and regulations, including the Affordable Care Act, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau and several environmental protections. Some former employees complain the emphasis diverted attention away from more pressing (and less glamorous) state business.</p><p>The attorney general has made other moves that garnered both praise and criticism.</p><p>On Aug. 31, Hawley filed a lawsuit seeking to enjoin Branson Duck Boats and Ripley Entertainment from operating the vehicles in Missouri. In July, 17 people died when a duck boat sank in Table Rock Lake in Branson during a storm.</p><p>The company owners questioned the accuracy of his allegations and insinuated the lawsuit was filed to burnish Hawley's credentials.</p><p>\"The Attorney General's suggestion that BDV and Ripley flouted safety concerns in the name of profits is nothing more than baseless hyperbole, aimed at leveraging and stoking passions in the aftermath of this tragedy in an effort to polish the Attorney General's prosecutorial credentials,\" the companies' attorneys wrote in court documents.</p><p>\"People will fight me, accuse me of things all the time,\" Hawley said. \"I would just say to the Branson duck boat folks - Duck Boat Vehicles and Ripley Entertainment - they better check their rhetoric and take responsibility for their actions, because they've got a long road ahead of them.</p><p>\"I don't want them operating duck boats anywhere in Missouri,\" he added.</p><p>Hawley also has announced several investigations during his tenure, including one into possible Catholic clergy sex abuse, two related to tech companies Google and Facebook and another related to pharmaceutical companies under allegations of opioid pill pushing. He also announced an investigation into Equifax after a data breach last year.</p><p>\"I'm most proud of standing up to the big and powerful on behalf of the people of Missouri - no matter what, no matter who,\" Hawley said. \"We've done that, whether it's big pharma, big tech or organized crime - human traffickers, Medicaid fraudsters.\"</p><p>Hawley sued several pharmaceutical companies last summer. The Google and Facebook investigations are ongoing. His Catholic clergy probe involves potentially hundreds of thousands of documents.</p><p>Joseph Bindbeutel, who served three of Hawley's predecessors, said he was struck by how many times Hawley has publicized his probes.</p><p>\"Those investigations are going to take years to complete,\" Bindbeutel said, referring specifically to the tech probes. \"When you yell them (investigation announcements) from the mountaintops, it makes one wonder, \u2018Is this about yelling from the mountaintops, or is this about doing a straight up, legitimate, thorough investigation of an issue?'\"</p><p>GREITENS' GHOSTS</p><p>Hawley has not updated the public in months on his investigation into Greitens' former charity, The Mission Continues, and whether Greitens or others illegally used charity resources for personal or political gain.</p><p>He was also investigating to see whether Greitens or his staff illegally used taxpayer resources for campaign purposes, but it is unclear where that probe stands.</p><p>Hawley said at an August press gaggle that the probes were ongoing. He has unsurprisingly avoided mention of Greitens on the campaign trail.</p><p>\"Greitens' resignation handed Hawley a great gift,\" said Terry Smith, political science professor at Columbia College. \"I'm sure Claire was really sad when he left office. It was going to be a real albatross.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, two private attorneys have continued to probe the Greitens administration. Elad Gross, a former assistant attorney general under Democrat Chris Koster, sued Greitens' nonprofit, A New Missouri, in June after the dark money group declined to turn over financial information to Gross.</p><p>Gross is sparring with Gov. Mike Parson's office over a $3,618 bill for documents. He sued Parson's administration last week. He also mailed Hawley's office a packet explaining why he thinks Hawley can investigate A New Missouri, but the office still contends it cannot.</p><p>Mark Pedroli, a St. Louis County attorney, sued the Greitens administration in December over Greitens' use of the text-message destroying smartphone app Confide, which he says violated state records retention laws.</p><p>While Pedroli continues to gather evidence that he says shows Greitens and his staff broke the law, Hawley's office said in March it found no evidence of wrongdoing.</p><p>In another case, Hawley used the merchandising practices law to sue the St. Louis Housing Authority and McCormack Baron Management, which both manage the Clinton-Peabody Housing Complex south of downtown St. Louis.</p><p>Hawley alleged in his August lawsuit that the housing authority and McCormack Baron fraudulently marketed complexes as habitable, when, in fact, the units were not. He wants the two entities to return rent payments to tenants.</p><p>Problems at the complex, built in 1942, became widely known after mice invaded the complex last fall. While mice infested an estimated 165 of 358 units last December, the St. Louis Health Department said in August that an estimated six units showed evidence of mice after an inspection that month.</p><p>The housing authority and McCormack Baron have called the lawsuit unhelpful. Cheryl Lovell, director of the authority, said her staff has worked \"tirelessly\" to solve the problems on a shoestring budget. She said Hawley did not meet with the housing authority before filing a lawsuit.</p><p>The housing authority and McCormack Baron also say that Clinton-Peabody has not been able to access federal funds that would allow for interior renovations.</p><p>Hawley says the criticisms sound like \"excuses.\"</p><p>\"We are going to hold them accountable no matter how much they kick and scream and make excuses,\" he said. \"These are people's homes were talking about.\"</p><p>To Hawley's critics, the headline-grabbing announcement was just that: a headline-grabbing announcement. The two sides are not even scheduled to appear in court for an initial review until Nov. 13, after the election.</p><p>\"I think it's more political than anything,\" said Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis. \"He's trying to keep his name out there.\"</p><p>&gt; HAWLEY'S RECORD AS ATTORNEY GENERAL This is the second part of a series examining Josh Hawley's record as attorney general of Missouri.

Its GDP growth has trailed the nation for 20 of the last 22 years. St. Louis is one of America\u2019s fastest-shrinking cities. The labor force is declining, too, by 30,000 people in 2017 alone. Life expectancy fell by more than a year between 2012 and 2018, a decline that the Missouri Department of Health blamed on rising deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is hard to disconnect these facts from the usually purple state\u2019s turnout for Donald Trump in 2016. Trump defeated Hillary Clinton 56% to 38%, beating the Obama-Romney spread by nine points. Missouri was not alone: Across the country, counties suffering spikes in suicide, drug overdose, and alcohol deaths, those with less education, and those facing joblessness were all significantly more likely to vote for Trump.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having branded itself the party of free trade and Big Business, the GOP found itself swept into power on the coattails of a candidate either dismissive of or outright opposed to each. Rather, Trump\u2019s victory came from those voters, including blue-collar Missourians, who felt they have lost out in the economic order many Republicans championed. In the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, therefore, the Republican Party has faced an identity crisis, what some call a \u201crealignment.\u201d</p><p>In this moment, perhaps no man is better positioned to shape the future of conservatism than Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley.</p><p>In 1998, Joshua David Hawley left Lexington, Missouri (pop. 4,500), for Stanford. He majored in history, graduating with highest honors. After a brief interlude teaching, came Yale Law, then a federal clerkship, and finally a year working under Chief Justice John Roberts. By 28, he had written his first book. A stint in private practice was followed by work at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty (where Hawley worked on the Burwell v. Hobby Lobby case), then a professorship at the University of Missouri School of Law. This was all before winning election as Missouri attorney general and then, two years later, the state\u2019s junior senator.</p><p>When Hawley came to Washington in 2018, therefore, he was no stranger to the halls of power. Yet the Senate\u2019s youngest member is a consummate populist, presenting himself as a champion of the working man against the ruling class. In a September floor speech, he blamed America\u2019s \u201cgoverning class\u201d for Missouri\u2019s declining life expectancy, saying that \u201cthe policies it has pursued for decades \u2014 on trade, on immigration, on finance \u2014 have helped drive working people to this crisis.\"</p><p>This rhetoric has been matched by a bevy of bills, although few have become law. In particular, Hawley is known for his war on Silicon Valley, pushing proposals from banning \u201cinfinite scrolling\u201d on websites to prohibiting the sale of video game \u201cloot boxes\u201d (which, for a fee, provide a random, in-game item) to children. This has earned him heterodox popularity, with supporters almost as likely to come from the anti-monopoly Left as the traditionalist Right. </p><p>Virtually everyone agrees, however, that Hawley will be key to building the Right post-Trump. This is, in part, because of his paradoxical status as an elite critic of the elite. But it is also because of Hawley\u2019s philosophical depth, uncharacteristic of a national politician. In speeches and essays, Hawley has outlined a political and metaphysical worldview that may be at the heart of his cross-coalitional appeal.</p><p>Supporters of the nascent \u201crealignment\u201d agree on very little. But an exploration of how Hawley thinks may in turn cast light on how they will come to think and how the rest of the post-Trump GOP may come, in time, to think as well.</p><p>The Middle-Class Republic</p><p>Hawley\u2019s critics might accuse him of that most-Marxist sin: class consciousness. His account of America\u2019s greatness is distinctly concerned with class. As he put it in his maiden speech in the Senate, \u201cThe United States is unique in history, as a Republic governed not by a select elite, but by the working man and woman.\u201d</p><p>Hawley, however, is not talking about class struggle, but justice. As he explained in a 2012 essay in the right-of-center policy journal National Affairs, the \u201cjust\u201d society is one that enables humans to (per Genesis 1:26) have \u201cdominion\u201d over the world around them, exercising \u201cauthority over the created order with the responsibility to tend and care for it.\u201d </p><p>Hawley identifies this notion of justice not only in the Bible, but also in Aristotle. It appears throughout the American tradition, from The Federalist Papers to Lincoln\u2019s belief that slavery was abhorrent because it constituted \u201ca total destruction of self-government.\u201d </p><p>America, to Hawley, is based on this idea of self-government. Here, dominion is available to more than the upper classes, which is why it was America\u2019s working men who, Hawley said in his maiden speech, \u201cexplored a continent, who built the railroads, who opened the West, \u2026 the workers whose labor launched the Industrial Revolution and whose ingenuity made the American economy a marvel of the world.\u201d</p><p>Two Theories of Freedom</p><p>This theory \u2014 call it \u201crepublicanism,\u201d call it \u201cpopulism\u201d \u2014 implies a particular concept of freedom, one which links liberty to self-rule. As Hawley puts it in another National Affairs essay, \u201cparticipation \u2014 in government, and in society \u2014 is itself a form of freedom \u2026 Democratic life is itself liberty.\u201d Freedom means not only lack of coercion but also \u201cpersonal discipline, planning, and hard work\u201d \u2014 that is, stewardship of freedom. This was the same theory propounded by many of the Founders Hawley cites as intellectual influences, including John Adams and James Madison.</p><p>Republican freedom was well-suited to early America, where wide-open spaces gave citizens the opportunity to be independent and productive and forced them to govern collaboratively. In fact, Hawley wrote in 2010, this relatively equitable economic arrangement was widely considered to be a necessary precondition of free government. As such, the great economic realignment of the Industrial Revolution, beginning in the late 19th century, was bound to produce a fundamental upheaval in the republican order.</p><p>\u201cBy the opening decade of the 20th century, \u2026 the yeoman ideal seemed increasingly out of reach, and the link between liberty and self-government less certain,\u201d Hawley wrote. \u201cThe Progressive movement was born of these worries.\u201d </p><p>Out of the Progressive Era emerged \u201ca new liberal synthesis,\u201d articulated, in turn, by Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and FDR. Rather than being participatory, progressivism made government the guarantor of people\u2019s freedom, a concept whose meaning also changed. Gone was republican liberty, replaced by what Hawley might describe as \u201cPelagian\u201d liberty.</p><p>A Christian heresy, Pelagianism is the belief that people are born untainted by original sin, and therefore, salvation is possible through will alone, without God\u2019s grace. As Hawley explained during a May commencement address at King\u2019s College, \u201cPelagius held that the individual possessed a powerful capacity for achievement\u201d because if we can save ourselves, we can do anything. Pelagianism, Hawley argues, is the belief that you can \u201cemancipate yourself from God by creating your own self.\u201d</p><p>It is this \u201cself-creation\u201d that for Hawley constitutes progressive freedom. He points often to the plurality opinion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which claims that \u201cat the heart of liberty is the right to define one\u2019s own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life.\u201d Liberty becomes license, not freedom mediated through self-rule.</p><p>The New Oligarchy</p><p>This might wax academic, but it is foundational to Hawley\u2019s ideological outlook and thus his policy views. Pelagianism, he argues, dominated in the stratified, eugenics-obsessed Progressive Era and today has taken over again. </p><p>\u201cA Pelagian society is one that celebrates the wealthy, prioritizes the powerful, rewards the privileged,\u201d Hawley told the King\u2019s College class of 2019. \u201cFor too long now, that has described modern America.\u201d </p><p>Hawley\u2019s critics again might call this class warfare, but it is more a critique of meritocracy. The perverse implication of Pelagianism is that if salvation is within our power to attain, then anyone who does not is morally inferior. Analogously, in a society where achievement determines status, those who rise to the top, those with a college degree or a white-collar job, are considered valuable, while everyone else is dismissed as worthless. </p><p>The result is the emergence of what Hawley sees as a new elite, aristocracy, and even oligarchy: the tech moguls of Silicon Valley and the Ivy-educated, liberal class in New York and D.C. This elite dismisses \u201cthe plain virtues of patriotism and self-sacrifice, things like humility and faithfulness.\u201d That dismissal, in turn, drives policy.</p><p>\u201cOver the last several decades, American policymakers have increasingly screened out the lives, the needs, the aspirations of working-class and middle-class Americans,\u201d Hawley told the Washington Examiner. \u201cMost people in this country don\u2019t go to a four-year college with a degree; the large majority do not. Most of them don\u2019t want to. Most of them do not want to move 200, 300, 400 miles from where they live. They would like to live with their family in proximity to people they know to have a sense of community. This is the aspiration of the Great American Middle.\"</p><p>These aspirations are not merely preferences. They are consummate examples of republican freedom.</p><p>Strange Bedfellows</p><p>Framed in these terms, Hawley has two legislative goals: dismantling the new aristocracy and supporting the \u201cGreat American Middle.\u201d His war on Big Tech, in particular, is about disempowering an elite that Hawley thinks got rich without creating real value for everyone else. Other bills, such as his proposal to relocate federal agencies throughout the country or his plan for a more dovish monetary policy, are aimed squarely at buoying workers. </p><p>This has not been the Republican Party agenda over the last decade. Consequently, Hawley finds himself with a heterodox set of admirers.</p><p>One of those is Sohrab Ahmari, op-ed editor of the New York Post and a prominent Catholic traditionalist voice in the \u201crealignment.\u201d In March, Ahmari co-signed an open letter in First Things attacking the GOP\u2019s \u201cdead consensus.\u201d The letter reads in part like a Hawley speech, decrying 20th-century conservatism's preoccupation with \u201cindividual autonomy\u201d and insisting that \u201cthe fetishizing of autonomy paradoxically yielded the very tyranny that consensus conservatives claim most to detest.\u201d</p><p>The similarity between Hawley and these new traditionalists is one Ahmari is happy to embrace. He extolled Hawley for invoking Pelagius and told the Washington Examiner, \"If you listen to his speeches, and you read his op-eds, he gets this [critique]. He gets it at a philosophical level.\u201d At the same time, Ahmari explained, Hawley\u2019s rhetorical approach lets him go places that his fellow traditionalists cannot.</p><p>\u201cHe is formulating this critique of our current model and our current arrangement,\u201d Ahmari said, \u201cbut he\u2019s doing it in a vernacular and a language that is deeply, deeply American, and he does it in a way that First Things manifesto writers can\u2019t always achieve.\u201d</p><p>Then there\u2019s the other side of the political horseshoe. Matthew Stoller, a self-identified liberal, is a leading advocate for \u201chipster antitrust,\u201d targeting Big Tech (among others) with antitrust tools. For Stoller and his left-leaning compatriots, Hawley looks like an unlikely ally. Speaking to the Washington Examiner, Stoller explained that their common ground comes in large part from Hawley\u2019s philosophical views.</p><p>\u201cHe is rejecting libertarianism and the neoliberal framework for organizing our economy and our society,\u201d Stoller said. \u201cHe\u2019s saying some things should not be commodified: a sense of place, of rootedness, of church, of family. These are things that should not be commodified.\u201d</p><p>Hawley, Stoller said, is going further than his Senate colleagues who have criticized Big Tech simply for alleged bias (a criticism Hawley has also leveled). By contrast, \u201con political economy, [Hawley and I] see the same threats,\u201d whether it is China or Big Tech: \u201cconcentrated power.\u201d </p><p>Perhaps because of this, Hawley and Stoller are on a similar page when it comes to freedom, too.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s this old way to understand liberty, which is that liberty means the ability to govern one's self, and through that to govern one\u2019s society,\u201d Stoller said. \u201cIn the 1960s, we began confusing liberty with license. \u2026 That is not traditionally what liberty meant.\u201d</p><p>Neither Stoller nor Ahmari are perfect ideological duplicates of Hawley. But that is part of what makes the senator so peculiar: He attracts allies who might never agree otherwise, except on their shared skepticism of \u201cautonomy,\u201d or \u201cneoliberalism,\u201d or perhaps, \u201cPelagianism.\u201d</p><p>Familiar Foes</p><p>As traditionalists cheer him and some on the Left warm to him, Hawley has simultaneously become one of the libertarian Right\u2019s greatest foes. Once ascendant, small-government libertarianism is increasingly out of fashion under the conservative big tent.</p><p>\u201cI don't like a lot of these ideas,\u201d Robby Soave, associate editor for Reason magazine, told the Washington Examiner, \u201cbut I can recognize when I\u2019m not winning.\u201d</p><p>Soave, who called Hawley\u2019s agenda \u201cBloomberg-esque,\u201d thinks the senator is doing more meddling than liberating.</p><p>\u201cI think he believes that we should use the power of the state to make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d Soave said. \u201cWe should not simply get the state out of people\u2019s lives so they can make decisions for themselves, but we can improve on their situation by telling people what they ought to do or what they ought not to do.\u201d</p><p>Other, less libertarian conservatives make a similar argument. </p><p>\u201cAs long as consumers retain the ability to make their own choices, big companies tend to correct,\u201d Kent Lassman, president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the Washington Examiner. \u201cWhen you get government involved setting a policy \u2026 you take away the agency from consumers, and you give the agency to government regulators, which tend to be very inflexible. They don\u2019t adapt to new entrants; they don\u2019t adapt to new technologies.\u201d</p><p>For Lassman, much of Hawley\u2019s legislation crosses a line for conservatives who oppose the federal government making choices for individuals.</p><p>\u201cConservatism is rooted in the ability of individuals to chart their own path,\u201d Lassman said, adding that he meant \u201cthe individual or the small-business owner or the person deciding about their investment in their education for their family; I\u2019m talking about individual decisions made vis-\u00e0-vis the state, vis-\u00e0-vis the law.\u201d</p><p>Lassman and Soave represent a long-standing view on the Right: Government action is almost always another step down the road to serfdom. Hawley would almost certainly say he sympathizes; he told the Washington Examiner that he wants government to empower communities, not direct them itself.</p><p>But that gets to the heart of the dispute surrounding Hawley. In the 21st century, is it enough for government to get out of the way? In the Silicon Age, does freedom require more than noncoercion?</p><p>The People's Party</p><p>Hawley is often labeled a populist. Asked about the original Populist Party, he noted that the era in which that peculiar alliance arose was \u201ca moment in history that\u2019s very similar to our own in many ways.\u201d </p><p>\u201cIt was a moment of significant social, economic, international upheaval, which we\u2019re experiencing now as well,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cThe late 19th, early 20th century was also a moment when the existing political coalitions were in a state of collapse and reforming, which is clearly what we\u2019re in the midst of right now.\"</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been a middle-class democracy from the very first, and that I think has really shaped the character of the country,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think the Populists reflect that, \u2026 and I think we\u2019re struggling with that today.\u201d</p><p>Just as the Progressive Era was spawned by destabilization, Hawley thinks a similar destabilization \u2014 unfettered trade, Big Tech, and free-market fundamentalism \u2014 is behind the plight of voters such as those Missourians who backed Trump. Opponents disagree, insisting that the sickness is thanks to the government overreach they think Hawley wants more of.</p><p>Time will tell who\u2019s right. What is clear is that, in the meantime, the realignment will be a battle of philosophies as much as politics, and one side knows who its champion is.</p><p>Charles Fain Lehman is a staff writer for the Washington Free Beacon, where he covers social issues and policy.</p><p>Photo Caption:Joshua David Hawley is a consummate populist, presenting himself as a champion of the working man against the ruling class.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2325260079</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR8-WSG1-DY0W-4268-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

'What's that?' Laney asked, indicating the man on stilts. 'A sect,' Arleigh McCrae said. ''New Logic.' They say the world will end when the combined weight of all the human nervous tissue on the planet reaches a specific figure. </p><p>[As a musician,] Rez was interested in them, apparently. He tried to arrange an audience with the founder.' 'And?' 'The founder declined. He said that Rez made his living through the manipulation of human nervous tissue, and that that made him untouchable.' \u2014 William Gibson, Idoru I've been looking for a way to write about gaming \u2014 I'm so old I associate 'gaming' with a family-friendly Vegas rebranding of 'gambling' \u2014 and just the other day I finally found an opening. Oddly, a Republican Senator, Josh Hawley, provided it in the form of the following YouTube video (recommended by Stoller[1]). It's only about fifteen minutes long, and its worth a listen: [embedded content] This article in First Things ('The Big Tech Threat[2]') is not a transcript, but does seem to be the original from which Hawley delivered his speech. In relevant part:It is heresy to say that here, with Stanford University over my shoulder, but is Silicon Valley\u2014the platforms, the products, the business models it has been giving us of late\u2014really the best that our best minds have to offer? My thesis is that the evidence strongly suggests there is something deeply troubling, maybe even deeply wrong, with the entire social media economy. My thesis is that it does not represent a source of strength for America's tomorrow, but is rather a source of peril. Consider for a moment the basic business model of the dominant social media platforms. You are familiar with them. You might think of it as akin to financial arbitrage. Maybe we'll call it attention arbitrage. Users' attention is bought by tech giants and then immediately sold to advertisers for the highest price.  Now arbitrage opportunities, as those of you familiar with markets know, are supposed to close. The market eventually determines that something is off. So how is it that this attention arbitrage in the social media market is preserved and renewed over and over again? That's where things get really scary, because it's preserved by hijacking users' neural circuitry to prevent rational decision-making about what to click and how to spend time. Or, to simplify that a little bit, it's preserved through addiction.  Social media only works as a business model if it consumes users' time and attention day after day after day. It needs to replace the various activities we did perfectly well without social media, for the entire known history of the human race, with itself. It needs to replace those activities with time spent on social media. Addiction is actually the point. That's what social media shareholders are investing in: the addiction of users.Now, I should caveat that since I came up as a Democrat, I know only a little more about Republicans than I know about gaming; I don't know their factions, I don't know their districts, I don't know their rising stars or old bovines, I don't know how they fit into Ferguson, Jorgensen, and Chen's industrial structure[3], or much else. (Yes, ME-02 is Republican, but not my town, and in any case ME-02 is cranky.) Obviously, I'm going to have to write at a high level, as they say, because on this topic there's no other level I can wiite at! That said, I think Hawley has the right of it here, and his concision is admirable. It also took some courage for him to come into the Hoover Institute, an outpost of Stanford, where so many Silicon Valley founders were spawned incubated, and tell them their business models are morally wrong. Certainly, I would disagree with him on much else, but not on this. Oddly, or not, I don't recall any West Coast Democrats doing what Hawley did here (see Ferguson et al., supra). So in this brief post I'll look first at Hawley's solution to the social media problem he names, then at two UI/UX practices that monetize addition (loot boxes and pay-to-win), and finally at the larger social issues to which Hawley points (or does not point). I'll throw together some random comments about Hawley qua Republican Senator from Missouri in an Appendix. 'The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act' Hawley's bill is named 'The Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act' (PCAGA), but as of this writing it has not yet been introduced[4], so I can't tell you who the co-sponsors, if any, are. Hawley has, however, provided a one-pager[5]:Senator Hawley's legislation would apply new consumer protections to games played by minors including: \u2022 Games targeted at those under the age of 18. \u2022 This would be determined by subject matter, visual content, and other indicators similar to those used to determine applicability of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) \u2022 Games with wider audiences whose developers knowingly allow minor players to engage in microtransactionsAnd from McClatchy, Hawley[6]: 'When a game is designed for kids, game developers shouldn't be allowed to monetize addiction,' Hawley said in a statement announcing the bill. 'And when kids play games designed for adults, they should be walled off from compulsive microtransactions. Game developers who knowingly exploit children should face legal consequences.' My concern here is that the problem and the solution are disproportionate; the addiction ('attention arbitrage') problem encompasses an entire industry and affects the whole of society; and yet the PCAGA solution protects only children. (I have the same problem with some of Elizabeth Warren's proposals[7].) Do adults not have the same moral claims? Particularly since many adults are caregivers to children? The parallel to the opioid epidemic is exact, with the Sacklers in the role of Silicon Valley. Or cigarettes. Now it is true, as Hawley says of a parallel bill during the Q...eriod in the video, that this is 'a place we can begin immediately,' but I have the sense that the mountain has brought forth a mouse without even laboring. So, more like this, please.  Loot Boxes and Pay-to-Win Still from the one-pager, the PCAGA would prohibit two forms of 'manipulative design'[1]: Loot Boxes \u2022 Microtransactions offering randomized or partially randomized rewards to players Pay-to-Win Pay-to-win \u2022 Manipulation of a game's progression system - typically by building artificial difficulty or other barriers into game progression - to induce players to spend money on microtransactions to advance through content supposedly available to them at no additional cost \u2022 Pay-to-win - Manipulation of the competitive balance between players of multiplayer games by allowing players who purchase microtransactions competitive advantages over other players Here is an example of a 'loot box' From ParentZone[8]: The game Overwatch offers players the chance to buy loot boxes in randomised bundles with prices starting at 1.50 for two loot boxes going up to 30 for 50 boxes. But when a player purchases each bundle they're not paying for the items within the loot box, but rather the chance of getting something worth using in the game. The probability of a player's loot box containing anything of actual value is not shown and so there is no idea of knowing the odds of winning (So loot boxes, despite industry protestations[9], are gambing, especially if the game includes money and a secondary market where loot can be resold. And just as in Vegas, it's the random element that hooks the user[10]: 'We know that when there is randomization people are more enticed to open more boxes and get more things. We've been using that idea for decades in things like card packs. What's a bit different with games is that the dematerialization of money removes a barrier. When you buy a card pack as a kid, you need to ask your parents for physical money and the transaction is very concrete. When money is not physical anymore, it's way easier for people to buy it without the moment where you see the money leaving your pocket. It's harder to stop yourself,' [Epic Games UX Director Celia Hodent] said. And likewise of 'pay-to-win[11]': [P]retty much the entire mobiles games industry is built on the principle of pay-to-win in a much more blatant way. Pretty much all the most popular mobile titles in the world have some way to pay to 'advance,' whether that's buying lives in Candy Crush, buying chests in Clash Royale, buying raid passes in Pokmon GO, paying to skip wait timers inliterally everything. It will not have escaped the reader that these dark patterns in games are very much like, well, the dark patterns in Our Neoliberal Democracy. For example, a college degree is a loot box. You pay a lot for it, but you don't really know what's in it, and there's a strong random element to what you get. And speaking of college, 'pay-to-win' is what happened in the Varsity Blue admissions corruption case[12], isn't it? Beyond Neoliberal Gaming Hawley concludes his speech this way, again from First Things[13]:An economy that does not value the things that matter produces a society shaped in its own image. That, I want to suggest to you, is something that we cannot afford. It is something that we cannot allow, and it is within our power to change it. And that is the great challenge and task of our time. I think it is incumbent upon all of us, as we consider the place that we're in now, as we consider the new era that we're living in\u2014particularly those of us who believe in free markets, in the free and open economy\u2014to be asking ourselves: What kind of economy are we encouraging? What kind of a society is that producing? And what is our responsibility, as members of that society, to shape it in the best way for the future? What is clear is that Hawley believes that the economy of attention arbitrage produced by the social media 'platforms' is a form of social engineering somehow inimical to free markets. Some would disagree; above I broached the idea that loot boxes and pay-to-win mirror the 'free market' society that already surrounds us \u2014 and which hatched and grew decades before personal computers, let alone gaming platforms, developed. What I would like to suggest is that other forms of gaming are possible. I've been slowly and intermittently reading Jared Diamond's The World Until Yesterday Here (page 91) is a game: The anthropologist Jane Goodale watched a group of children (the Kaulong people of New Britain) who hd been given a bunch of bananas suffcieint to provide one banana for each child. The children proceeded to play a game. Instead of a contest in which each child soich ti win the biggest banana, each child cut his/her banana into two equal halves, ate one half, offered the other half to another child, and in turn recieved half that child's banana. Then each child proceeded to cut that uneaten half of the banana into two equal quarters, ate one of the quarters, offered the other quarter to another child, and recieved another child's uneaten banana in return. The game went on for five cycles, as the residual piece of banana was broken into equal eighths, then equal sixteenths, until finally each child ate the stub representing the one-thirty-second of the of the original banana, gave the other thirty-second to another child to eat, and received and ate the last thirty-second of another banana from still another child. That whole play ritual was part of the practicing by which New Guinea children learn to shar, and not to seek an advantage for themselves. No loot boxes or pay-to-win at all.[2] Can't we have games like that?[3] And if the platforms are doing to do social engineering, regardless, could we perhaps nudge them a more co-operative, and less vicious and greedy direction? NOTES [1] A.k.a. dark patterns[14]. 'Dark Patterns are tricks used in websites and apps that make you do things that you didn't mean to, like buying or signing up for something. The purpose of this site is to spread awareness and to shame companies that use them.' Leaving open the question of whether the addict means to satisfy their addition. [2] Not to idealize New Guinea. Diamond makes clear they could play First Person Shooter games all day long. [3] I'm trying to work through how to introduce a dark pattern into the banana game. I'm not sure it's possible with the rules as they are. Readers? Appendix: Random Notes on Josh Hawley (1) The right people dislike Hawley. Like Obama's speechwriter: Ugh, Josh Hawley is insufferable.  What a giant step down from @clairecmc[15] - Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) May 1, 2019[16]Claire McCaskill? Really? (2) Hawley is also after Google. Ars Technica[17]:'There is strong reason to believe that Google has not been acting with the best interest of Missourians in mind,' Hawley said in a November 2017 statement. 'When a company has access to as much consumer information as Google does, it's my duty to ensure they are using it appropriately. I will not let Missouri consumers and businesses be exploited by industry giants.' In addition to exploring privacy concerns, Hawley also vowed to dig into potentially anti-competitive behavior\u2014including 'Google's alleged manipulation of search results to preference websites owned by Google and to demote websites that compete with Google.' Hawley's stance has been particularly surprising\u2014and ominous for Google\u2014because Hawley is a Republican. Republicans have traditionally been more friendly to big business and skeptical of privacy and antitrust regulation. But Hawley's success is just the latest sign that attitudes on the right may be shifting.(Note that Hawley is willing to name names, very much unlike Cory Booker and Kamala Harris[18]. (3) Hawley is Peter Thiel-adjacent[19]:Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley's office would not directly answer Wednesday when asked whether his investigation into Google had any connection to campaign donations from billionaire Peter Thiel, a high-profile critic of the company. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and early Facebook investor, donated $300,000 to Hawley's campaign for attorney general in 2015 and 2016, a fact first noted by Bloomberg[20]. Thiel previously donated to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who brought an anti-trust action against Google as Texas attorney general[21] in 2010.(4) Here's the About page on Hawley's Senate campaign site[22]. Much to ponder.<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/josh-hawley-r-mo-and-how-the-social-media-economy-addicts-users.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#\">https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2019/05/josh-hawley-r-mo-and-how-the-social-media-economy-addicts-users.html?utm_source=feedburner..._medium=feed..._campaign=Feed:+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#</url> ;This entry was posted in Guest Post[23], Politics[24], Social values[25], Technology and innovation[26] on May 13, 2019[27] by Lambert Strether[28].  About Lambert StretherReaders, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism ('Because markets'). I don't much care about the 'ism' that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don't much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue \u2014 and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me \u2014 is the tens of thousands of excess 'deaths from despair,' as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics \u2014 even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton's wars created \u2014 bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow \u2014 currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press \u2014 a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let's call such voices 'the left.' Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn't allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I've been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it.

Josh Hawley\u2019s radical new bill would overhaul, empower, and politicize the Federal Trade Commission in the name of reeling in Big Tech \u2014 and it\u2019s you, the user, who would suffer for it. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Missouri Republican\u2019s unprecedented legislation merges the FTC with the Department of Justice, while replacing its five commissioners with a single Senate appointee and giving state attorneys general the power to prosecute companies using FTC regulations. It\u2019s the latest chapter in the populist crusade against the tech industry being waged by regulation friendly Republicans and Democrats alike, due to Big Tech\u2019s perceived bias and alleged monopolistic, anti-competitive behavior. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cThe FTC isn\u2019t working,\u201d Hawley claims. \u201cIt wastes time in turf wars with the DOJ, nobody is accountable for decisions, and it lacks the \u2018teeth\u2019 to get after Big Tech\u2019s rampant abuses.\u201d </p><p>Thus far, Hawley isn\u2019t totally wrong. </p><p>The FTC and the DOJ do often waste time and resources squabbling over which agency is best equipped to pursue anti-trust lawsuits. Hawley\u2019s bill offers an outcome that would resolve the delays. And while the FTC has levied hefty fines, such as its $5 billion settlement with Facebook last year over data and privacy violations, some have criticized these settlements for not denting companies\u2019 bottom lines enough to drive change.</p><p>But turning the independent commission into a politicized lapdog of the executive branch of government isn\u2019t the answer. </p><p>We\u2019ve already seen the morass and partisanship prompted by Senate appointments to executive leadership roles. The current FTC structure of five independent commissioners helps keep politics out of the agency and ensure that it sticks with its mandate: to uphold consumer welfare while taking a sensible light touch regulatory approach that encourages innovation.</p><p>And while Hawley\u2019s intent may be to reassert conservative interests, it\u2019s in fact conservatives who have the most to lose from partisan appointments. </p><p>Democrats such as Joe Biden have repeatedly threatened social media sites with punitive legislation over their failure to adequately censor \u201cfake news\u201d \u2014 while almost exclusively citing examples of conservative content. And with five-year appointments, Hawley\u2019s proposal would come back to bite conservatives as soon as a Democratic president takes power and empowers the FTC to punish conservative content. </p><p>The same goes for undermining the FTC\u2019s independence by subsuming it under the DOJ and giving state attorneys general the power to use FTC regulations to pursue politically motivated cases. Politicians, including Hawley, already make it a point to notch up career wins by targeting the Big Tech bogeymen. Any costs borne by firms due to increased litigation or greater regulatory burdens are likely to be paid for down the chain by consumers and businesses reliant on digital services.</p><p>Rather than combating the biggest firms\u2019 monopolies, this will just entrench them. </p><p>Tech giants are best equipped to weather protracted litigation and regulation, which disproportionately impacts smaller firms and startups trying to compete. Some CEOs, such as Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, have even openly asked to be regulated more strictly. And a harsher regulatory environment will only deter investors from taking \u201crisky bets\u201d on new or smaller competitors, chilling innovation.</p><p>The FTC largely does a good job because of its independence and because it embraces the \u201cconsumer welfare standard\u201d \u2014 that predominant market share alone doesn\u2019t make a company bad, it\u2019s only a problem if consumers are being harmed. Transferring responsibilities to state attorneys general, as Hawley proposes, would hand power over to those unconcerned with this standard. State attorneys general may benefit politically from merely appearing tough on Big Tech, regardless of whether their actions help or hurt consumers. They face dangerous incentives. </p><p>Yes, the FTC does have problems, and the tech industry isn\u2019t perfect. But turning the FTC into another arm of the already overpowered executive branch isn\u2019t the answer \u2014 and it would just backfire on conservatives, to boot.</p><p>Satya Marar (@MisterJEET) is a Washington DC-based Policy Analyst at Reason Foundation and a contributor to the Washington Examiner\u2019s Beltway Confidential blog.</p><p>Photo Caption:n this April 4, 2019, file photo, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee member Josh Hawley, R-Mo., listens to witnesses during the Committee's hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2354006215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6H-3861-JBHT-D15H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

But what does Josh Hawley, the freshman Republican senator from Missouri, choose to focus on? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ending Snapchat streaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Tuesday, Hawley introduced a bill to \u201ccurb social media addiction,\u201d a problem that the supposed small government conservative apparently sees as important enough to warrant massive state intervention. His proposed legislation would regulate social media\u2019s \u201caddictive\u201d qualities, which means no more Snapchat streaks, no more infinite scrolling down Twitter and Facebook, no more YouTube autoplay, and so on. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clearly, Hawley isn\u2019t addressing the problems that matter.</p><p>Hawley\u2019s bill would make it illegal for social media companies to create what he calls a \u201cbusiness model of addiction\u201d \u2014 also known as a product so good people want to keep using it. Social media use is a personal choice, and regulating Big Tech is a ludicrous example of big government controlling things they have no business getting involved in. </p><p>And suggesting that \u201caddictive\u201d features such as being able to scroll as long as you\u2019d like or starting a \u201cstreak\u201d with your friends on Snapchat creates a culture of addiction is absurd. Worse, forcing companies to end features users enjoy in favor of things like timers showing how long you\u2019ve been on a website is foolish and paternalistic. If consumers want to regulate how much time we spend on social media, it\u2019s not hard to look up at the clock.</p><p>Still, it\u2019s no secret that Hawley isn\u2019t a fan of social media. </p><p>In a USA Today op-ed, the senator questioned whether social media really was valuable at all, and suggested we would be \u201cbetter off if Facebook disappeared.\u201d Even if we generously assume that\u2019s true, it doesn\u2019t matter, it isn\u2019t the government\u2019s job to decide that for us or regulate things like social media. It\u2019s up to the users themselves to determine if they would like to use social media, and how much time they spend on the platforms. </p><p>And Hawley\u2019s assumption that social media use is something to be \u201cfixed\u201d is, in and of itself, flawed. </p><p>Hawley has a point that social media \u201ccapture[s] far more of our attention than [it] used to.\u201d But this isn\u2019t objectively a bad thing, and if Hawley is so against social media, he can make the same choice that thousands of others make to not use these services. Yet others see value in them, and it\u2019s easy to see why. </p><p>Sure, social media has impacted the way we interact with each other in society. We could even go so far as to say it\u2019s changed society as a whole \u2014 we communicate via text, get news from Twitter and Facebook, and have opportunities to meet new people and stay in touch with loved ones like never before. </p><p>And take the success of GoFundMe, a platform that is used to raise money for those in need. GoFundMe campaigns are often shared on Twitter and Facebook, and have raised over $5 billion for people in need. </p><p>The bottom line is that while it may be true that social media is changing how we interact as a society, change isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. We are more connected than ever before: journalists can share articles far and wide, people can get instant news updates, and loved ones can talk to each other from halfway across the world. Even if there are harms, we all voluntarily choose to engage, or not engage, in social media use. </p><p>Josh Hawley needs to realize that the government has much bigger problems to solve.</p><p>Jordan Lancaster is a contributor to Red Alert Politics and a senior at Wake Forest University.

Impeachment hearings are proceeding dramatically in the House. Donald Trump has taken to <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196832113447845889?s=20\">tweeting videos</url> about the purported \"coup\" being staged against his presidency by Democrats, complete with an ominous musical score. But from the view of Senator Josh Hawley's office, its walls covered in tasteful kid art and a large desk offering up a mugful of crisp yellow pencils, it's hard to tell that anything is amiss. The Missouri freshman is too busy laying out the future of the Republican Party to pay much mind to the partisan death spiral unfolding around him.</p><p><br/>By Hawley's own account, some conservatives on Capitol Hill have spent the past three years with their eyes tightly shut, waiting for the Trump era to pass and everything to return to normal. \"That's not going to happen,\" he told me in an interview this week. If the Republican Party returns to its pre-Trump ideological defaults-standing up for big business over the middle class, prioritizing free-market principles over social issues-\"we're not going to be a majority party, ever,\" he said. \"That's just not the future.\"<br/>Hawley, 39, became the youngest member of the Senate after a 2018 upset victory over a powerful Democratic incumbent, Claire McCaskill, and he has quickly vaulted himself to prominence in Washington's elite conservative circles. Along with Senate Republicans such as Ted Cruz, and ex-Trump-administration officials such as Nikki Haley, his name is frequently floated as a potential lead architect of Trumpism after Trump. His speeches around town, including one he delivered on Tuesday evening while accepting an award at <url normalizedValue=\"https://appfdc.org/about/\">the annual gala of the</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://appfdc.org/about/\">American Principles Project</url>Foundation, a socially conservative public-policy organization, are bracingly defiant of Republican orthodoxy: He rails against income inequality, condemns the policy deference afforded to corporations, and speaks warmly about the civic value of labor unions. He often talks about the \"great American middle\" being crushed by the decline of local communities, the winner-take-all concentration of wealth, and the inaccessibility of higher education. And he said that the modern Republican Party's split over competing impulses toward free-market economics and social conservatism has led some conservatives to ignore the effects of their policies on the middle and working class. \"It's time to do away with that,\" he told me.<br/>Trump began the work of redirecting the GOP by building a working-class coalition, Hawley argues. In his view, Trump's bombastic style and penchant for chaos bear no consequence for the new brand of conservatism Hawley envisions; affairs like impeachment amount to ephemeral antics. \"For all of us who are in public office, and especially for those of us who are younger, this isn't the work of a day or a season,\" Hawley told me. \"This is the work of a generation.\"<br/>In many ways, Hawley's brand of populism follows a familiar playbook. He peppers speeches with phrases like \"the rise of a new oligarchy,\" and he leans into his small-town Missouri upbringing in interviews. But he bears an elite pedigree: His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes degrees from Stanford and Yale, a leadership role in Yale's chapter of the Federalist Society, the elite conservative legal group, and a clerkship for Chief Justice John Roberts. Before he got into politics, he worked for Becket, the D.C.-based religious-liberty law firm, and was part of the victorious legal team in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court decision that allowed certain religious exemptions from the contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act.<br/>While many Republicans have tried to sell themselves as populists, Hawley has adopted unusual language for talking about his economic views. He is totally comfortable citing statistics popular on the progressive left:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2019017pap.pdf\">the fact that 70 percent of American wealth</url> is held by the top 10 percent of households, according to the Federal Reserve, or that working-class wages       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/\">have stagnated</url> compared with the rapid wage growth among top earners. When I asked him whether he sees himself as a Bernie Sanders or a Donald Trump-style politician, he laughed loudly-for all of Hawley's rhetoric, he's nowhere near a flirtation with socialism. But he clearly admires the work of upsetting the political order. In his 2008 book on Theodore Roosevelt, Hawley wrote approvingly that the former president \"talked as a conservative, but harbored the political ambitions of a radical.\"<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/national-conservatism-conference/594202/?utm_source=feed\">Read: The nationalists take Washington</url>]<br/>Hawley's economic views are set apart from the left in part by his diagnosis of America's problems. He sees social isolation and the erosion of local communal life-including church, family, neighborhoods, and labor unions-as intimately tied to declining economic opportunity for the middle class. \"Economic policy and our communities and neighborhoods sit right together. They're really intertwined,\" Hawley told me.<br/>And unlike most Democrats, Hawley argues that cultural pathologies have helped create this fractured political moment, particularly the cult of individualism that he says drives everything from public policy to pop culture. In a vision of America in which liberty is primarily about unlimited personal freedom, he said in his speech to the American Principles Project Foundation, \"place and home don't matter much, and civic participation is beside the point.\" This same vision produces \"economic policy focused on individual advancement, where advancement means making more money and consuming more stuff,\" he said, according to his prepared remarks. \"So in popular culture, billionaires become heroes, and the everyday working man becomes just some guy who never realized his potential.\"<br/>It's no small irony that Hawley credits the start of the conservative populist revolution to a man who has spent his career       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/magazine/donald-trump-american-preacher.html\">crafting his image as a glamorous billionaire</url>. The Missouri senator is willing to obliquely criticize some of Trump's policies. Hawley defended Trump's 2017 tax cuts, which radically lowered the corporate tax rate, while he was campaigning for his Senate seat. But now that he's in office, Hawley told me, he would want to give any similar proposals \"a lot of scrutiny.\" Since the tax bill passed two years ago, evidence suggests that some large companies       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html\">have enjoyed a</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html\">zero-percent</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/how-fedex-cut-its-tax-bill-to-0.html\">effective tax rate while making few investments in workers</url>. \"It is amazing how many of these major companies pay no taxes in the United States,\" Hawley said. \"We've lost out on companies moving jobs overseas. We've lost out on them hiring workers at ever-lower wages in this country. And we've lost out from the lack of taxes being paid.\"<br/>As for Trump himself, however, Hawley is an unapologetic supporter. He says that insofar as the president's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/09/donald-trump-and-the-politics-of-fear/498116/?utm_source=feed\">rhetoric is focused on voters' fears</url>-mirroring Hawley's own speeches about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/08/28/feature/a-conservative-senators-crusade-against-big-tech/\">media censorship</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPAUQKY9Jyw\">the menace of cosmopolitan elites</url>-\"you have to acknowledge where people are,\" including their anger and anxiety. He waved away the insults that freely flow from Trump's Twitter feed about       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196425921802178560?s=20\">\"crazy\"</url> House Speaker Nancy Pelosi or       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1193896275093184512?s=20\">\"shifty\"</url> Adam Schiff, the California congressman leading the impeachment hearings. \"The president [is] commenting in an adversarial way on people who are trying to remove him from office,\" Hawley said. His behavior \"is both understandable and doesn't necessarily say anything more, I think, about broader policies, issues, vision.\" The impeachment process has been \"clownish\" and \"reeks of politics,\" he said, and he doesn't think any information about the president's conduct that has come out so far is \"remotely impeachable.\" He wants Trump elected to a second term in 2020, and believes it will happen.<br/>Unlike some of his peers in Congress, however, he doesn't think Republicans should simply try to clone Trump. \"His style is uniquely him,\" Hawley said. \"The people who try to imitate that will come off looking like cheap imitators.\" Instead, Trump's enduring legacy will be in laying the groundwork for a long-term shift in Republican vision and strategy.<br/>[      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/06/first-things-nationalism-trump/592996/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Imagining post-Trump nationalism</url>]<br/>Hawley has successfully positioned himself as a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://nationalconservatism.org/presenters/josh-hawley/\">potential leader for this new movement</url>, at least in Washington. He sells himself as an ideas guy, casually citing the philosopher Edmund Burke and the Christian monk Pelagius in a single stretch. In his first year in office, he has broken with his GOP colleagues on a number of issues, including       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/08/28/feature/a-conservative-senators-crusade-against-big-tech/\">proposing</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/magazine/wp/2019/08/28/feature/a-conservative-senators-crusade-against-big-tech/\">regulations</url> on big tech companies such as Facebook and Google and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/us/politics/josh-hawley-neomi-rao-abortion.html\">challenging the nomination</url> of a D.C. Circuit Court judge,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/trump-nominates-rao-replace-kavanaugh-dc-court/576535/?utm_source=feed\">Neomi Rao</url>, whom he deemed insufficiently pro-life. (These moves       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/06/josh-hawley-internet-censorship-bill-unconstitutional/\">have attracted</url> a fair amount of controversy, including from Hawley's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/02/25/conservative-ad-campaign-neomi-rao-1185309\">fellow conservatives</url>.)<br/>But he also easily switches into electoral mode, making folksy references to his family's long history of involvement with farm co-ops. His ambition is apparent: During his run for Missouri attorney general in 2016, he released an ad criticizing the \"career politicians just climbing the ladder\" in Jefferson City, the state's capital. A little more than a year later, he       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/hawley-officially-says-he-ll-run-for-senate-gets-quick/article_e3732d40-5c27-5920-b7e3-ddbe0d641ffc.html\">announced his intention</url> to run for the United States Senate,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/us/politics/josh-hawley-missouri-senate.html\">with encouragement from national leaders</url> such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He gave me an aww, shucks chuckle and a standard denial when I asked him if he planned to run for president in 2024 or beyond. But he probably doesn't mind social conservatives' dreamy whispers about his potential future.<br/>\"We must forge in this century a new politics of family and neighborhood, a new politics of love and belonging, a new politics of home,\" he said in his speech this week. \"That will mean rethinking old positions and revisiting old orthodoxies. It will mean challenging the old priorities of the political class.\" In this particular moment in the nation's history, \"a new politics of love and belonging\" seems about as distant a prospect as Trump giving friendly testimony to the House Democrats who want to impeach him. (It's also not a particularly Trumpian sentiment, no matter how much Hawley may admire the president.) But this is the moment Hawley's been handed, and he's going to do what he can to carve out a leading role in what comes next. As he said in his speech, \"we cannot wait any longer.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ATLNOL-joshhawleytrumpismgop602365</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ATLNOL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKD-86J1-JCG7-V2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">414070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Atlantic Monthly Group, Inc.

Hawley proposes replacing the FTC's five-member commission with a single Director, who would report directly to the Associate Attorney General in the Department of Justice (DOJ). His plan would also give the FTC more authority to impose civil fines for first-time offenses and allow state attorneys general to exercise concurrent authority to go after companies themselves. Each of these proposals would expand the FTC's power considerably and make businesses, large or small, in almost every sector of the US economy more susceptible to politicized enforcement of antitrust and competition law. For Sen. </p><p>Hawley, politicizing American competition policy to take on 'Big Tech' is exactly the point. He believes social media operators like Facebook and Twitter have enabled[2] 'some of the worst of America,' and he has admonished the current FTC's approach to the tech sector for being 'toothless[3].' In his plan, Hawley accuses the FTC of being 'in no shape to ensure competition in today's markets, let alone tomorrow's' and condemns it for having 'stood by as actors in digital markets violated the law to obtain monopoly power.' Clearly, this proposal is not out of character for Hawley, who has introduced legislation[4] specifically aimed at combating 'social media addiction,' but it does show how willing he is to massively expand the size and scope of government power, just to go after a few companies he disfavors. Principled advocates of limited government and free markets should oppose Hawley's plan. The FTC has significant, vague, and broad authority to regulate the vast majority of the economy, with a few narrow carveouts. The agency also has significant discretion to determine its own jurisdiction, as well as what constitutes[5] 'unfair methods of competition' and 'unfair or deceptive acts or practices.' This is precisely why Congress tried to cabin the power that the FTC can exercise. Congress made the FTC an independent agency headed by a five-person commission, only three of which can be from the same party. The goal was to insulate them from the political whims of one particular party that may be in charge at any given time. Otherwise, the FTC could very well be used as a regulatory hammer to smash political rivals. The reason Congress created procedural safeguards and gave the FTC limited ability to impose civil penalties for a first violation was that, despite its limited rulemaking authority and responsibility to enforce certain statutes, much of its legal principles come from ad hoc enforcement and the precedent it creates. Often, the FTC doesn't know if something is a violation until it actually happens. As such, Congress confined the FTC so that companies would have to notice that something is illegal before facing large fines and penalties. But Hawley's proposals would substantially undermine both of these safeguards that Congress wisely put in place. Instead, the FTC's significant power would be placed in one individual under the executive's thumb who would be given the authority to impose steep civil penalties on companies for behavior they did not even know was illegal. It would also give states a far greater ability to go after companies themselves, even if the FTC refused. This would constitute a major expansion of government power, giving the president and state executive officers a dangerous tool to punish those they disfavor. While supporters of Hawley's plan may applaud such an idea when the Trump Administration can carry out its priorities, imagine the outrage and scandal that would result from the same authority being placed in a Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders appointee. Hawley's plan may not be surprising, given his disdain for large tech companies, but it is very telling. It shows just how easy it can be for personal prejudice to get in the way of principled advocacy. It is time for Senator Hawley's colleagues to remind him that the Republican party is supposed to stand for smaller, not bigger, government.

Josh Hawley (R., Mo.).Since arriving to the Senate in January, Hawley has made a name for himself as a Silicon Valley skeptic. In March, he attracted attention for hisheated cross-examination[1]of Google executives. </p><p>And in May,he delivered[2]a provocative speech at the Hoover Institution in which he called 'the entire social media economy' a 'source of peril' for America.Hawley has also put his legislation where his mouth is. He has floated four separate bills meant to regulate tech:an update[3]to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, afederal Do Not Track right[4],a limit on[5]how video sites serve content containing children, anda ban[6]on 'loot boxes' in video games marketed to kids. This last bill, in particular, has attractedderisive attention[7]from critics, who dismiss it as of a kind with the craze forvideo-game regulation[8]in the 1990s. Video games, social media\u2014is it really fair to bring so much rhetorical and legislative pressure to bear on toys and sites for chatting with your friends? But, as he explained in a wide-ranging conversation with theWashington Free Beacon, Hawley views his legislative work as part of a deeper critique of how tech firms, often heralded as the future of America, have designed a profit model driven more by addiction than innovation. 'One motivation [of the loot box bill] is to protect children from exploitative practices that are targeted directly at them,' Hawley said. 'And I think it gets to a broader question about what video game companies, social media companies, are doing employing exploitative practices, addictive practices, in their business model, often aimed at kids, in order to make money. Is this really something that we want to countenance?' The business models of many tech companies do differ radically from those of traditional firms. When we interact with real-world businesses, we usually trade money for whatever they sell, whether it is a hamburger or repairs to your house. But many popular tech products, like Facebook and YouTube, provide their content to users for free and make their profit off collecting data and then serving personalized ads. Video games increasingly work in much the same way, providing a 'free-to-play' experience that users can really only compete in if they buy in-game content. Hawley's view is that this profit model naturally lends itself to practices that encourage addictive behavior. Thus loot boxes: cheap in-game items that cost money to open, which randomly spit out an item, usually worthless but sometimes rare. The concept, which encourages users to buy many boxes to get a sought-after in-game prize, is reminiscent of casino slot machines. The result, as tech site theVergerecently documented[9], is that players can spend thousands of dollars on games that are nominally 'free.' Hawley is not the only one concerned about this dynamic. His loot box bill is co-sponsored by two Democrats, Sens. Ed Markey (Mass.) and Richard Blumenthal (Conn.). Sen. Maggie Hassan (D., N.H.) told theVergethat she is also interested in more regulation. And overseas, fifteen members of the Gambling Regulators European Forumsigned a letter[10]in September saying they fear the risks of 'blurring of lines between gambling and other forms of digital entertainment such as video gaming.' Most of Hawley's proposals are specifically aimed at restricting tech firms from reaching children. As he put it, he wants to stop firms from 'exploiting children by putting little casinos on their phonesto make a buck,' emphasizing that 'we don't allow casinos to target children and minors.' Kids have been known to spendthousands of dollars[11](orpounds[12]) of their parents' money on in-game purchases. read more[13] [ 1]: <url

Josh Hawley is a man with big ideas who has spent little time thinking about them. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Republican's attempts to legislate and regulate reform in Silicon Valley reek of inexperience and folly. Still, Hawley has managed to bring to light one of the 21\u2019s century\u2019s defining problems: the cultural cost of technological innovation and monetization. </p><p>In yesterday\u2019s Wall Street Journal, Hawley argued, \u201cWhat passes for innovation by Big Tech today isn\u2019t fundamentally new products or new services, but ever more sophisticated exploitation of people.\u201d He has a point. Big Tech\u2019s supposed customers \u2014 or rather their data \u2014 are actually its product. Google, Apple, and the rest use private information to develop precise marketing strategies, and they justify doing so by pointing to the lengthy terms &amp; conditions users must agree to. </p><p>But the lack of clear guidelines has led to an invasion of privacy in many cases. Take, for example, Siri, Apple\u2019s revolutionary voice assistant. A report by The Guardian earlier this year found that Apple contractors can listen to private conversations and overhear confidential information if Siri is accidentally activated. iPhone users have certainly not consented to this kind of intrusion. Alas, try telling that to our tech overlords. </p><p>Hawley also points to the social woes that have accompanied technology\u2019s rise \u2014 higher teen suicide rates, the lack of human relationships, the divergence between online and real life. All of these problems are very real and getting worse. But this is where Hawley gets it wrong: legislation won\u2019t guarantee cultural change. It can, perhaps, inspire it. But real, lasting change must come from the bottom up. </p><p>The freshman from Missouri has introduced multiple bills to ban the \u201cdark patterns\u201d that feed tech addiction and force Big Tech to respect users\u2019 privacy. Unsurprisingly, they\u2019ve gained little traction, because, as many critics have pointed out, such measures would be unproductive at best and unconstitutional at worst. </p><p>But you don\u2019t have to agree with Hawley\u2019s attempted reforms to recognize that a cultural problem does indeed sit in the heart of Silicon Valley. Hawley describes it as \u201cstagnation,\u201d and perhaps he\u2019s right. But Big Tech\u2019s lapse in innovation and judgment have less to do with its attempts to monetize and more to do with its social justice obsession. Take, for example, Google, which has spent the last decade \u2014 and hundreds of millions of dollars \u2014 attempting to \u201ccreate an inclusive culture,\u201d with little to show for it. </p><p>Google has traded in technological innovation for radical social innovation. The company has bought into the politically correct doctrine the cultural Left sells, and as long as it does so, it will be more focused on its role as a cultural actor than as a technological creator. Hence the stagnation. Again, though, this is a problem that no amount of congressional effort can fix. Even if it could, I doubt Big Tech would listen.</p><p>Photo Caption:n this April 4, 2019, file photo, Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee member Josh Hawley, R-Mo., listens to witnesses during the Committee's hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WASHEX-2285035912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WASHEX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X10-VYD1-JBHT-D185-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350189</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"537\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Clarity Media Group, Inc.

The collapse in advertising revenue during the pandemic exacerbated the already perilous financial position of news outlets, who have been decimated by Google and Facebooks monopolistic actions. The Tampa Bay Times was even forced to cut back to two days a week of printed copies. The forgivable loans will allow these newsrooms to obtain some sense of normalcy but wont nearly restore the damage done during this crisis.</p><p>Seattle Times Co. President Alan Fisco noted that at least for now, we are putting on the back burner any plans for broad scale layoffs, or cuts to hours worked. There still may be some targeted reductions, but nothing to the extent of cuts we would have had to make without this support. And while this is an essential step to help news media survive this crisis, thousands of local outlets have been unable to get these specific loans. Despite being deemed an essential service, newsrooms again have been left out of the recent round of federal relief that doesnt provide direct assistance for news outlets.</p><p>Unlike other industry rescue packages, there is real potential that the government could recoup all or most of the support it provides to news outlets. Australian regulators recently forced Google to pay licensing fees to news outlets. U.S. federal and state antitrust regulators are pursuing both Google and Facebook in a major investigation. Google and Facebook have siphoned off tens of billions in ad revenue, from news publishers through their exploitation of the digital advertising market. That revenue used to sustain the journalism industry and part of any antitrust settlement can be used to repay the relief package.</p><p>John Stanton, laid-off former D.C. Bureau Chief at BuzzFeed and co-founder of the Save Journalism Project,</p><p>Access to these loans is helpful to keep these outlets afloat, but a drop in the bucket for an industry that has already been crushed by Google and Facebook, and now the coronavirus. More than 33,000 reporters and staff at news outlets have been forced out of their jobs or subjected to pay cuts during this crisis. What we need is a specific funding pool for news outlets to ensure that the money goes directly to the local outlets that need it, rather than the private equity vultures who are preying on the industry. News publishers have already been bled dry by big tech. What they need now is the government to help them survive this cri- SP sis or else the local news business may be completely wiped out.</p><p>Journalism in America is facing ah existential threat from the monopolistic control of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Apple. Big teens dominance over the digital advertising market and their unrivaled capacity to monetize its platforms are having drastic effects on journalism as a whole.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CPONWS-2440684604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CPONWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60T1-6HG1-JBHT-D37K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">362007</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Call and Post Apr 29-May 5, 2020</copyright><publicationName>Call and Post;

The collapse in advertising revenue during the pandemic exacerbated the already perilous financial position of news outlets, who have been decimated by Google and Facebooks monopolistic actions. The Tampa Bay Times was even forced to cut back to two days a week of printed copies. The forgivable loans will allow these newsrooms to obtain some sense of normalcy but wont nearly restore the damage done during this crisis.</p><p>Seattle Times Co. President Alan Fisco noted that at least for now, we are putting on the back burner any plans for broad scale layoffs, or cuts to hours worked. There still may be some targeted reductions, but nothing to the extent of cuts we would have had to make without this support. And while this is an essential step to help news media survive this crisis, thousands of local outlets have been unable to get these specific loans. Despite being deemed an essential service, newsrooms again have been left out of the recent round of federal relief that doesnt provide direct assistance for news outlets.</p><p>Unlike other industry rescue packages, there is real potential that the government could recoup all or most of the support it provides to news outlets. Australian regulators recently forced Google to pay licensing fees to news outlets. U.S. federal and state antitrust regulators are pursuing both Google and Facebook in a major investigation. Google and Facebook have siphoned off tens of billions in ad revenue, from news publishers through their exploitation of the digital advertising market. That revenue used to sustain the journalism industry and part of any antitrust settlement can be used to repay the relief package.</p><p>John Stanton, laid-off former D.C. Bureau Chief at BuzzFeed and co-founder of the Save Journalism Project,</p><p>Access to these loans is helpful to keep these outlets afloat, but a drop in the bucket for an industry that has already been crushed by Google and Facebook, and now the coronavirus. More than 33,000 reporters and staff at news outlets have been forced out of their jobs or subjected to pay cuts during this crisis. What we need is a specific funding pool for news outlets to ensure that the money goes directly to the local outlets that need it, rather than the private equity vultures who are preying on the industry. News publishers have already been bled dry by big tech. What they need now is the government to help them survive this cri- SP sis or else the local news business may be completely wiped out.</p><p>Journalism in America is facing ah existential threat from the monopolistic control of tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Apple. Big teens dominance over the digital advertising market and their unrivaled capacity to monetize its platforms are having drastic effects on journalism as a whole.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2440684604</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">54880ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V4-6VR1-DYR7-81S0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Call and Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Call &amp;
