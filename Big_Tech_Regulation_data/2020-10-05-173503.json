That pressure followed the latest mass shootings in the US - this time in El Paso, Texas and Dayton, Ohio - and suggestions the suspected perpetrator of the El Paso attack may have been inspired by 8chan and posted on the forum shortly beforehand.  Founded in 2009, Cloudflare is designed to protect websites from the kind of cyber security attacks that could disrupt them enough to knock them - and their content - off the web.  Previously, it has stayed conspicuously neutral on the issue of the kinds of sites it supports, with the exception of white supremicist site Daily Stormer, which it cut off from its services in 2017.  In a statement on Monday, Cloudflare founder and chief Matthew Prince stressed its position is primarily that of network provider.  \"In pursuit of our goal of helping build a better internet, we've considered it important to provide our security services broadly to make sure as many users as possible are secure, and thereby making cyber attacks less attractive - regardless of the content of those websites,\" Prince said.  However, he described 8chan as \"uniquely lawless\".  \"That lawlessness has contributed to multiple horrific tragedies. Enough is enough.\"  From <url normalizedValue=\"https://new.blog.cloudflare.com/terminating-service-for-8chan/\">Prince's full statement</url>, it's clear this was not an easy decision for the founder to make, and not one he was wholly comfortable with.  But, for any tech provider offering services to external parties, whether\u00a0it offers web hosting and protection or Software-as-a-Service, at some point, there is going to be a question of who it's going to do business with, and at what cost. Entrepreneur or content arbiter? Speaking to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">StartupSmart</emphasis>, founder of Aussie VC firm       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/profiles/australia-vc-power-couple-ian-gardiner-amazon-andrea-gardiner-investment-venture-jelix-ventures/\">Jelix Ventures</url> Andrea Gardiner says she is \"completely in agreement\" with Prince's decision, and his lengthy statement about it.  \"It's a pretty tough gig of a founder to play the role of a content arbiter,\" she says.  \"There's no political legitimacy for them to make those determinations of what is acceptable or not, and where to draw the line,\" she notes.  \"On the other hand ... when it comes to the point that it's really fuelling hate and potentially hate-motivated violence, then there's a moral imperative not to support it,\" she adds.  \"I just don't think founders, and these companies, can turn a blind eye to it.\"  Prince's statement also stresses that Cloudflare is not a political or legal body.  \"Questions around content are real societal issues that need politically legitimate solutions,\" Prince says.  And Gardiner is of the same opinion, saying there has to be a political agenda around what can and cannot be published online.  While big tech companies like Facebook do put a lot of resources into moderating content, she says, it doesn't have a legal remit.  \"I don't think it should be Facebook's responsibility to draw the line. It actually should be enshrined in law,\" Gardiner says.  European legislators are already working on laws that begin to tackle this, and that have different considerations for businesses that actually publish content, such as Facebook and YouTube, and those that merely facilitate third-party sites, such as Cloudflare.  \"In principle, I'm not a big one for over-regulation, but I think there does need to be some sort of regulatory obligations,\" Gardiner says.  Such rules should only pertain to very extreme views, she stresses. And - importantly - they should be defined with significant consultation with the tech industry.  \"The politicians would make a hash of it if they tried to do it without that. It wouldn't be workable. They would end up destroying the tech businesses,\" she says.  Indeed, after the terrorist attack in Christchurch earlier this year,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/op-ed/government-abandoned-australian-startups/\">new laws were rushed through</url> the Senate, penalising tech companies that host \"abhorrent violent material\", without any real consultation with the industry.  Having the government manage legislation to do with moderating content online \"would be potentially completely disastrous unless technology companies are the ones helping to propose and develop the solutions\", Gardiner says.  \"They're the only ones that actually understand what is doable and what is not.\" Find your moral code But, in the absence of any legal framework, M8 Ventures partner Alan Jones calls on startups to place more importance on their own moral code.  Private companies are often expected to be amoral, he says.  \"Individuals should be held to shared moral code and even that our political representatives should adhere to moral code, but for some reason, private companies get a free pass from acting morally,\" he notes.  Society seems to allow businesses to run entirely in pursuit of profit, he adds. That's not a luxury that's afforded to anyone else.  While Jones agrees Cloudflare's severing of services to 8chan was indeed the right thing to do, what is interesting is that Price felt so uncomfortable doing it.  \"We continue to feel incredibly uncomfortable about playing the role of content arbiter and do not plan to exercise it often,\" Price said in the statement.  However, Jones says this was not an editorial decision. It was a moral one.  \"I would encourage every startup founder and startup employee to explore the dimensions of their shared moral compass as a company,\" he says.  \"A moral framework is just as important for a private company as it is for an individual or a government.\"  Jones says this is not just an issue for the Cloudflares of the world, or even the Facebooks and YouTubes. It's something founders should consider from day one.  \"The sooner you begin to involve a moral framework in the development of your business, the easier it is.\"  This is one of many things in early-stage startups that \"seems very important, but not urgent\", Jones explains.  When founders have so many other things to do and such few resources, that can make them \"very, very difficult to address\", he adds.  \"But it doesn't get easier. It gets harder the longer you leave it.\" You don't get a free pass Jones notes two examples of Australian startup giants that have implemented their moral codes particularly well: Atlassian and Canva.  Canva's terms and conditions, for example, have a clause saying the startup \"does not support and will not tolerate its service being used to discriminate against others, especially when based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, disability, ancestry or national origin\".  Users are not permitted to use Canva to incite or support discrimination, or to incite violence. And if it suspects they are, it will suspend offending accounts \"without notice and liability\".  As a private company, Jones notes, it's Canva's prerogative to disallow conduct that doesn't fit with its own values. And all startups have the power to be just as brutal. Clearly, this approach       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/news/canva-100-million-funding-round/\">hasn't been at the expense of success</url>.  But, that's not to say startups should take any particular position on anything, Jones says. They should just know where they stand themselves.  \"If you want to be a gay-hating gun-toting startup, go for it,\" he adds.  \"I'm not saying all of Australia's tech startups have to have the same moral stance as me. That's not the point at all.\"  However, public companies are starting to have more and more responsibility for the services we use on a daily basis.  \"So, I don't think we can afford to continue to give them a free pass from moral obligation,\" he says.  \"We all want to go home with some money in our pocket, to make all the sacrifices worthwhile. But most of us in the startup industry genuinely do want to try to make the world a little bit better.\"  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/analysis/being-neutral-hurts-profitability-engagement/\">NOW READ:\u00a0Take a stand: Why being neutral hurts profitability and engagement</url></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/startupsmart/analysis/coal-startups-economic-slack/\">NOW READ:\u00a0The world is leaving coal behind, and it's up to startups to pick up the economic slack</url></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMARTC-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMARTC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS1-1PY1-JD6R-T4RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388473</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1347\"/><timeReceived>2:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SmartCompany</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50625\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 7, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Labor &amp;

But to hear Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince tell it, a renewed push into China by Silicon Valley s big tech firms isn t far off.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I don t know of a lot of companies that are investing in this area,  says Prince.  But I think over time it s inevitable. </p><p>Cloudflare s looking to make its move first. The San Francisco-based company announced on Tuesday that it plans to operate and support 150 data centers across China through a new partnership with Chinese internet companies JD Cloud and Al, a subsidiary of Chinese e-commerce giant JD.com. The agreement, which requires the Chinese partners to build and maintain the data centers across the country over the next three years, while using Cloudflare s software to operate and support operations, will split revenue between the partners.\u00a0</p><p>Cloudflare and its China-based partners declined to disclose the value of the deal. But the move will almost double Cloudflare s existing global footprint of 200 data centers in as many cities, the company says   a significant increase in footprint for the company that went public in September 2019.</p><p>By deepening its presence in China, Cloudflare is betting that it can take a big slice of the global content delivery industry in the world s second largest market as adoption of cloud software soars. With Cloudflare s software, U.S. businesses looking to enter the Chinese market will be able to connect faster with customers in regions typically unavailable.  They are mavericks, none of their peers are doing it,  says Ted Chamberlain, a cloud software analyst at Gartner.  They are making a bet that this will be an absolute home run. \u00a0</p><p>Launched in 2010, Cloudflare provides a suite of products that allow businesses to improve access to their websites with tools such as firewalls, routing, virtual private networks (VPNs) and traffic optimization. Soon after launching, co-founder and CEO Matt Prince says he noticed many Cloudflare customers were based in China; in 2015, the company partnered with Chinese internet provider Baidu to provide its software at 17 data centers in cities across the country.\u00a0 If we were going to help build a better internet, that inherently meant we were going to have to build a bigger presence in China,  says Prince.</p><p>The company has grown in a sector of the cloud industry known as content delivery networks, which provide the plumbing of the internet by powering how you access a company s website, including monitoring its incoming traffic to spot and block attacks. In that market, Cloudflare competes with other firms including Fastly, Akamai and Amazon s AWS Cloudfront product. The company raised $330 million from investors   including New Enterprise Associates, Fidelity and Franklin Templeton Investment   before its September IPO; today, its shares trade at a market capitalization of about $7.4 billion.\u00a0</p><p>Cloudflare s double-down on China has struck some observers as bold given current political tensions between the two nations. In the past year, U.S. policy makers including Senator Marco Rubio<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>have lashed out</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>at U.S. companies doing business in China.Major Chinese technology firms have also      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>been blacklisted</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>amid national security concerns. And the Trump administration has      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>reportedly</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>mulled further restrictions on Chinese telecom and 5G network builder Huawei to ban its access to U.S. chipmakers.\u00a0</p><p>Even in friendlier times, China has proven a notoriously hard place for U.S. tech companies to make money. One big reason: a requirement that U.S. companies must partner with local providers in China while remaining subject to tight local regulations. Amazon, Facebook and Google have all been shut out of the local market or faced major complications in China; Uber more recently entered the market and<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>retreated</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>. Cloudflare is entering a crowded market dominated by local incumbents, including Alibaba and Tencent.  You really can t point to a dominant global cloud business that s having success in China,  says Byron Deeter, a cloud-focused investor at venture capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners. (Amazon s cloud unit does have a presence in the country.)</p><p>At Cloudflare, Prince acknowledges all those complications and the current COVID-19 health crisis. But he insists that Cloudflare s platform is sheltered from security issues and breaches because it provides an open source product, and therefore is not deemed a trade secret or protected by intellectual property like the software provided by Google, Facebook or Microsoft. He claims Cloudflare s agreement with JD.com is not subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny, meanwhile, because the Chinese firm will not take ownership of any Cloudflare shares.\u00a0</p><p> Undoubtedly there will be some people that might scratch their head,  says Prince.  But understanding our business and where the value in our business is, I don t think we have the same concerns that some firms have with keeping their intellectual property a trade secret.  (A spokesperson for JD Cloud and Al said the company  maintains the highest level of compliance and security standards for companies operating cloud services in China. )</p><p>And while Cloudflare s move is unusual, it is not alone. In 2018, Google<link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>invested $550 million</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>in JD.com to expand its retail operations footprint in the region. More recently, Salesforce, the $141 billion customer relationship management software leader,      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>partnered</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>with Alibaba in July 2019 to sell its products in China. Last August, Intel doubled down on an      \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>agreement</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>with Baidu to offer its suite of products, including cloud software and artificial intelligence, to Chinese customers. And separately, JD.com itself maintains partnerships with several U.S. retailers who sell products on its site, including Apple, Dell, HP, P&amp;G, Walmart and Sam s Club.</p><p>To Prince, such a partnership actually comes at an opportune moment. Better to get underway now, he says, before American firms rush to do more business with Chinese customers when coronavirus-related restrictions are eased. Cloudflare has at least one U.S.-based customer using it in China already: GPS technology firm Garmin, he says.</p><p>The internet, after all, is global, Cloudflare s CEO maintains   even in a pandemic.  At the end of a day we are a tech company,  says Prince.  We are trying to figure out how to build great internet service everywhere on Earth. \u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FRBCOM-5ea856b8718794000643d8da</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FRBCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YSN-73P1-JBCM-F1XM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">442244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1090\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Forbes LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Forbes.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The basic premise of Start Me Up is that all around the countryside are thousands of old dead cars, with interesting back stories and the potential to make them live again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So myself and a pretty handy engineer called Martin have a day to diagnose the cause of death, hopefully craft up some kind of a cure and tell the life story of the car. A reviewer called the show Antiques Roadshow meets Top Gear and Mucking In.</p><p>I'm not sure about that, but it's proved a lot of fun and we've met some great folks. We get given each car around 9am and need to have it driveable by sundown. While it was a bit wonky in the early episodes, we learn something from each car we work on and get to use that knowledge on the future ones.</p><p>READ MORE: * US to investigate Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon * Mike O'Donnell: Staying ahead of the pack on digital technology * Mike O'Donnell: Social media: an endurance event, not a sprint</p><p>Writing now at the end of 2019, it strikes me the same thing is true of business. The lessons from the past year give clues about the future. Particularly with my area of interest which is where business, the internet and consumers cross over.</p><p>Looking back on 2019, a few things stand out.</p><p>First, the situation of Facebook, the world's biggest content publisher (which creates no original content itself) has gone from bad to worse. Following hard on the heels of the 2018 Cambridge Analytica trainwreck, 2019 saw congressional inquiries, electoral disgraces and an imploding cryptocurrency project.</p><p>Second, China's dominance around data, artificial intelligence and online ecosystems just gets stronger. Behind the great firewall of China, in an environment where state control and partial ownership dominates virtually all the big web services; innovation and embedding have taken off.</p><p>Further afield China is hoovering up AI patents and intellectual property like crazy. Web Guru Mary Meeker estimates Chinese entities were across 40 per cent of all AI transactions in the US this year. If that's even half right, it's clear that things are going to change for the historically English speaking internet.</p><p>Third, AI is aflame with growth and it's become part of our daily lives.</p><p>From medicine, to financial services to entertainment; AI and more specifically the subset of machine learning known as deep learning is with us each day. From the way your child's Hello Barbie doll works, through to the way your credit company catches fraud through to the way Snopes identifies fake content on your search results.</p><p>Lastly, at a time that newspaper circulation reached its lowest point in 80 years according to Pew Research, it was confirmed three months ago that the percentage of digital advertising being hoovered up by the digital giants is heading north again.</p><p>In August eMarketer released research showing more than two-thirds of all digital ad spending (68.1 per cent) goes to Google, Facebook and Amazon. No wonder virtually every private sector media company is for sale.</p><p>So looking forward, what can we expect 2020 to bring us?</p><p>The first thing is greater regulation coming across the web giants, at least those in the Western world. This was foreshadowed a couple of months ago when the United States Justice Department opened an antitrust review of the largest tech companies. Meanwhile, across the Atlantic, fresh from throwing a US$1.6 billion fine on Google, the European Commission is opening a new investigation into Google and Facebook's use of data.</p><p>Closer to home, after the successful implementation of the Amazon tax in Aotearoa, the Government is looking at how to progress a digital services tax like the one planned for the UK.</p><p>Not all the regulatory proposals will get traction in 2020, but some will and the process will prove a massive area of focus and pain for big tech companies.</p><p>Next, AI is going to move from something bespoke you build inhouse, to something configurable that you pipe in.</p><p>While it's been around for a couple of years, AI as a service (AIaaS) is set to take off. AIaaS is third-party provision of artificial intelligence. This means companies get to take advantage of AI without spending a boatload of money or taking on substantial risk.</p><p>AIaaS is configurable (you have a bunch of controls you can play with to build out a product) rather than customisable (where you have data boffins and programmers doing bespoke development). Going forward this will evolve rapidly into data visualisation, facial recognition, language processing and API building.</p><p>Lastly in 2020, 5G data networks will move from being a buzzword to a reality. While here in New Zealand Vodafone had an initial foray into 5G in a few neighbourhoods across the three main cities, it's a toe in the ocean stuff.</p><p>The thing about 5G is that it's not only up to 100x faster than 4G, it will kill the viability of many wire-based services. The huge bandwidth also opens up the potential of machines, robots and autonomous vehicles and likely result in a doubling down of the Internet of Things.</p><p>The thing about cold starting old cars is that you know that the same basic rules around fuel/spark/compression that have been around for the past 100 years will get you through.</p><p>Too bad there aren't the equivalent rules for business in the 2020s.</p><p>- Mike \"MOD\" O'Donnell is a professional director and a part-time broadcaster.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STUFNZ-STF1912210074118319671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STUFNZ2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSS-3DH1-DYTR-J02C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">466477</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"900\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 \u00a9 Stuff Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>STUFF.CO.NZ</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 21, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Then he slapped Amazon with an investigation into its plan to take a small stake in Deliveroo.</p><p>Now, the former select committee hard man has gone looking for a fight with Google in the US with a review into its $2.6bn (\u00a32bn) takeover of cloud computing services provider Looker.</p><p>This looks like Tyrie is drawing a line in the sand, saying that he won't allow the Silicon Valley giants to hoover up any smaller competitors while a full-blown investigation into the structure of digital markets is in the works.</p><p>Facebook and Google control roughly two thirds of Britain's \u00a313bn digital advertising market. The CMA is rightly concerned that the pair can abuse their dominance of customer data to shut-out competition and overcharge advertisers, who then pass the costs onto consumers.</p><p>There is a broader worry too that the cash gusher from the duopoly is used to expand and strengthen their dominance over the entire digital economy by snapping up anything that could challenge Google and Facebook. It's telling that the only company that appears to have any hope of breaking the duopoly is Amazon, an online giant bigger and uglier than either of them.</p><p>Facebook's purchase of Instagram for instance maintained its grip on young people online even as its core product became mostly a forum for grandparents to share family snaps and their views on Brexit.

The watchdog must currently go through the courts in order to impose any punishments or penalties.Advertisement - Article continues belowEven towards the end of last year, the CMA began to flex its own muscles[2] with regards to taking action against tech companies, in preparations for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.After the European Commission proposed looking into Google's data collection practices[3] in December 2019, for example, the CMA announced it would specifically review the company's acquisition of big data analytics firm Looker in a separate probe.The European Commission previously held jurisdiction over all EU territories, including the UK, over matters concerning competition, mergers, and antitrust, among others.In light of the UK's EU withdrawal on 31 January, the CMA has, by default, been handed a much larger set of responsibilities than it held previously.The swelling scale of digital companies, moreover, has turned officials' attentions towards the likes of Google and Facebook in recent years, led by the European Commissioner for Competition, Margrethe Vestager.Coscelli's comments point towards the CMA taking up the work carried out by Vestager, should the government grant the authority the stronger powers it demands. </p><p>Last year, for example, the European Commission issued a \u20ac1.49 billion fine against Google[4] for restrictions in its AdSense platform. These may be the sort of investigations the CMA may seek to replicate post-Brexit.

This follows the release of the CMA's report on digital advertising and online platforms the same day.Among the suggested initiatives is unprecedented cross-collaboration across different U.K. regulatory bodies\u2014the CMA, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) and Ofcom\u2014to help establish a new regulatory regime. The proposal reflects the CMA's belief that its current competition law toolkit is not adequate to tackle big-tech issues.It will be interesting to see how the Government reacts, given the politics of Brexit and the desired U.S. trade deal. Regardless, the CMA is showing no signs of easing back from its interventionist enforcement agenda. </p><p>Report Finds That Google and Facebook Have Entrenched Positions of Market Power The CMA has spent more than a year researching online platforms and digital advertising, and its findings build on the previously published Furman and Stigler reviews. The 450-page final report[1] concludes that: Google and Facebook are dominant in their relevant digital advertising markets. Google has more than a 90% share of the 7.3 billion search advertising market in the U.K., while Facebook holds over 50% of the 5.5 billion display advertising market. High market shares in these markets are protected by strong incumbency advantages\u2014network effects, economies of scale and unmatchable access to user data\u2014that stifle competition. The CMA's current powers are insufficient to address this dominance, since the competition concerns in these markets are so wide-ranging and self-reinforcing.The CMA therefore recommends establishing a pro-competition ex ante regulatory regime for online platforms, and a Digital Markets Unit to enforce that regime. The regime itself would comprise two broad categories of intervention: An enforceable code of conduct, which will ensure that platforms like Google and Facebook do not engage in exploitative or exclusionary practices; and A range of pro-competition interventions. These include behavioural measures such as ordering Facebook to increase its inter-operability with competing social media platforms, whilst also leaving scope for more drastic 'separation measures' such as divestments and operational ring-fencing.The CMA report also advocates a competitive-neutral approach to implementing privacy regulation, in order to make sure that big platforms are not able to exploit privacy regulation to their advantage. Cross Regulatory Supervision Mooted as the Solution The CMA's press release[2] sets out a framework of how to address the conclusions of the report, focussing in particular on unprecedented collaboration between U.K. regulators: Establishing a Digital Markets Taskforce\u2014a cross-collaboration with ICO and Ofcom\u2014to build on the conclusions of the market study. The Taskforce will advise the government on how a new regulatory regime for digital markets should be designed, with formal advice due at the end of this year. The CMA will publish a call for information and reach out to a number of market participants to inform the Taskforce's work. Establishing a Digital Regulation Cooperation Forum\u2014again, a cross-collaboration with ICO and Ofcom\u2014to facilitate open dialogue and collaboration between the three regulators on a variety of areas, including future policy-making.The press release does confirm, however, that no CMA competition law market investigation reference is being made. Instead, the CMA notes that: 'after the work of the Taskforce has concluded, it will assess whether the actions being taken by the government are sufficient to address the full range of issues identified by its market study, or whether direct action by the CMA is likely to be required.' A market investigation would represent the logical next step towards direct CMA remedial action against Facebook and Google using the CMA's current competition law powers. Following the Money The CMA is one in a long line of competition regulators to try to put structure in the techlash debate. The European Commission issued its report into Digital Markets in 2019 and launched a consultation in June 2020 on a new competition tool to include under its Digital Services Act[3], including the power to subject sectors to investigation and order changes without finding an infringement or ordering a fine; we've also had the U.S. Stigler report[4] (2019) and the Dutch ACM's Digitalisation Strategy[5] (2019), among others.These previous studies have posed general questions about how to assess the markets and what tools should be used in this new world: How to quantify market power in two-sided markets? Is there a market for data? How do you measure consumer harm if a service is free?The CMA has in this report, however opted to follow the money\u2014advertising. Advertising is the monetisation of a two-sided digital market. Data is an input for advertising. Advertising is how customers pay for 'free' services. It is therefore a pragmatic and sensible place to start getting to grips with whether or not 'digital' markets need regulatory intervention and how.The report is being welcomed as one of the first to be released on this basis, but it is unlikely to be the last; France, Germany and Sweden are proceeding with similar studies (as mentioned in the CMA's report), and the Australian ACCC launched its own investigation into the digital advertising technology supply chain and advertising agency services in March 2020. It has also sparked calls within other jurisdictions for similar measures to regulate digital advertising (see, e.g., the U.S.[6]).Addressing the issues in a holistic way involving different regulators is also an expedient and efficient way to proceed. In the EU, criticisms were aimed at an institutional design which drew the regulatory arm of the Commission and its competition enforcement arm under the same person. Formalising links and cooperative efforts between regulatory departments, if it works, retains the necessary synergies and ability to innovative from such collaboration whilst avoiding some of the concerns related to the concentration of power and politicisation of competition enforcement. Commentators have already noted that the CMA's work plan will formalise the previously ambiguous level of cooperation between the relevant agencies. The CMA Showing Its Ambition to Be a Leading Enforcer Post-Brexit The report and announced work plan are further evidence of the CMA's increasing interventionism and desire to be seen as a leading international regulator, particularly post-Brexit. The press release acknowledges this expansionist ambition: 'Whilst this recommendation is U.K.-focused, many of the problems that the CMA has identified are international in nature. It will therefore continue to take a leading role globally in relation to these issues as part of the CMA's wider digital strategy.' The CMA notes that its own Digital Markets Taskforce will 'pay close attention' to regulatory proposals being developed in other jurisdictionsThe report and press release are also evidence of the CMA's growing interventionist stance towards Big Tech. The regulator had already intervened in Amazon/Deliveroo in July 2019, citing concerns that Amazon's investment could damage competition, potentially by discouraging Amazon from either independently re-entering the U.K. market for online restaurant-food delivery or from developing its presence in the market for online delivery of convenience groceries.[1]The report and announcement coincide with CMA Chairman Andrew Tyrie's premature retirement. In a letter to the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy[7] dated 25 February 2019, Tyrie asked for several extended powers for the CMA, including mandatory notification of cross-border deals and a 'standstill' obligation which would stop deal completion while an investigation is taking place. Several sources cite Tyrie's frustration at being unable to deliver these changes as the reason behind his departure, with Tyrie noting 'inherent limits' in what he could achieve for the CMA from within the organisation.Tyrie advocated for increased powers on the basis that markets were not working effectively for the consumer. The fact that Tyrie has met resistance not only shows uncertainty as to what kind of power the U.K. wants the CMA to have post-Brexit but also possible unsureness as to how the CMA will fit within the U.K.'s geopolitical strategy post-Brexit. For example, adopting Tyrie's stance would inevitably lead to having to deal with the likes of Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple; this isn't necessarily aligned with the free-market attitude that would facilitate a trade deal with the U.S.So whilst the report and press release are bold steps in the 'fair markets' direction advocated by Tyrie, it will be interesting to see what and how quick the CMA's next steps are, particularly in the absence of Tyrie himself.

It certainly has been for us so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the topic of managing regulatory risk, when we look about how regulators are reacting in this current economic cycle, probably the biggest question I have is, are you seeing the regulators recognizing the cost of capital is a lot higher, has been a lot higher, and have you found the regulators to be accommodating of that environment? Can each of you discuss what the regulator perspective has been and how your relationship with regulators has changed in the current environment? And Jim, if we could start with you.</p><p>JAMES JUDGE, CFO, SVP, TREASURER, NSTAR: Sure, at NSTARwe're in a somewhat unique position because we entered into a seven-year rate dale in late 2005, and part of that rate deal was an allowed (inaudible) that was considered up to 12.5% before we share with customers. So we really aren't in a rate case mode where cost of capital is being discussed. I know there's a number of utilities, I think a record number of rate cases filed in the third quarter of last year, 21 rate cases I think in the industry.</p><p>So I'm sure there's a lot of discussion and controversy over what the appropriate allowed hours (inaudible) are these days, and especially in light of the interest rate environment. But from my perspective, I've seen about a 10.25, 10.5 allowed hour [week] even though the utilities have been (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, Mark?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE, </nameText></person>CFO, EVP, WESTAR ENERGY: Well, we just settled a rate case in November and it settled with a higher ROE than we had at, for accounting purposes it was pegged at 10.4 even though it wasn't particularly specified, which at the time of our negotiations looked pretty good for us. It was a little bit of an increase. Obviously since then with the market fall off, we believed cost of capital is significantly higher than that. Our regulators seem to appreciate that if not for our benefit having just settled a case, another utility in the state was in the middle of a case, and in fact the staff recommendation came out higher than what was in the utility's application.</p><p>So there is a growing appreciation for the importance of understanding that you can't take care of customers unless you also take care of the investors, and both of those parties have to be treated fairly.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Jim?</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI, CFO, EVP, TREASURER, EDISON INTERNATIONAL: In California, we have a cost of capital mechanism that's currently set at 11.5% term common equity and we have a unique arrangement for 2010 that the cost of capital will only change based on the movement of the Moody's Baa index. And it's tracking right now that the cost of capital could increase based on an annual move of that index. So we'll have to wait and see what happens. I think generally regulators recognize that things are different. We just got our rate case approved in the first quarter of this year. A lot of consternation about that. I think generally the regulators were concerned that they wanted us to spend money because they look at it as a stimulus program, and they do recognize that maintaining high and efficient cost of capitals are important in terms of having healthy utilities.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: And on that very specific relation that you have with the Moody's Bond Yield, so my understanding is that there's a question of whether it's a A or a Moody's Baa level, and you guys have filed for a Baa level of yields. Can you talk through any indications you may have had from the CPUC as to whether they're going to look at one version or another? How are they responding to your proposal to look at it from a Baa perspective?</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: Well, I think in our case it's very clear it's the Baa index. They've approved that mechanism, so we have clarity around what might happen there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, great. Robert?</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND, CFO, SVP, CONSOLIDATED EDISON: So, I'm going to pick up both of the moving parts of the capitalization for Consolidated Edison. On the fixed income side, rates have come up for us. I suspect they have for most, although the last couple months they've been coming back down. The commission did something a little out of the ordinary for us in this last round, but we are trued up on interest rates, both taxable and tax-exempt. So no exposure on interest rates, which I suppose you could read either way, but at least we're covered.</p><p>On the equity side, we're in a serious of rate cases and all of our services. So when Jim said 23 cases, my guess is we've got a handful of those. So the commission is getting a pretty regular look at cost of capital. Their methodology is pretty prescriptive and I think they would argue is highly reflective of the marginal cost of capital for utilities, discounted cash flow, or what I would call a dividend discount model and a capital asset pricing model. May or may not be happy with the particular inputs that they chose, but methodologically speaking for the marginal cost of capital is pretty transparent to what's going on in the markets.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, actually on that question, Robert, in the last rate decision that was handed down, you and I spoke a little bit earlier about some of the austerity measures that were handed down. I know that that's separate from the cost of capital question. But was it your sense at all that the commission's view towards those, what I believe you position as arbitrary reductions, was that related to the fact that the cost of capital was extremely high, in your opinion? Any sense on that?</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: No, I don't think so. If you look at the trend in regulatory decisions in New York, the last couple of years the rates have been between, I don't know, 9.7 and 9.1, 2006, '07, and '08, and this year in the decisions that have come before the commissioner that they've approved, the returns have been between 10 to 10.3, 10.4. So the dollars at stake in that range, 115, 120 basis points average I think is relatively small. That's not a significant customer impact. I think the O&amp;M reductions were really more a straw in the wind read on the part of the commission on the economic environment, and more specifically the political implications of the economic environment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I see, and John, your thoughts on the regulatory environment cost of capital?</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL, PRESIDENT AND CEO, CONSUMERS ENERGY: In Michigan, we have two pending rate cases both in electric and gas. I think the Michigan Public Service Commission understands the correlation between the cost of capital and the return on equity that we need to move forward. I think Michigan is particularly disadvantaged in the way the economy is going in Michigan is going today. So I think they're more aware of it and heightened towards that need. Cases of looking at 10.7%, 11% return on equity, which right now for regular, routine cases, as far as we're concerned that seems reasonable.</p><p>So I think they do understand it and part of it comes with education too, whether it's formulistic or whether it comes with understanding the markets, I think that's the responsibility we have to help the commission understand how these work.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Right, well on a secondary subject along that train of thought, are you seeing that regulators are much more willing to be constructive with you in order to maintain and investment grade credit rating? It would seem to us that in this type of environment, they want to make sure, they should want to make sure that your investment grade credit rating isn't in any way threatened by what's going on in the credit markets. Can you talk about that thought pattern? What are you seeing with the regulators? Are you seeing them be more constructive with you or potentially more dilutive to you? And where do you think things are going to go from here? Jim?</p><p>JAMES JUDGE: Yes, as I say, we're not really in the rate environment because we have a -- we still have, in the middle I guess of a seven-year rate (inaudible), but I can say that we have an eight plus credit. You go to EEI's website and the list of 58 utilities, we have the strongest credit rating in the industry. And what better testament than last year in terms of the importance of that. The capital markets were in turmoil. We were issuing commercial paper uninterrupted.</p><p>We issued $100 million earlier this year (inaudible) money that had a four in front of it. It was under 5% and I think if you had a DDD plus credit or worse, you're looking at 200 or 300 basis points beyond that. So that's millions of dollars more that rate case would pay over time in terms of cost of service because the credit rating had been weaker. So I feel great about the fact that obviously we have a strong credit quality right now, but even more likely that (inaudible) the regulators in Massachusetts, it's credible to maintain going forward.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mark?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: There seems to be a keen understanding, probably even a closer understanding than in the cost of equity with regard to the importance of maintaining credit ratings in Kansas. We're not in the traditional general rate case mode right now, but I think it's fair to say the staff and the commission have an appreciation for the importance of credit ratings. Having said that, the commission and the commission staff has not been particularly prescriptive on those issues in terms of the amount of equity in the capital structure, so long as it's within a reasonable zone. I think Kansas regulators, if there's an appropriate trust between the management and the regulators, they allow management to manage the company and its capital structure as it sees fit.</p><p>If we were to do something outside of the normal range, we have no doubt that they would exercise their authority and demonstrate their opinions more forcefully. But we haven't put them in that situation, I think they trust that we'll manage our company responsibly with an eye toward keeping the cost of capital low as a portion of the cost of service.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I see. I see. Actually, Jim, on this question about investment grade credit ratings, I was talking with one of your peers elsewhere in the industry, and the comment that they were making was, when you run an integrated utility and you are pursuing any type of strategic options with the merchant generation fleet, your flexibility to pursue options is constrained by the fact that you have to also watch what the credit rating agencies say and do about your rating.</p><p>And the argument was that it actually makes more inherent business sense to separate merchant agendas as for purely regulated business, because otherwise you just got to bed through too many hoops. What would you say to that view? Does it make sense, or do you actually think that the considerations you have to give to a credit rating agency aren't that onerous that an integrated utility business model actually can work out just fine?</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: Well, I think we all have stories about dealing with the credit rating agencies and how much credit you give to them in terms of their theories. And I struggle at times with some of the mechanisms that a few of the rating agencies have and their logic for how they determine particular notching from the holding company, to the operating companies, to the merchant generation. Those are fairly difficult standards you have to work with, and you can go into arguments about that equivalence and the impact it might have on your balance sheet.</p><p>But I think it's important overall from a rate making perspective that there's no perceived preference or support given to the non-utility side. And if there's an action that if your merchant generation falls, if the credit rating of a merchant generator falls and somehow effects the holding company, than indirectly pulls down the utility, I think that would be perceived to be bad. A familiar question is how you fit all these pieces together.</p><p>I think we've been able to maneuver over time that we've got the best of both worlds because we've seen both sides of the business being up and down, and it wasn't too long ago when we had to ring fence our merchant generation company from our utility because our utility was declining in credit quality precipitously during the California energy crisis. Now, we're probably flipped all the way around now. We're -- EME is struggling and FC is having a good run.</p><p>So having both sides of the business we think is the right way to go. You have to watch the credit rating issues because I don't want to have any kind of perception that the utility is in any way supporting the non-utility side.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: When I was having a discussion with Ted Kramer not too long ago --</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: Oh, is that the guy you were talking to?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Maybe. One of the points that he brought up was that it was adamant they get across to the credit rating agencies and the regulators that there would be no external, or there would be no extra support given to EME from the parent and the regulated utility, SoCalEd. Have you found the credit rating agencies and the regulators asking you or more concerned about that question? Or do you feel that -- or have you not seen that crop up as an issue?</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: No, we go through those conversations with really the rating agencies. We have very clear and deliberate affiliate roles in the state. You must follow those or you don't even go up to the line on those. So that's clear. There's not much discussion with your regulators on those. So with the rating agencies, we spent a lot of times trying to tell them about the protections the utility has in the state vis-a-vis how dollars can move up to the holding company and how dollars may flow down the non-utility side. And you get into a very extensive debates about the rigor of those protections and what might happen should the non-utility side get in distress.</p><p>Those are your really hot debate points, and I think to a certain degree one of the rating agencies is very locked into their structure, how they like to see separations, and how much they're willing to see between the operating companies and the holding company. And those are ongoing debates right now. A couple of rating agencies are looking at the credit rating of Edison Mission Energy as a result of cash flows being substantially reduced because the power prices are down.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Last question on this.</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: I get another one?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: One more with you, Jim. I've seen a lot of investors comment that the implied value of Mission in Edison's share price can be in the negative side right now, depending on how you value SoCalEd. And I dare say that that's actually the investor consensus right now. What sort of steps do you think can be taken over the next 12 months to help show that that may not be the right way to look at the shares, or that there is some hidden value there beyond waiting for economic recovery or gas prices to rise, something outside of your control.</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: I think I've had this question a few times, even today. I think it's illogical that EME could trade for a negative value. It just doesn't make much sense. When you look at the components of Edison International, there's the big utility and there's non-utility side, and you've got a good comp in terms of PG&amp;E in terms of how it trades, and how SCE should trade. So you can value SCE fairly easily, and to the extent, after you adjust for some minimum amount of holding company dreg, you can figure out what the value of EME, EIX should be.</p><p>So we go through the process of talking with people, and I challenge people try to arb out that difference, because it seems like it's money on the table. And a lot of people understand that belief, and getting value out of EME is really an option on the commodity cycle. If we get the commodity cycle, if you get to the recovery point, I think EME ultimately will have value. It's got some environmental challenges and we're working through those issues too, but it's an ongoing process reminding folks what the facts are and I think ultimately you'll see some value there.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay, great.</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: Going to ask some other questions?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think we're good. Robert and John, one of the things that we have been curious about is, do you see that in this higher cost of capital environment the regulators are a little bit less willing to allow past through for big ticket items? Are you finding yourself having to be a little bit more judicious in terms of what you ask for in terms of investment?</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL: I don't think they're resistant to big ticket items, as long as a big ticket items are communicated with them, that there's a value that the customers receive from that, and it's something of interest to that. And so, the big difference is if we're going to build a power plant or we're going to move forward with renewable energy, it's something that they want to have happen. If they're opposed to a new coal plant or opposed to renewable energy optimization, then yes, we're going to meet resistance based on that.</p><p>But it helps and we've done it in Michigan where you've changed -- you've adopted energy legislation that enables us to move forward on a certainty basis. So we know what we're investing in, the cost of investments so we can move it forward. So if the commission was opposed to something, I'd think, yes, they're going to tell you that and make it very difficult, particularly for the big tech guys.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Is there any big disagreement between you and the commission between what you think needs to be done over the long run and what -- ?</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL: What is what in the long -- ?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Is there a big difference in opinion between what you think needs to be done over the long run versus what they think needs to be done in the long run?</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL: No, I don't think so. I mean, I think part of it is the way to get to the end we may debate, is it best to go, think of a balanced portfolio, is it best to do it with nuclear, with new clean coal or renewables. I think at that point you need to align and say we can get there by this standard. The thing that we need both from the regulators and what was incorporated into the law in Michigan is certainty, and it's clear to have that certainty, many of us on the electric side of the business are concerned about the uncertainty of the rules that are going on with a mission controls today.</p><p>I'd rather have certainty, reasonable certainty so we can move forward and build, and that's what we've done in Michigan with the law, a standard for renewable energy, a standard for energy optimization, a process that if you build a big ticket item you can go through a certificate of necessity process to ensure that that has been fully vetted and approved for the future. And with the type of big ticket items we're talking about, I think other are here, you want to ensure you have that certainty so you can make the investment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: How about in New York?</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: A little harder to answer the question for New York because we don't really have a big ticket item. The utilities in the state are effectively out of the production business. We have a steam business, the biggest steam business in the world, but it's still, it's like 1.4 billion of rate base. So it's not that big. But I'd second what John said, which I think is, as long as the regulator is in agreement with the purpose of the spend, the purpose of the spend is not the issue.</p><p>The Public Service Commission when they approved rates for us in April approved more than half a billion dollar increase that comes on top of a $425 million increase the year before. There aren't really big projects in that increase, but the amount of dollars that they're approving, and that was, I think we got $5.25 million this time plus $200 million in a tax recovery.</p><p>So almost three-quarters of a $1 billion in increase to the end use customer, and they were willing to sign off on that. So that's a pretty big bite. But it's because they like the discrete pieces that they see in that proposal or they don't actively dislike them. And they're more than happy to add to the bill.</p><p>So a renewable portfolio standard, sure, put another couple $100 million onto that. You want solar, yes, we'll put another $50 million to $100 million onto that. You want energy efficiency programs funded by the state, sure, we'll put another $50 million or $100 million on that. So they don't seem to shy away from loading the bill up as long as they agree with what the money's being spent on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: I think even in this economic environment, they seem to be fairly constructive.</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: I think, and again it's the education that John talked about. To the extent that they understand what the issues are and they agree with the spend, they're willing to go along. Now, that's not without some complaining, but the dollars that are being pushed through to the customer, pretty substantial.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: (inaudible) opinion, is that a fair statement that generally you and the regulators seem to be in agreement on some either big ticket items or large CapEx spend?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: I think so. I mean, fundamentally, and I don't know why people have to be reminded of this every so often, but because it's so true is the jobs of the utility management and the jobs of the regulators are not that dissimilar. The mission, I mean, is not that dissimilar. You need -- everyone wants safe, reliable service at a reasonable price and in order to get that you'd have to be fair with the people that provide the capital for that business. And I think in Kansas, we are in a situation where it's constructive, and collaborative, and transparent, and they understand that.</p><p>So for example, for Westar some of the big ticket items are pollution controls on our coal plants, and a few years ago we went and explained to the regulators and the staff what was involved with that. They understand that issue and in fact they have allowed us to have an environmental cost recovery rider that addresses the return on that investment and the return of, i.e. depreciation on that investment without having to go through the inefficiencies, and the time lag, and the uncertainties, as well as just the cost of doing a rate case for such a single big ticket item. That's been in place now for three or four years. In fact, just this week on Monday we adjusted a sizeable adjustment to reflect the pollution control equipment we put in place last year. We increased our prices $32 million a year on Monday, and they understand what that's about. The consumer advocate even understands. Nobody likes to raise the prices, including us, but they understand it.</p><p>Similar, because of where we sit with regard to the opportunities for renewable energy and the tacit understanding that renewable energy without a transmission system makes no sense. Our legislature and endorsed through the commission by its action has allowed to adjust our prices for our transmission costs and service. So in fact, the Kansas Corporation Commission no longer makes the detailed rate setting on transmission. That's done at the FERC through a formula rate and then there's a rider on our retail build that just mirrors the change in that formula rate for the transmission cost of service. Now, not everything in the transmission cost of service is a big ticket item, but it is one of the areas where we're probably growing more progressively for the obvious reasons I think.</p><p>So those two big components of our cost of service, the regulators clearly understand what that is. They understand the importance of having timely and adequate rate recovery on that, and in fact have carved them out of the cost of service in a general rate case sort of way. So we are very conscious of what it means to raise prices on customers, particularly in a soft economy and we wouldn't quite view it the same way, Robert, that you said maybe your regulators are viewing it. We don't want to see our prices increase. So we do things to keep those price increases minimal and I think our regulators do as well.</p><p>So for example, when the cost of capital started shooting up, we cut back our construction budget. It's not because we couldn't raise that capital. It's because we don't want to raise that capital in a way that's dilutive and neither do we want to raise our prices to our customers at a time when they may be having a harder time paying for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Well, on that topic, and I think it's fortunate that we have four CFOs on the panel as well, although John I'll ask for your opinion on this too. We've seen it in the past, when an economic cyclical downturn occurs, a lot of your peers will have capital expenditures that are fairly high. They'd limit up the balance sheet a little bit and then all of a sudden the economy goes into a downward turn, and wouldn't you know it, in order to protect the credit rating you've got to issue equity.</p><p>Now, we've seen a couple of your peers already issue equity. We've seen a couple of rate deals that mandate equity issuances. Where do you think we are from an industry perspective in the cycle of the defense of the utility universe having to issue equity? Have we kind of gotten through the worst of it? Do you think we're still seeing more to come here? What do you think? Jim?</p><p>JAMES JUDGE: I guess it's a tough question for me because as I mentioned, we're already an A+, so we don't have any (inaudible) to issue equity to make our credit rating higher. I just think that obviously the tendency around the agencies has been more downgrades than upgrades. So I do think there's some balance sheet repair that needs to go on in the industry. But I feel very good about our cap structure currently. We don't have, like Robert, we don't really have any big ticket items.</p><p>We have kind of a maintenance level capital budget. The only big ticket is in the transition budget, which can flex based on projects (inaudible). We're a partner with them on that Hydro Quebec project. So we have some transmission opportunities, but again the balance sheet is strong enough, the cash flow is strong enough that we have no intentions of issuing equity in the near term or the long-term basis.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Mark, your thoughts on where are we in the industry in terms of equity issuances?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: Well, I think it's very much a case by case point of view, and I can only speak to Westar's case. We had a very substantial construction program and still do, but scaled much back in light of the more recent events in the capital market. We're a small company. Our market cap's probably $2 billion. We issued over $500 million of equity in 2007 and 2008 and we're pleased to have done so at the time we did. And at the time, people said, well gosh, that's really a lot. You don't need it all right now, but we have a little bit different philosophy in our businesses.</p><p>We implicitly acknowledge that we cannot predict the future, and as a result of that it dictates behavior, and for us it has dictated flexibility. And that means you raise capital when it's cheap and you don't spend it and require it when it's (inaudible). And so we were able -- we didn't want to back ourselves in a corner and just hope the capital system was going to be cheap. So we financed our capital program all along the way and raised $500 million, and spent pretty aggressively, but then absolutely pulled in our horns last year when capital costs got so much higher. In our case, that's, I think that has bred trust and goodwill with the ratings agency.</p><p>Fitch upgraded us in August. S&amp;P upgraded us on our unsecured rating in November. We just recently went from stable to positive and are not feeling pressure from the ratings agencies to do more. And in large part, that's because the best way to determine when someone's going to do is what they have done, and they've seen us pull in our horns and reduce our capital program, and keep it flexible enough so that we don't back ourselves in a corner and have to raise capital when it's most expensive, and then turn around and have to raise rates when it's maybe most inconvenient and difficult on our customers.</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: At Southern California Edison, it has lots of big projects and tremendous growth, and right now we're seeing growth anywhere from the 10% to 13% compounded annually and rate-based growth. And the biggest swing factor for us in terms of seeing potential equity in our future is, will we have transmission projects built in the timeframe that we currently have filed. And we have seen year-after-year as of late, transmission projects taking longer than we thought possible.</p><p>And so what we tried to do for the investing world is show what we think. We tried to give basically a base case and a low case of capital expenditures and the thing that really swings for us in terms of what, if we're on that higher edge versus the lower edge, is when things are at for transmission. And if you ride at the higher edge of the capital expenditures there's a possible need for equity. And at this point in time, clearly we don't want to issue equity in these kind of markets. It's not something that we find attractive at these prices.</p><p>We haven't allowed our leverage to increase because the Public Utilities Commission of California mandates a certain equity ratio at 48%. So we have to maintain that. That's the guiding rule. We may put some short-term debt on the balance sheet to defer any kind of need that we might possibly have until the markets are more attractive. So it's the transmission expenditures that really drive the potential need for if we're going to see any equity at Edison International.</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: Two thoughts. One is, having done this for 15 or 20 years, the financial institutions consistently overestimate the equity need. So I'm always amazed when they come around with their little banker books and they say, God, you got to have 87 trillion dollars worth of equity in this sector. And it never shows up, and it never shows up because I think the math just isn't real clean. The second part which I think is part of the under estimation process is we actually do, as an industry, respond to the economy.</p><p>And so there was some very high quality research reports that came out last fall that said CapEx is coming down in the sector. Well, yes, it's going to come down in the sector. You have industrial growth off 20% in the Midwest, you're going to have less CapEx in the Midwest. So we do have sort of a natural hedge in our financing, if you will. If we're responding to what our customers need, we're going to need less when the economy is bad and we're going to need more when the economy is good, and hopefully the economy and that markets don't get too disconnected.</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL: I couldn't agree more. The only thing I'll say next, if you ask it from an industry standpoint, we're a very, very capital intensive industry. And the infrastructure we have in place today, regardless of whether you're in a rate freeze or not, is aging. So there will be a lot of investment in this industry when things come back, (inaudible) Robert that they come back, and we're in a position that does well. We're going to have to capitalize the firms to be able to handle that.</p><p>So just as an industry, many of reports have us all spending several billion dollars as an industry a year to make this happen. And I think we're going to need to. I mean I think of, particularly in Michigan, if we get electrification of vehicles, that means the distribution opportunity that probably none of us have experience before. The dependency of customers on us not only for their household and their business, but also for their transportation.</p><p>And there's a lot of potential investment out there, and if we take the aging infrastructure that we have, and we've got the dubious distinction of having the oldest fossil fleet in the country. So I mean, either we keep that going or we change it and use something different. So I think even though I absolutely agree with your estimates, what we've seen from the banks. We'll be spending some money and we'll need to capitalize (inaudible).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Thanks, going back to what you were talking about, because this came up actually in a few of other panels where we would talk about the aging infrastructure, everything needs to be replaced, the changing dynamics of supplied gas on the pipeline's result, transmission for renewables, oil pipelines. From your guy's perspective, when was the last time we had this sort of push on infrastructure and CapEx in the industry? I mean it's a big change from what it was five, six, seven years ago. But if you had to go back in time, where would you peg this sort of event to previous historical events?</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: I think, you want to go around this away?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Sure.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: I'll tell you the difference I've seen now, and I've been in the business about 30 years, what I've seen different now is used to grow to be able to meet the load. Today, we're growing to meet mandates. In other words, environmental mandates, whether it's renewable energy optimization, emission controls, the transmission requirements we talked about. Many of the requirements we have today are driven by standards that we need to meet. Aging infrastructure, I guess that's up to us whether we try to do it or not, but many of the utilities have standards for performance that the commission sets to ensure good reliability for customers.</p><p>So that's the difference I see today and going forward with things that we must do. I think the environmental controls that we talked about earlier are a good example of it, that you need to meet it, it's a pass through cost. We need to move forward with it. So I think those are really the drivers now that I hadn't seen in years part.</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: I would say for context, if you think about the electrification in the United States, it's easy for us young people to say, oh it's always been here, but Con Ed, the city utility in the 1960s and early 1970s, unit volume growth was 7% per year. We were putting in half a dozen substations per year. We had a boom in the last five years. The peak year we put three in. So there's been dramatically higher spending relative to the base in the past. Now, those of us that are young may not remember that. We were probably walking around in diapers or trying to get through kindergarten, but that doesn't mean that it didn't happen.</p><p>I think what's different this time around, and it's also a little tougher to grasp, is because a lot of our business has grew dramatically post World War II when electrification was big in large parts of this company. That means that we have a lot of facilities that are 60 years old and we have engineers that are really good at milking equipment for a long period of time, running it to fail, fixing it, and running it to fail again. A lot of these assets now are to the point where they failed enough. They're not really used and useful anymore, and that's what driving the spend in the big city distribution system.</p><p>JAMES SCILACCI: A comparison I guess would be when we went and built all our nuclear plants back in the late '70s and early '80s, there was dramatic growth across the nation. And I think it's a little different from then, because if you remember back then in some of the states, we had AFUDC earnings, non-cash earning. And so we were issuing stock to pay the dividend, and from a financial perspective that, I don't think, was as healthy. And today most of what we're building doesn't have AFUDC, large AFUDC components. So you have real cash earnings versus non-cash. So I think it's fundamentally different. It's higher today on a relative basis, very high when we did the nukes. But it is proportionally higher given for inflation than it was then.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: We're going to go ahead and open this up to one question from the audience in the interest of time. Any questions here for managing regulatory risk during a recession?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible question - microphone inaccessible)</p><p>JOHN RUSSELL: I'll be glad to start. What we did in Michigan is we passed energy legislation a few years ago and for a real big ticket item, new nuclear plant, new coal plant, not environmental. But what we were able to do at that point is we will go through a process that will ensure that what we're building, the cost of what it costs to build, the amount of capital we need to spend is prudent. And that will continue as being prudent through any regulatory body, and that's the assurance that we need to move forward with those investments.</p><p>As was mentioned earlier in the growth base, you didn't have to worry about it because the growth was there to cover it. But when the growth wasn't there or there was cost overruns, that's what's caused the prudence issue.</p><p>What we're doing in Michigan is moving forward to get the agreement ahead of time before we make those large capital investments. Most of the other investments we make are done on an incremental basis. So those will risk the prudency as long as we align and communicate with the regulators beforehand.</p><p>ROBERT HOGLUND: As you probably remember, Vic, I started with the thesis, when I started in this job, I started with the thesis that T&amp;D was lower risk than a generation into the business because we don't have big, chunky projects that can easily overrun and therefore are high priority partners for regulators. And part of my education has been, a good regulator can find a way to go after almost anything.</p><p>So we currently have capital review for 2005 to 2008 underway for the New York Public Service Commission where they assert that because we spent $1.6 billion over that three year period more than what they allowed in rates, that we may potentially have a prudence issue. And they're very keen to forget the evidentiary record in the case in which we asked for $1.1 billion more than they granted, and we think we have a pretty good justification why the incremental $500 million reflects largely commodity cost increases.</p><p>So I think it's a tricky issue. Having said that, I think a lot of the spend now is on either mandates like environmental, where I think the relationship between the regulator and the regulated is a little different, or it's on the distribution end of the business where the items are smaller, and I think the prudence risk per force is necessarily smaller as well. So there's I think a better dynamic this time around, but I would not tend to believe that prudence isn't an issue.</p><p><person><nameText>MARK RUELLE</nameText></person>: I'll take a stab at this, Vic. One, as John indicated, we too in Kansas have a statutory predetermination standard. So it means you get agreement before you go out and spend a bunch of dough, and that helps, and I think that helps everybody. It helps regulators, it helps politicians, and it certainly helps investors and management. But even aside from that, as I indicated earlier, the concept of flexibility in an uncertain environment, I mean it's a religion to us. Because many of us are old enough to remember the last round of base load construction in a big way where there were prudency issues.</p><p>One of my colleagues is fond of saying, and I think he's right, when you decide to build a base load plant, you're going to be right and wrong in that decision five times before the plant goes commercial. And if the lumps of capital are so big and you're put in a situation where it's a she loves me, she loves me not game, and you got to hope that she loves you, well the day the plant goes commercial you put your regulators, you put your investors in a pretty tough situation.</p><p>So what we decided about three years ago is to really work the value of the flexibility in our wholesale contract portfolio, take advantage of our geography with renewables, take advantage of the fact that we have a very small natural gas exposure relative to the rest of the industry, and that we've got an environment where socially, politically, environmentally, people want transmission. And we have a policy environment where we can sight transmission in 120 days. And we've put together a portfolio of supply resource --</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

Topics include technology companies, e-sports, data privacy, competition and other technology sector and policy developments.</p><p>The podcast was recorded on the sidelines of TPI's annual Aspen Forum on August 20. Wallsten began the podcast by asking what each guest thinks about national policymakers' handling of technology issues in Washington.</p><p>\"I think [policymakers] are late,\" said Laura Martin, citing competition between platform aggregators, as they get into each other's businesses and many seek to enter video. \"The government is saying they are monopolies well that may have been true two years ago.</p><p>\"The FAANGs [Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google] are the past,\" Martin said. \"They got big and now they are being looked at. But the thing that is going to get big based on consumer time will get ignored until it gets really big and hurtful [and] people are writing letters.\"</p><p>Like Martin, Sullivan says the marketplace is changing very quickly. \"The 18-year-old in America isn't googling, he's playing Fortnite\" while ordering pizza through Siri, he said.</p><p>Martin predicts significant market shifts, including likely tech company failures, because, among other reasons, \"eSports and the rise of video game dominance in five years is going to have taken over consumers' time.\"</p><p>Concerning federal and state collaboration on potential government investigations of technology companies-a breaking news story Brian Sullivan advanced that morning during his on-stage, Aspen Forum interview of DOJ antitrust czar Makan Delrahim-Sullivan said, \"Antitrust takes so long that by the time [a case is] over, [the decision] is almost irrelevant.\"</p><p>You can listen to the episode and others on TPI's blog.

It replaced a photo of democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang[2] with VC Geoff Yang. The network, which soon apologized for the mistake, also used a photo of Kirsten Gillibrand[3] in place of Tulsi Gabbard[4]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[5]. Being part of the \"Yang Gang\" took on a new meaning for the cofounder of Silicon Valley venture capital firm Redpoint Ventures on Monday. </p><p>Geoff Yang, the partner who founded the Menlo Park, Calif.VC firm two decades ago, surprised many of his peers on Monday when his face appeared in a chart on TV news network CNBC alongside Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and the other candidates for the 2020 US presidential elections. While CNBC noted that Yang had raised $16.5 million in the fourth quarter for his campaign, the network had the wrong face, mistakenly identifying the VC investor for Andrew Yang, who also has a tech background and is running under the slogan to \"Make America Think Harder.\"[6] Predictably, the snafu caused widespread mirth on Twitter. Yang's Press Secretary Erick Sanchez tweeted out the screengrab, saying \"I see Andrew Yang every day, and I can't remember him ever looking like this.\"Tweet Embed: //twitter.com/mims/statuses/1214202682854060032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw I see Andrew Yang every day, and I can't remember him ever looking like this. pic.twitter.com/bQF4ZHXY1l[7]Geoff Yang, who sits on AT...]'s board, also reacted on Twitter[9]. He wrote \"Ummm. This is @geoff_yang[10] and I am NOT running for President.\" CNBC also mixed up candidate Tulsi Gabbard, replacing her photo with former candidate Kirsten Gillibrand. The network soon apologized[11] for the mistake. In an email to Business Insider, Geoff Yang declined to comment on who he is supporting in the 2020 race. \"No comments, but I have gotten hundreds of emails and texts some offering donations! Funny, but makes it hard to get any work done,\" he said. Andrew Yang first gained attention for his $1,000 per month universal basic income[12] proposal. Some supporters initially saw his campaign as a meme or a joke[13], but he's outlasted several more establishment candidates, including Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand. He has not yet qualified[14] for the January debate.NOW WATCH: Watch Elon Musk unveil his latest plan for conquering Mars[15]See Also: A new anti-robocall law pummels spam callers with fines and

This groundbreaking event will take place on March 28, 2018, in New York City in an effort that includes a world-class advisory board to help guide our editorial efforts. The will be coupled with TV and digital content before, during and after the conference.</p><p>Why Healthy Returns? Health care spending in the United States accounts for about 18 percent of our GDP, reaching $3.2 trillion in 2015, or $9,990 for every man, woman and child. There has certainly been no shortage of news coverage about the debate in Washington over the ACA/Obamacare, but Healthy Returns is not solely focused on policy or politics. Rather, we will be applying our distinctive CNBC lens to the business of health care, focusing on the most exciting innovations and investment opportunities.</p><p>Biotech, pharmaceutical and insurance companies, and those who invest in them, face unique challenges. From an uncertain regulatory environment to the exigencies of clinical trials, this is an industry rife with risk. But along with that risk, of course, is the possibility for big rewards, both clinically and financially. We are witnessing an extraordinary moment as precision medicine, gene editing and new approaches to immunotherapy, coupled with ever-increasing computing power, begin to lead to therapies that just a few years ago seemed totally out of reach.</p><p>Silicon Valley is now getting into the act, too, as , and circle. Big tech and well-funded start-ups are seeking to revolutionize everything from how we monitor and measure our health (wearables) to how we deliver treatment (surgical robots and smart pills). Whats clear is that health care is going through a period of rapid and significant medical and technological transformation.</p><p>The Healthy Returns advisory board will help guide our efforts in covering this transformation. Among those on the board: entrepreneurs such as Anne Wojcicki, founder and CEO of 23andMe, the hot genetic testing and analysis service; philanthropists such as Sean Parker, founder of Napster and founding president of Facebook who is now chairman of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, and Gates Foundation CEO Susan Desmond-Hellmann; leading medical technologists such as Dr. Eric Topol, one of the countrys leading voices on the use of genomics to drive transformative research; and top investors and executives such as Fred Hassan, special limited partner at Warburg Pincus and former CEO of Schering-Plough.

I know you have thoughts some of these big issues. I want to get right to. I want to get right to it before we get to the substance can we just get to what I regard as being the blather, any reflections on last night since. At one point, the President did invoke I've learned my lesson here and Boca name that I didn't think was correct.Senator Warren: So, you know, my reaction last night is Donald Trump demonstrated again why he should not be President of the United States of America. </p><p>And look, you didn't have to watch the whole thing. All you had to do was just see that little clip, when he was asked to denounce white racism. Right, white supremacy. And what did he say he told the proud boys to stand by. That should do it for every person in this country. That is not the America that we want to be the America we want to be is an America that lifts up all of us that creates opportunity for all of us. Donald Trump just made it clear that's not who he is. And just in case that didn't seal the deal. His closer. That sounded a lot like to me that he was encouraging his supporters to go out and engage in voter intimidation, to keep American citizens from voting and getting their votes counted. That one really should have done it. So, you know, in that sense, to me, really short debate, two clips right there where Donald Trump made it clear that he cannot be trusted. As the leader of our nation.Cramer: Okay, understood. And I think that there's an American way. And I think that we all deal with the American ways so now let me get to something that you are the expert on. I am struggling with your views, because your views actually are very similar to what I regard is Ronald Reagan's views, actually when it comes to the disparity of wealth between CEOs and workers but I need to know do you think that it's possible, like, Marc Benioff from Salesforce says that business can be the greatest force for social change.Senator Warren: I believe that we can make change. But let's be clear about this. We live in a democracy and the whole premise behind that is it's one person, one vote. And that's how we're going to create a set of rules that work for all of us right it's that simple. But notice I could hear you before I came on and what were you talking about you're talking about Donald Trump's taxes. Right. And you were doing this fine lawyerly conversation about. Did he evade or avoid right did he stay on this side of the line, or that side of the line, frankly, Jim, it's the wrong question. The question is, how did we end up with a tax system that lets Donald Trump claim to be earning millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars. And it's a baby. Here are the loopholes that Donald Trump and people just like Donald Trump can slice through. How did we end up in an America where the average nurse pays what 15, 18 $20,000 in taxes the average teacher pays that kind of money in taxes that workers across this nation, literally, they paid 10s of thousands of dollars in taxes. People have quite moderate incomes middle class America, but Donald Trump can pay $750 in taxes. The problem here is that the system itself is broken and you gotta ask why and you want to know why. The reason is because of the Donald Trump's of the world. The people who have used their money and used their influence to get Congress to keep rewriting those laws, you know it's not like a bunch of lawmakers woke up one day and said, Gosh, we can help up nurses and teachers and and and and people who stopped grocery store shelves, or we could help out real estate developers, I know, let's give everything to the real estate developers and take it all away from everyone else. That's what's wrong with the system. It is the capture of government by the rich and powerful to make themselves richer and more powerful.Cramer: Senator Warren you're there. Is there a way to actually break the stranglehold you're you are fabulous professor, and you understood the code. You know how hard the code is what happens if you took a regular approach and just said you know what the code is no good. And what we're going to do is have everybody pay the same tax on everything, real estate stock, it doesn't matter. It's simple we make the code, two pages, America becomes a richer wealthier and absolutely more distributed, a distributed country. And I think you and I would agree that that's the way that should be the American way.Senator Warren: I'm all for rewriting the tax code, are you kidding, I mean, let's go. But the point is, we've got to break the influence of rich folks who make their voices heard, not a little bit, not a medium sized amount, not even a huge amount. They make their voices heard in Washington louder than anything else, you know, what was the one legislative achievement of Donald Trump, and the republicans do remember the one thing they managed to get through Congress, a trillion dollar tax cut that went largely to millionaires and billionaires and giant corporations and remember all those promises they made about what it was going to do for the economy and so you remember what the one thing actually did that you can measure is that it drove down revenues for the government to be able to run everything else. And, and that's the thing. Jim about this. It's not just that Donald Trump doesn't pay taxes, it's somebody else has to pay to keep this country going. Somebody has to pay for the roads and bridges. Somebody has to pay for the military. Somebody has to pay to keep our country working and nurses pay a big share teachers pay a big share grocery store clerks pay a big share and Donald Trump, just pays a tiny little bit. And that's because why money,Cramer: Do you still believe strongly in your idea that there should be a levy on accumulated wealth and your two cents on the dollar 2% on the porch is about 50 million to half a percent about 1 billion is that a way to get at it.Senator Warren: Sure. It's one of the ways we can do. Come on, Jim, people have been paying wealth taxes across this country forever. They're just usually called property taxes. And all I'm saying is for the top one 10th of 1% this tiny little fraction at the top, to say you know what, when you pay your wealth tax, it's not all just real estate for you. Let's include the stock portfolios and the diamonds and the rimbrant and give us just two cents, three cents if you're a billionaire on the dollar. And that will produce enough money because ultimately it's who's gonna pay that would give us enough money to provide child care for every baby in this country age zero to five universal pre K, it would give us enough money to pump billions of dollars into K 12 enough money to cancel student loan debt enough money to put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities and enough money to make four years at a public institution tuition free for every kid who wants to get an education, technical school two year college four year college in other words, what it means to sense and invest in a whole generation of young people, we could build such a future in this country.Cramer:\u00a0 Well let me push back in a realistic way, but you're talking about a Jeff Bezos paying huge amount you're talking about a Steve Ballmer pay huge amount you're talking about very powerful people. Mark Zuckerberg paying huge amount. These are people who are going to fight you tooth and nail they have incredible resources, what do you do, do you just decide, you know what I am going to beat these guys. Senator Warren, they have unlimited firepower.Senator Warren: \u00a0Wow, did you hear what he just said, This is about power. And you've just said, Be realistic in this democracy in 2020 boy folks in Washington, need to listen to Jeff Bezos because he's rich and not listen to the school teacher or the nurse or the grocery store clerk, because after all, they're not. That is not how democracy is supposed to work. And I'll tell you this, when you know thatCramer:\u00a0 you don't. I mean, you understand that. Look, I, I want the school teachers I want to go back to the senator wittings day when I was doing. He was my professor, where we want to do guaranteed income for all these people with no taxes i mean i think that these people would should even that was Nixon's plan I mean, he'll think about the people I'm talking about, you know, Nixon favored higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for the poor, or for the working poor Reagan favored higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for the working poor. What the hell happened in our country that two of the most, I mean you can't you're supposed to mention Nixon but you know both of those presidents favored a better redistribution that we have now, how'd that happen.Senator Warren: \u00a0Well partly Citizens United. It's corruption in Washington. It's the influence of money and understand it absolutely is it's about money for campaign contributions, but it is so much more. It is about the lobbyists, it's about the bought and paid for think tanks. It's about the experts who are taking money from the rich folks and from the industries. It's about these industry groups. It's about the fact that big businesses and billionaires have figured out, they're gonna make more return on their money by investing in twisting the rules in Washington to help them. And to help them keep more of their money, help them deregulate so that they can externalize their costs. They figured that out and they are just pushing them. The pedal to the metal on this. But I tell you Jim I'm not giving up.Cramer: I know you're not, I know you favorite breaking up tech little lightning round here, what do we do with alphabet, Google.Senator Warren: Got to break it got to break these guys up. And the reason for this understand on every one of them. The very best part of what we can make work in this economy is when you've got markets that are working. And that means you got to have competition. So these guys who engage in these anti-competitive practices, the guys who engage in monopolistic practices, the guys who crush or buy up their competitors and just keep getting bigger, understand this. It's not only what they're doing. It's what they're doing to the rest of the market. It means we'll lose the vibrancy in the market, it means we lose the creativity, you've got a great idea, but you're going to go up against Amazon, you've got a terrific notion but you're going to be up against Google Good luck to you. And that's the whole point. that's the role of government, it's to blow the whistle and say these guys when they get too big when they get too dominant in market. Nope, can't do that. Got to break them apart, and get more competition going Cramer: ok well how about the banks, I mean we're hearing, we'll get there isn't a day that goes by that we don't read about a giant fine, which of course is paid by the shareholders senator, we read about how they may not be able to find the limited pool of black talent at these banks I mean we're, which of course is wrong. I don't understand how the banks, stay this size when they obviously can't Avoid chicanery.<br/>Senator Warren: No and what you are exactly right. Part of this lay, again, at the feet of the bank regulators who are far more interested in watching out for the banks and helping them make sure that they get plenty of profits. But part of this is laid truly at the feet of our willingness to let the giants call the shots in Washington. And that's true whether you're talking about banking or you're talking about tech, or you're talking about big AG. It's the power and the money of these giants who are here. Who are saying, 'no, no, no. We like business as usual. You know, every time someone talks about nothing ever happens in Washington, you know, except that giant tax cut that Trump got through, and they use words like gridlock. Understand, this isn't about gridlock. This is about the system works great for those giants. Because nobody's in there to say we're going to enforce the antitrust laws, or we're going to toughen the antitrust laws, or we're going to stitch up those tax loopholes. And that's what we got to do.Cramer: Okay, so let's think about this for a second. You ran for President. Everything you articulated was right there. I know a huge number of young people, I don't know as many older people I know a huge number of young people who swear by you. Why did you not win the nomination?Senator Warren: Well, I wish I knew the answer to that one, but I lost. But look, I'm not sorry I ran because the things I argued for are still out there. The problems we have are still every bit as big as they were. Indeed, with this COVID-19, it has even gotten bigger. Inequality in this country, I talked about it every day when I was out on the trail. But look what we see now. Communities of color hit disproportionately hard by COVID-19. Just peel back that layer just a little bit and what do people start to understand finally? This has to do with generations of systemic racism, and it has to do with a black white wealth gap, a health gap, an entrepreneurship opportunity gap, an education gap, a housing gap. Racism that has pervaded the system and kept us from being the America that we should be.Cramer: And Senator, you left one out, of which I agree with all those, but you left one out. Gender diversity, okay. How about this statistic that I got from I'm familiar with because I used to own it. We are number 17 in the world in the percentage of female board members. How pathetic is that given the fact that women run 40% of the household spend -- of their finances, but almost 100% of their buying. How did this number occur? Why is that number occuring?Senator Warren: So look, we know the data on this. And that is folks who've got power, don't give it up easy Jim. If you're part of the club, you keep that power close and that means we have a lot of white men who are holding on to the power they've got and they don't plan to share it. They don't plan to share it with women, they don't plan to share it with African Americans, they don't plan to share it with Native Americans, they don't plan to share it with Latinos. That's the way this works. But here's the thing, Jim, there's more votes Cramer: But here's what confuses me. I know you and you understand markets. The most highest-rated, meaning the highest PE multiple stock, in the food group is McCormick, which also has the greatest diversity in the boardroom of any company in the food group. Now, is that not cut and dried? That if you want to do well, you become diverse. So what are these people missing? I didn't call them clowns out of respect of last night's debate. Why is it that these people at these boards don't look at McCormick and say, 'hey you know what? They're the most diverse. Most women, most Latino, most African American and they are doing better than everyone else. Why can't people see that? You and I see it.Senator Warren: You know Jim, I'm just going to underline your point because I think you're so right on this. I think that the evidence showed coming out of the 2008 crash that companies that had more than one woman on their board, companies that had women in well placed positions in the U.S. and around the world, those companies did better. They did better in terms of not crashing so hard and making it out faster on the other side. It is the reminder that you don't pull together a diverse team out of some notion of trying to engage in charity for someone. You pull together a diverse team, because a diverse team is what will make you strong. It is what will make you profitable. It is what will make your country -- your company robust and make your country strong. So, you do it out of but that's not how these guys look at it. You know, sometimes it takes getting a little bit out of your comfort zone, running the risk of making a mistake. And a lot of folks don't want to do that. Not the guys who already had the power.Cramer: You have proposed something that is so brilliant. Small business equity fund. A fund to close the gap, create 100,000 new minority businesses, your price tag is only 7 billion. Senator Warren why isn't that done right now?Senator Warren: No kidding.Cramer: Let's get it done.Senator Warren: Let me just lay it down so I'm sure everybody's following on this. So, what the data show is a lot of people talk about that Black-owned businesses need access to be able to borrow more money. But when you look at the comparisons with Black-owned businesses and white-owned businesses, what you see is it is no. They need some seed money, they need some equity to get them started and to cushion them in the early parts of getting those businesses launched. And that equity usually comes from accumulated family wealth. And where does that come from? It comes from homeownership. So, watch what happens here, Jim. For decades, decades in America, African Americans were just largely cut out the opportunity to buy homes. It was redlining. And cut out of the federally insured mortgages. And that wasn't just an idea. It was literally the law of the United States into the mid-1960s. So, as white families were building up more wealth through their homes, and building up more intergenerational wealth that is you know if grandma and grandpa could stay in the home until they died, they pass it on to the grandchildren or when they sold it there be a little more for the next generation -- that becomes the spur to be able to start a successful small business. African Americans just got cut out of that. For $7 billion, we could close that gap and African Americans, people of color who have been cut out for generations, would have the same kind of opportunity not just to start a small business but to start it and help it succeed.Cramer: Who's fighting that, Senator Warren? Who is fighting something that I think, again, is the American way? Which is equal opportunity, it's in the Constitution. You know the Constitution better than anyone who ran for President because you were a tremendous professor of law. I don't get who could be against something that is deeply ingrained within the Constitution.Senator Warren: Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump, every single sitting Republican senator that enables Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump. And I'll tell you exactly how. Every proposal, like that, that I put on the table and others put on the table, cannot get a vote in a Republican controlled Senate. I can't even get it out there for a floor debate to talk about what it would mean, and to be able to bring in Republicans and Democrats to vote for it. Mitch McConnell refuses to bring an idea like that, a bill like that and so many others, to the floor for a vote, and it goes back to what we talked about earlier. Why? Because he is there to serve the interests of the richest and most powerful. And if you put $7 billion of taxpayer money into equalizing entrepreneurial opportunity for people of color and for whites that's $7 billion that's going to have to come out of maybe their taxes. And they don't want any part of it. And besides that, they don't want the competition. They like things the way they are.Cramer: I want to leave a constructive note. Once again, what companies do the best? Take a company like Constellation Brands. They own Modelo and they own Corona. What do they do? They set up a fund for Latinos who have good ideas for any beverage. There. Why do they do it? Do they do it just because they are kind? Well, they happen to be kind, but they do it because they make more money for shareholders. How do we in a constructive way you and me get this done? How do we tell the tale that if you are more diverse, if you help minorities, if you invest in the community, you are going to have a higher stock price? That is true, Senator Warren. How do we get it out?Senator Warren: So, I love it. You keep talking about it, but understand this, Jim. Our responsibility is to change our government so it isn't just working for the rich and the powerful. We want to build opportunity in this nation. Opportunity for everyone. Not opportunity that is different depending on the color of your skin, or your gender, or who you love. We want to build opportunity. That's what builds the best America. And the way we do that is we build opportunity by making these kinds of investments. By understanding how racism and sexism and anti-Muslim attitudes have kept people from having those chances. It is the job of our government to say we're all going to pitch in a little so every kid gets a chance to build a future in this nation.Cramer: Senator Warren, I want to thank you so much. I think a lot of what you talked about is called again, I use the term American way, because that's how we grew up. That's what we learned. Somehow it got a little off track, but I know that you have strong convictions and a lot of these ideas. I'm sure there's pushback from hedge fund managers, pushback from the people at these big tech companies, but I think these must be discussed and never forget If you want your stock price higher be diverse. Thank you so much, Senator Warren. Always great to talk to you.Senator Warren: Always great talking to you, Jim. Take care.

The following is a link to video from the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/11/13/department-of-justices-antitrust-chief-on-regulating-big-tech.html . DAVID FABER: Welcome back to \"Squawk on the Street.\" I'm David Faber here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. I'm very excited to introduce our guest this morning, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division: Makan Delrahim, a man I have not seen since we were together in the spring at the Milken Institute Annual Meeting. Very nice to have you for an official interview here this morning. </p><p>And, Makan, let me get right to it. I can't remember a period of time, certainly, in the recent past where we've had more discussions, at least, both at the executive level by the president, but generally speaking as well, about the power of big business, in particular the power of some of our key technology companies. You're no stranger to what's going on in the news from your perch at the Department of Justice. How seriously do you think about \"the power of big,\" if I could put it that simply, and what it actually means from an anti-trust perspective? MAKAN DELRAHIM: Well, we've discussed this before. You know, one of our roles in the anti-trust laws is to make sure that the - you know, when companies get big - and we want to - we don't have any problem with companies being big, it's when they get big, they behave properly. And to make sure that the markets are open; that new entrants enter in, new competitors and ultimately the consumers and businesses will benefit from that. FABER: I'm sure you may have seen this article. Interestingly -- there's been lots of good press for our interview, not to mention the president which we'll get to. But Tim Wu, a law professor that specializes in anti-trust, New York Times editorial this weekend, talked about Congress passing the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 but he also said, \"It would be understandable if you assumed it had been repealed. But it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding\" what he says is, \"hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary.\" How do you respond to criticisms like that? DELRAHIM: Well look I respect him quite a bit. He's great. He has been very thoughtful. He has been certainly thoughtful on the At T/Time Warner Merger that we challenged. I don't think there has been much hostility. I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated. Do we have challenges? Absolutely. But I think those are good challenges and checks and balances on our powers. We go to the court system. We have to prove our case. We have to prove it with good, strong evidence. We also have to prove it with sound economics. And over the last 30, 40 years, we've had pretty strong and bipartisan consensus on the -- what the balance, and the right balance for anti-trust enforcement is. Now, are there areas that, you know -- do we wish he'd go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely. FABER: Right. But do you agree with his contention then, and I'll read here, that \"there's a direct link between the concentration of business and the distortion of the democratic process\"? DELRAHIM: I don't think so. We have to be vigilant, make sure. That's why the anti-trust laws were enacted in the first place, to make sure that no single company or group of companies have the inordinate amount of power. That affects our lives. And there's been quite a bit of debate about these platforms, and what does that mean? Are they touching every aspect of our lives? Should they be this big? Should the government step in and somehow regulate their growth? And I think - you know, the anti-trust - FABER: How close do you look at that issue when it comes to, in particular -- and again, we're talking about platforms, whether it be Amazon, Facebook or Alphabet, the existence of these enormous platforms and the influence they have? How seriously do you investigate it right now at the Department of Justice in terms of trying to get some answers? DELRAHIM: Well, we look at it. Whenever there's been challenges, we have -- the Justice Department brought a case on the eBooks matter not too long ago - just a couple of years ago, where some publishers and Apple had gotten together and successfully resolved that matter. We are constantly - what we look at we have to be careful in that we're just there to police the markets, we're not picking winners and losers. We are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly, we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure that markets are free for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones. FABER: And do you believe that's the case right now? I mean, we've had this discussion previously but this idea that innovation is somehow it's stymied by these giants who can conceivably presumably prevent capital flowing to new ideas because nobody wants to fund anybody getting into business to compete with them? DELRAHIM: Well, I don't know if that's true. I don't know if there's actual evidence of that. There might be in certain areas, certainly different investors. But it seems like Silicon Valley and the venture capital world, in this country in particularly, is alive and well. You're having new companies pop up, every now and then. But that's what we do. Anti-trust laws need to be there to make sure that they do not prevent the next competitor to come in. That was exactly what the justice department did in Microsoft 20 years ago. And a lot of people were worried about the power Microsoft had, and particularly when they were trying to suffocate the internet browser because it was challenging their monopoly power in the operating system. And I think that case probably led to a lot of the innovation we're seeing today. FABER: How do you respond to the president's tweets? I'm sure you hear about them if you don't read them directly. Yesterday, American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast, our parent company, by the way. They say that Comcast routinely violates anti-trust laws. When you see or hear something like that, what's your reaction? DELRAHIM: Well, look, the previous administration you know, brought an anti-trust case against Comcast when they bought NBC and settled it in a decree that just expired in September. We have been vigilant, and I think I owe that to the American consumer to continue to make sure the markets are working, despite the expiration of any consent decree. You know, I have - one of the things I've been both criticized and, I think, praised for is that I don't believe these behavioral consent decrees as a solution to these mergers. We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make a profit and then they evaporate after five, seven, ten years. And it makes no sense. Because seven years before we're trying to guess where the market is. I believe in structural solutions. That's what we've suggested. We thought that's what it is -- FABER: -- that's why you went after AT T/Time Warner, the vertical merger that it was. DELRAHIM: Exactly. Yeah. Well only portions of it, not the whole merger. But the area where there was anti-competitive concern. And that was the solution we had provided. But that is one. But I think it's great that you know, you have the Administration, you also have members of Congress who are all very vigilant about anti-trust enforcement. And Comcast in particular, as well as At T and other media because they affect so many Americans' lives. FABER: But when the president writes, and this is from this summer, \"In my opinion, The Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive lobbyist for Amazon as it uses protection against anti-trust claims, which many feel should be brought.\" Again, as the man who runs enforcement for the anti-trust division, when you hear something like that from the executive, is there a response that you have? DELRAHIM: Well, we hear that from executive and legislative. I mean, by the way, these types of concerns raised about Amazon are bipartisan. And Senators raise them, the president has raised it. It's -- again, I think it's great that we have such a debate about free markets and the anti-trust laws there to protect the free markets. As far as what we do in our enforcement, you know, we need the evidence, we need the economics, we go to court. And politics, you know, that goes on between various aspects of the government don't affect our decisions to make these cases. FABER: In the couple of minutes we have left, Makan, let me hit a couple of quick things: Time Warner/AT T, when are you actually going to go to court again? DELRAHIM: The Court of Appeals in D.C. will be hearing the oral arguments December 6th. The parties, we had agreed with them to hold the Turner assets separate until the end of February and so they're supposed to be running that business a little bit separately so that in the event the court of appeals overturns the district court's decision as we argued -- and I think they should -- FABER: I know you think they should. Whether or not they will - DELRAHIM: Well, I think there's been a lot of support for our appeal. You know, you had those - the 29 or so economists, law professors, some of the country's biggest experts who supported our case because, frankly, the court's decision, and the lower court's decision had real serious flaws in economic logic. And so we'll see what happens there. If it does - but we hope there will be a decision before the end of February and then we'll take it from there. FABER: Talking about timelines. Can you give us any sense as to when the Department of Justice will complete its review of T-Mobile and Sprint's deal? DELRAHIM: A lot of times, these mergers, the parties control the timing - about the number of documents they provide. And in that particular transaction, we also - we're reviewing it, but also the Federal Communications Commission has a role in that transaction and I believe there's been a -- what they call the time clock over at the FCC for 180 days that has been stopped. I don't believe that has been restarted. So our timing will coincide together. I don't know exactly when it is, but, you know, I announced a number of reforms with the hope that if the parties cooperate with us, we'll be moving things forward and we hope to get every transaction reviewed within six months. FABER: Before going to three in the most important market for most people when it comes to the bill they pay, some would say simple violation of anti-trust law. DELRAHIM: Well, yes, except for simple violations of anti-trust law require evidence and the economics. So, we're reviewing the evidence in this case and if that's what the economics and the evidence shows, that it would substantially lessen competition, we would sue to block it. But if it doesn't, I don't think we have a magical number for any particular industry, which is what I've said in the past. FABER: Does leaving an enfeebled competitor worry you to act - sort of figure into your decision making? In other words, the idea that Sprint wouldn't ever be able to compete if it was truly left independent? DELRAHIM: That would certainly be one of the considerations that goes into a number of factors we would review to see, you know, what would happen to the competitive landscape. Does that -- what you're insinuating, does that mean there's only be then two competitors if this merger doesn't happen -- and one of them would fail or both of them might fail without this merger? Those would be factors we would consider. But I don't know if the evidence fully supports that. FABER: And, finally, your future. Some say, well, there's an opening now for Attorney General of the United States. Would you be interested? DELRAHIM: I have the best job, I think, in the government, running the anti-trust division. It's the job that I wanted. And I think the president has made a superb choice, as Deputy Rod Rosenstein said, in Matt Whitaker the acting Attorney General in the meantime. And I think there's gonna be a process, so I'm looking forward to see who will be the next AG. But as far me personally, I love the anti-trust division and I have the best job in the country. FABER: Well we appreciate your taking some time to talk about it with us. DELRAHIM: Thank you for having me. FABER: Makan Delrahim joining us. Back to you guys.

The Morena-led congress began work Sept. 1.</p><p>Asked what his chief concerns are now, Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas cited additional work needed to flesh out the regulatory 'sandbox' and rules surrounding the sharing of APIs (application program interfaces) - a key aspect of open banking.</p><p>Stressing it still needed work, Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas noted that Mexico's 'sandbox' - a term often used to describe an area for startups to experiment with innovative financial technology and get it to operational status before moving the platform into the fully regulated ecosystem - was already more agile than other models, noting that unlike Australia's, which is limited to use by fintechs, Mexico's 'sandbox' could be used to develop technology in any segment of the private sector.</p><p>He added that he envisaged specific challenges with banks in getting a broad agreement to share APIs on concerns over user data privacy and the potential loss of proprietary technology and information.</p><p>A 'big' concern</p><p>\"But more than all of than this, [my concern] has to with the big fintechs, or bigtechs,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas, referring to the incursion of massive retailers into the financial sector market space.</p><p>\"Who are we going to regulate [bigtechs], what's the role [of the regulator] going to be ... when all of a sudden there is Facebook, Google or Amazon decide to enter,\" said Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas at the event. \"They are going to generate very important effects on stability with respect to other institutions of the financial system, surely the banks will not be able to compete with these novel business models, which have a very large capital base.\"</p><p>\"We will have to see how they enter, but we must be very careful in regulating them and the effects they may have on finance,\" added the official.</p><p>Crowdfunding rules</p><p>The official noted that one of the major aspects of the secondary laws that went into effect Sept. 10 was to set place regulations on crowdfunding, with rules now placing caps on the total amounts that can be raised to between 300,000 pesos (US$16,000) to 10mn pesos, depending on the model and purpose of the crowdfunding application - levels which were higher than had been seen with existing fintech startups in Mexico, according to the official.</p><p>The reason those caps are in place, said Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas was to balance the fact that the government did not want to burden smaller startups with the intensive regulatory reporting requirements it places on major banks and other financial institutions due to the inhibitive cost on such small firms.</p><p>With big tech companies, this would not be the case, and the CNBV president said these firms would likely begin to enter the financial ecosystem more as a bank than as a fintech, though in the end, the next administration's officials would need to work with the commercial banking sector and fintechs to determine the proper regulation for bigtechs as hybrids with the capital muscle of big banks and the fintech mindset towards innovation and the digital transformation of financial services.</p><p>Pictured: CNBV president Bernardo Gonz\u00e1lez Rosas in March at an event to hail the passage of the primary legislation of the 'Ley Fintech'.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bnamericas.com/story.xsql?id_sector=3&amp;id_noticia=731985&amp;Tx_idioma=I&amp;source=\">http://www.bnamericas.com/story.xsql?id_sector=3&amp;id_noticia=731985&amp;Tx_idioma=I&amp;source=</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BNAMEN-7319852</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BNAMEN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T91-3B91-DYTB-Y0M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">256776</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><timeReceived>6:07 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 BNamericas.com, Inc.

The DOJ and Federal Trade Commission are said to be dividing up responsibility for oversight of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon. </p><p>Meanwhile, the House Judiciary Committee is launching a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of the tech industry, including those four companies, to examine their impact on local journalism, privacy and the competitive landscape for startups. </p><p>It's a difficult but familiar position for Google to find itself in. Over the last decade, European Union regulators moved forward with antitrust probes of Google's online search advertising business, shopping platform and Android dominance, resulting in three separate billion-dollar fines against the company. The FTC also pursued an antitrust investigation of Google --- a case that eventually closed in 2013 in what was seen as a clear victory for Google.</p><p>That scrutiny has forced Google to rethink strategies, including potential acquisitions. Pichai told CNN Business \"there have been times\" that Google has looked at an acquisition and determined it may not be possible because of concerns about \"too much concentration in a sector.\"</p><p>Pichai said it's \"perfectly fine\" for companies like Google to be scrutinized when they get big enough. \"Scrutiny is right, and we will participate constructively in these discussions,\" he said.</p><p>But he also stressed that \"scale does offer many benefits.\" Pichai noted that it's Google's size that allows it to invest in future technologies five to 10 years out without worrying about \"short-term profits.\" Perhaps for that reason, he said it's bigger tech companies that are investing heavily in areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing. </p><p>Pichai also sounded a similar note to Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, who have suggested that breaking up US tech companies could benefit businesses in China. Pichai, for his part, did not name China specifically. </p><p>\"There are many countries around the world which aspire to be the next Silicon Valley, and they are supporting their companies too. So we have to balance both,\" he said. \"This doesn't mean you don't scrutinize large companies, but you have to balance it with the fact that you want big, successful companies as well.\"</p><p>Even before the latest wave of antitrust investigation reports, there were calls to break up some of the tech companies from figures including Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes and Democatic senator and 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. </p><p>In an aggressive plan released in March, Warren said she would appoint regulators to \"unwind anti-competitive mergers,\" including Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick, an online advertising company it acquired in 2007. </p><p>\"I think there needs to be healthy debate,\" Pichai said when asked about Senator Warren's rhetoric. \"Any campaign has moments around that, but what matters to me is the healthy thoughtful conversations around it.\"</p><p>Pichai also raised concerns about the fallout of knee-jerk regulation of the technology industry. </p><p>\"I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, it has a lot of unintended consequences,\" he said, focusing on the issue of artificial intelligence in particular. \"It will have implications for our national security and ... for other important areas of society. Having leadership ends up being really critical.\"</p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In the process, Google says it will create 100 more jobs and support local schools. </p><p>Google began construction on the data center in 2007 and opened it in 2011. It currently has more than 400 full-time employees, whose work helps keep popular services like Gmail, YouTube and Google's search engine operational, according to the company. </p><p>\"This is one of our largest data centers,\" Pichai said in an exclusive interview with CNN Business' Poppy Harlow while walking through the facility. \"All the searches you do, when you find driving directions in maps, we make all of that happen through data centers like these.\"</p><p>In the interview, Pichai said Google's investment has \"had a real impact\" on this Oklahoma community. \"It attracts more investment and it drives a set of things around the community which creates a virtuous cycle,\" he said. </p><p>Another top Google exec delivered a similar message earlier this week. Ruth Porat, the CFO of Google and its parent company Alphabet, stopped in Michigan to announce a $17 million investment to expand its offices in Detroit and Ann Arbor. In a blog post, Porat said the investment would allow Google to \"significantly increase our local workforce in the coming years.\" The offices are currently hiring for a range of sales positions, according to Google's career page. </p><p>Google is also planning to announce an expansion in Texas soon. </p><p>The moves are part of a broader investment, announced in February, to expand Google's physical presence throughout the US and ultimately boost hiring. Google previously said it planned to invest $13 billion in data centers and offices in more than a dozen US states this year, which he claimed would pave the way for hiring tens of thousands of employees. </p><p>It represents a striking new trend for the Silicon Valley company. \"Last year was the first year when we added more people outside of California than within California,\" Pichai told CNN Business. And while some companies like Amazon are weighing second headquarters outside the Bay Area, Pichai says Google prefers to take a more \"distributed\" approach, with offices and operations sprinkled around the country. </p><p>\"This national expansion comes at a significant moment for Google,\" Pichai said in his remarks Thursday. \"For 21 years we've pursued a timeless mission: to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. In that time, we've evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that helps people throughout their day.\"</p><p>Other tech giants, such as Apple and Amazon, have also made splashy announcements about expanding their US footprints in recent years, including Amazon's very public search for a second headquarters. These investments may be fueled by the tech companies expanding into new markets and technologies, including cloud computing. </p><p>These moves came against the backdrop of a shifting political climate for the tech industry, with President Donald Trump accusing Amazon of not paying enough taxes and calling for Apple to make its products in the United States rather than in China. </p><p>The political pressure on Silicon Valley has only ratcheted up in recent weeks. </p><p>This month, the House Judiciary Committee launched a \"top-to-bottom\" antitrust probe of Big Tech and reports came out that two federal regulators are divvying up responsibility for oversight of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple.</p><p>The Department of Justice is said to be laying the foundation for a potential antitrust investigation of Google, with a focus on its search business. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

We are in Ohio tonight, because it's one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate, so to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.   </p><p>      Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.   </p><p>      When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.   </p><p>      Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.   </p><p>      Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren. You're all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any chance but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of -- worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.   </p><p>      And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, \"The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.\" With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice -- no choice -- but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.  </p><p>      This president -- and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders -- is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.   </p><p>      During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.   </p><p>      Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.   </p><p>      But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, \"moral vandalism\" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.   </p><p>      Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.   </p><p>      Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Booker.   </p><p>      Senator Klobuchar, you have -- what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.   </p><p>      He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.  </p><p>      So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.   </p><p>      It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  ... and I will not do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.   </p><p>      Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly -- in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.   </p><p>      We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.   </p><p>      Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.   </p><p>      But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.   </p><p>      It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be:  vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.   </p><p>      I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.   </p><p>      The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.   </p><p>      If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congresswoman.   </p><p>      Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.   </p><p>      Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.   </p><p>      It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.   </p><p>      The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  You know, I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard, those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.   </p><p>      And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  And we cannot do that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.   </p><p>      Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.   </p><p>      And what I wanted to make a point about -- and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.   </p><p>      On the -- look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions -- three occasions -- has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.   </p><p>      Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Anderson -- Anderson...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.   </p><p>      My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.   </p><p>      But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Mark?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  We want to move now to the economy.   </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX to the economy.   </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  May I get in, please?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  You've proposed some sweeping plans...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  ... free public college...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is wrong to move on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. We're going to -- Senator Warren.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  It is wrong to move on.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done 140 town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.   </p><p>      And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.  </p><p>      And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.   </p><p>      Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, \"evasive\" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.   </p><p>      No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.   </p><p>      But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.   </p><p>      Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.   </p><p>      We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.   </p><p>      I've been studying this, you know, for the biggest part of my life...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Can the -- can the...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... why people go bankrupt.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  ... mayor respond?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Sure.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.   </p><p>      And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I'd like to be able to respond...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.   </p><p>      At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \"Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.\"   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  \"We're not covering what you need.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.   </p><p>      I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in our years.  </p><p>      And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Warren?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of health care.   </p><p>      And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... Americans from going bankrupt over health care costs.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.   </p><p>      But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.   </p><p>      We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio, that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  I'd like to be...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Let me -- let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  First of all, the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare, add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.  </p><p>      But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.   </p><p>      And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to -- we were coming to you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I get a little bit tired -- I must say -- of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.   </p><p>      I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Sanders.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  We can stand up to them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Harris, your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.   </p><p>      Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  And let's talk about that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  That is a significant health care issue in America today.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.   </p><p>      Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Damn right we will. And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.  </p><p>      Furthermore -- and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight -- this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.   </p><p>      We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition fee and cancelling student debt, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders' plan to guaranteeing them a job?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job?  </p><p>      The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.   </p><p>      Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.   </p><p>      Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month, are those the best solutions there? Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I'm happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great -- as a great New Jersian, Yogi Berra, said, \"I am having deja vu all over again.\"   </p><p>      I'm having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And men...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  It is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It's because women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.   </p><p>      Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, \"a good story, except it's not really true.\" So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.   </p><p>      I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?   </p><p>      We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We need to restructure strength in this economy, and that's where it starts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>      Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.  </p><p>      But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.  </p><p>      I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They're putting hundreds of people to work at decent-paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.  </p><p>      On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  ... universal childcare, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 percent of their income for it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, I just need -- I just need to address this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Go ahead, Mr. Yang.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.   </p><p>      What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.   </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX every single day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, respond, please.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.   </p><p>      That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I see this as an important question about just -- I want to understand the data on this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  And I want to make sure we're responding to make this work.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Your time is up.  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.   </p><p>      And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.   </p><p>      This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.   </p><p>      Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.   </p><p>      We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.   </p><p>      We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.   </p><p>      But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.  </p><p>      So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.  </p><p>      What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.   </p><p>      If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.   </p><p>      They don't want a handout. They don't want a job guarantee. They just want a shot. And as president, I will give them that shot.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, \"Billionaires should not exist.\" Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people -- 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.   </p><p>      And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. And we cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.   </p><p>      So if you're asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying -- the wealthiest, top 0.1 percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that's exactly what I believe.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What's your plan for closing the income gap?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.   </p><p>      I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.   </p><p>      As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get $11 bucks. It's $7.25. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20 bucks.   </p><p>      There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president, because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants -- health care, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  ... unless we break the power of these corporations.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren's wealth tax plans do that?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  No, look, demonizing wealth -- what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea -- we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5 percent.   </p><p>      I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.   </p><p>      Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.   </p><p>      Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to -- we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.   </p><p>      And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees, they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  See, I'm doing the same thing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Senator Warren, your response.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we'll know what your values are.   </p><p>      And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth -- understand this -- that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... and cancel -- no, let me finish, please, and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  No one is supporting billionaires.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Mayor Buttigieg? Mayor Buttigieg, your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.   </p><p>      Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.  </p><p>      But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things. We're paying attention...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  ... to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing...   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  This is what it's going to take to get something done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Will a wealth tax -- will a wealth tax work?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.   </p><p>      So we have different ways -- I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  It is not one idea that rules here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.   </p><p>      Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I would like to respond to that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar, respond, please.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher, she wouldn't have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.   </p><p>      So just because we have different ideas, and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Well, here's how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.   </p><p>      And when I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.   </p><p>      So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.   </p><p>      That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I get elected and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that's going to make a real difference in that man's life. And don't tell him that's not a big deal...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  ... when he's trying to get through to the end of the month.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.   </p><p>      If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I think it's part of the solution. But I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.  </p><p>      I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.   </p><p>      And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman.  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  Erin, let me say...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive. Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.   </p><p>      And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's what this is about.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Castro, your response?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  There's no argument there. I just want to make sure that we're lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit or child tax credit...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  But that is...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... which we will do in my administration.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Go ahead, Senator.  </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX Go ahead, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country, early educational opportunities for every child, universal pre-K no matter where you live for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Raising the wages -- no, raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden that is crushing...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... I just want to know if working families are going to see a tax increase.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to get Secretary Castro in here, please, Congressman. Go ahead, Secretary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience.   </p><p>      I grew up like I bet a lot folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother. And we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off.   </p><p>      And when I was a kid, to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter, and that's what's happening to a lot of families these days. I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.  </p><p>      We can do better than that. I believe that wealth and equality tax, as I've proposed, is part of the answer, but also I've proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Secretary.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  ... and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right. Senator Booker, please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I just want to be respond by -- you know, we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. And how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters.   </p><p>      I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      It didn't work in 2016, and it will be a disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there. But we've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.   </p><p>      We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.   </p><p>      My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we're against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Booker.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  We've got to take a quick break. We've got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio will be right back after this.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.   </p><p>      I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's long-time Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now evaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and Russia, and Iran.   </p><p>      Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process. So would you send American troops back into northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in, they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.   </p><p>      It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history -- excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I've never seen a time -- and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what's happening here.   </p><p>      What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he's going to have a problem -- because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in northern Syria?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being -- having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congresswoman Gabbard, last week you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.   </p><p>      Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.   </p><p>      Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.   </p><p>      As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things -- ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaida in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.   </p><p>      What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis. He has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.   </p><p>      I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you've been calling for an end to endless wars. What's your response on Syria?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.   </p><p>      Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.  </p><p>      Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed -- ashamed -- of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking, what the hell happened to American leadership?   </p><p>      And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Yeah, absolutely. So, really, what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al Qaida, HTS, al-Nusra and others, because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war? That's really what you're saying?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mayor Pete -- Mayor Buttigieg?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  No, you can embrace -- or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy, as you're doing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Will you end the regime change war, is the question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  What we are doing...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Allow him to respond. Please allow him to respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  What we are doing -- or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.   </p><p>      When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.   </p><p>      This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility has been tattered.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I'm sorry. Say that again?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.   </p><p>      The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people, in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, \"We're with you, we're standing with you.\" And then suddenly, one day after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.   </p><p>      Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States. In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  But this is really important, because what this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies, too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that -- with our competitors. And, for example a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president. It's just not the behavior of adversaries like Russia.   </p><p>      But our one-time allies, like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist.   </p><p>      And Turkey, which was an American ally. That's the point. We had leverage. But when we abandon the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is the disappearance of U.S. leadership...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  ... from the world stage.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  And that makes this entire world a more dangerous place.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar, should Turkey remain in NATO? Your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here. And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it.   </p><p>      And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this, because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast.   </p><p>      Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and gives them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern. It's not an isolated incident.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>      Senator Harris, given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies, what would you do as president to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  That's a great question, Anderson, because the commander-in-chief of the United States of America has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.   </p><p>      I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security and hot spots around the world.   </p><p>      What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS.   </p><p>      And let's be clear. What Donald Trump has done, because of that phone call with Erdogan, is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a \"get out of jail free\" card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four:  Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.   </p><p>      This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making. And it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making. And that's why dude got to go. And when I am commander-in-chief, we will stop this madness.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Secretary Castro, your response.   </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX Castro, your response.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Well, I mean, you asked the question of, how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is we got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again.   </p><p>      You know, I also want people to think -- the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria. And just to connect the dots for a second, if you're Kim Jong-un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program, when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran's nuclear weapons program, and now he's abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?   </p><p>      I would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure Syria to stop the aggression, and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Booker, the American intelligence community says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we're seeing right now in northern Syria. What specifically would you do as president to check Vladimir Putin's power on the world stage?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  So, first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no better -- no greater enemy than the United States of America. This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia.   </p><p>      And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.   </p><p>      Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he's now given them a foothold again.   </p><p>      This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home, at the same time he's increasing troop presence with the Saudis, while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.   </p><p>      This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. And as president of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Vice President?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I think I maybe -- it doesn't make me any better or worse, but maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that -- you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO -- he understands if he's out of NATO, he's in real trouble.  </p><p>      But the fact of the matter is, we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Think what's happened. The fact of the matter is, you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, \"I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don't believe our intelligence community.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  You're suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  No, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I know.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  But here -- look, but here's the deal. Think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he'll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is re-elected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under -- we will be in real trouble.   </p><p>      And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.   </p><p>      And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.   </p><p>      But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage, we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country, there aren't enough servicemembers as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.   </p><p>      And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of servicemembers to fight those battles there.   </p><p>      And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy and our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of 18-, and 19-, and 20-year-olds any more, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman.   </p><p>      Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners, has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.   </p><p>      Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.   </p><p>      So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we're going to do, but specifically climate, we're going to have to lead the world morally, we're going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially.   </p><p>      This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one in every single light.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.   </p><p>      We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We've tampered with other elections, you've tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.  </p><p>      But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors, these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.   </p><p>      We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress the nature of the questioning. As commander-in-chief, I will help pull us forward...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I want to respond to Mr. Yang.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  ... and that's going to be the responsibility of the next president.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I don't see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election.   </p><p>      This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing. Sorry.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our election. So to protect ourselves in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state. That is a bill that I need, and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening.   </p><p>      And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That's the Honest Ads Act. That's a bipartisan bill that I lead. And we can't wait...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  ... to become president to get that done. We need to get it done now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  We want to turn back to domestic issues and the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We're less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, in the last debate, you said, quote, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" but when you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.   </p><p>      Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.   </p><p>      So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging, with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.   </p><p>      Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them. More than 80 percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman...  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman, let me follow up. Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will fine people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the street. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you don't know where they are?   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, they will be other consequences from law enforcement.  </p><p>      But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, just yesterday, you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation and said that Congressman O'Rourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant. Your response on guns?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Look, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can't wait. People are dying in the streets right now.   </p><p>      We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman O'Rourke, your response.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis. We've got to do something about it.   </p><p>      And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war, but to use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, look, we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day.  </p><p>      No, let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we're going to achieve. And then let's bring this country together in order to do that. Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who, in fact, came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... that calls for mandatory buybacks, let's follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let's do what's right...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mayor Buttigieg, your response? Mayor Buttigieg?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  The problem isn't the polls. The problems is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.   </p><p>      The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  That's a mischaracterization. Anderson, I've got to answer this. Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who've lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47, marched for our lives, formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians, that was a slap in the fact to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  We must buy them back.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. I'm glad you offered up that analogy to health care, because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire adult life.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  No, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we're going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it's \"hell, yes, we're going to take your guns\"? We have an opportunity...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor. Your time is up.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  ... to deliver health care to everybody, and some on this stage are saying it doesn't count unless we obliterate...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  I want to give somebody -- I want to give other -- I want to give other candidates a chance. Senator Booker, what's your response to Mayor Buttigieg?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, look, I again, worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown. There was a young man in my neighborhood, I watched him grow up. I lived in some high-rise projects with him named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle.   </p><p>      I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day.   </p><p>      And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership. This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I'm not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage.   </p><p>      But it's frustrating that when the American people, 77 percent of Americans agree on licensing, we don't need leadership right now. We just need folks that are going to stand up and follow where the people already are, because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where we're surrendering our freedoms...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  ... to fear in this country. This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the Planet Earth, and said to them, \"We can't protect you\"...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  ... \"so in school, we're going to teach you how to hide.\" There are more duck-and-cover drills and shelter-in-place drills in America now than fire drills.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  If I'm president of the United States, I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure that we end the scourge of mass violence in our country.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren -- Senator Warren supports a voluntary -- excuse me, Senator Klobuchar, you support a voluntary buyback, if I'm correct, right. What is wrong with a mandatory buyback? Your response.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I'm looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting, 30 seconds, nine people killed.   </p><p>      The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell's desk, the background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don't get guns, the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That's what we should be focusing on.   </p><p>      And I just don't want to screw this up. When I'm president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again. But let's not mess this up with this fight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault-style weapons, as well. Why not a mandatory one?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, look, I want to get what works done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them, and a huge tax on them, and then let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people.   </p><p>      But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you've rightly identified, it's not just about mass shootings. It's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide, and it is about domestic violence.   </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX about domestic violence.   </p><p>      This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we're done. We have to reduce gun violence overall. And the question we have to ask is, why hasn't it happened?   </p><p>      You say we're so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation and it didn't pass because of the filibuster.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibuster or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Harris? Senator Harris, you disagree with Senator Warren. You think the buyback should be mandatory. Please respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons total.   </p><p>      This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I'm done. And we need action.   </p><p>      And Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I'm elected, I'll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature, and if they don't, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Biden -- Vice President Biden, your response.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I'm the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred.   </p><p>      The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street -- or not on the street, that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.   </p><p>      I'm the only one that got -- got -- moved the -- to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That would change it.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>      Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from handguns, not assault-style weapons. What's your plan to prevent those deaths?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.   </p><p>      You know, in the neighborhoods -- let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory.   </p><p>      But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn't even announced himself. And within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home.   </p><p>      And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Secretary Castro, thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic, Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Brie, a teacher in Proctorville, asks, in rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily, witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember, when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.   </p><p>      As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the e-mail from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \"Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.\"   </p><p>      So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.  </p><p>      And you can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help rural areas where they're so isolated, and also in urban areas, where it's, by the way, not just opiates. There are still mental health issues and crack cocaine issues.   </p><p>      This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And by his third DWI, they said to him, the prosecutor, you've got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's 91 and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here, anyway. But he still has an AA group that visits him there.   </p><p>      And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had, 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that's not only a tragedy for them, it's a tragedy for their family and their communities.  </p><p>      And so I think we have to treat this as a health citizens. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.  </p><p>      But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government. And we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.   </p><p>      We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a natural referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote  </p><p>      These corporations have taken over our government. And 72,000 deaths...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  ... last year are the tragic result.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  That's exactly right. And we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.  </p><p>      They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2 percent fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.  </p><p>      So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our community so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem.   </p><p>      And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is, after you save someone who's OD'ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.   </p><p>      So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.   </p><p>      I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the V.A. Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribe an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the V.A....  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  Yes, preach, Beto.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who've been arrested for possession, and make sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.  </p><p>      I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  They're an opportunity for our public health system in America.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman. Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  I am. And I will tell you, as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do.   </p><p>      The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.   </p><p>      And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And, yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.   </p><p>      And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice, understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs, and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. We're moving on, Senator. I'm sorry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I'm healthy. I'm feeling great, but I would like to respond to that question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to -- I want start by saying...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear, as well.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I do. I'm not on it tonight.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  This debate -- this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Go ahead and finish your point and then I'll ask my question, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I'm more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let's take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic.   </p><p>      You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.   </p><p>      This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  That is why we need a political revolution...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  ... that says enough is enough to this behavior.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  ... as you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight. You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event. And we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.   </p><p>      But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged.   </p><p>      Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.   </p><p>      It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there, and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression.   </p><p>      I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Before the first vote.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Before Iowa?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Not by the end of this year?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I've released them before. I released 55 pages of my -- I'm the only guy that's released anything up here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Look, the way I see this, the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.   </p><p>      And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong.   </p><p>      If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives, things like childcare and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren.   </p><p>      Congresswoman Gabbard, you're 38 years old, and you would be the youngest president if elected. Should age matter when choosing a president?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I'm glad you asked, because I was going to say it's not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape.  </p><p>      But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like. It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.  </p><p>      Bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.   </p><p>      I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congresswoman.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  I'd like to ask our other candidates this question. I'd like to start with Senator Warren...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  ... what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I'm sorry, thank you. We're going to take another break now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio will be back in just a few moments.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX a few moments.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.   </p><p>      But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.   </p><p>      So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.   </p><p>      Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place:  that's Amazon.   </p><p>      It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      Mr. Steyer, your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.   </p><p>      But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.   </p><p>      In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.   </p><p>      Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.   </p><p>      And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.   </p><p>      And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.   </p><p>      Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.   </p><p>      And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.   </p><p>      So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>      Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.   </p><p>      But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.   </p><p>      And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.  </p><p>      Because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.   </p><p>      We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  No?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.   </p><p>      You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... that support us all.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  I'm not finished. I'm not finished.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.   </p><p>      And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.   </p><p>      But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  And this means everything from tech on down.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Please respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.   </p><p>      And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LACEY</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Yang.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  There's a bigger issue here...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.  </p><p>      Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.   </p><p>      The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Harris, thank you.   </p><p>      Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.   </p><p>      That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you.   </p><p>      Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.   </p><p>      And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.   </p><p>      I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p>      Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.   </p><p>      I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.   </p><p>      I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you very much.   </p><p>      The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.   </p><p>      Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.   </p><p>      I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.   </p><p>      The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.   </p><p>      And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.   </p><p>      And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>      Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.   </p><p>      What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.   </p><p>      Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.   </p><p>      There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  ... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.   </p><p>      I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.   </p><p>      But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.   </p><p>      What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Thank you very much, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.   </p><p>      Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.   </p><p>      I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.   </p><p>      And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?  </p><p>      MORE  </p><p>      XXX is being vague?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  You'll both get in.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Two things. Let me explain in two ways.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.   </p><p>      Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  No.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  We can.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  No, you can't.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  And we can afford to do it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  By the way, the greed and...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Let him respond. Mr. Vice President?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance, and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, your response?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed.   </p><p>      And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated.   </p><p>      I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  ... for the things that touch people's lives.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mayor...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I agree. Let me -- she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight, too.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, do you want to respond?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  You did a hell of a job in your job.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I said, no, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  Not me.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mayor Buttigieg, which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump? That's the essential question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.   </p><p>      We're being offered a false choice. I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration. I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal. Because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.   </p><p>      But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.   </p><p>      Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further, free college for low- and middle-income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we've done...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  ... in my lifetime...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  I did not say back to normal.   </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mayor. Senator Klobuchar? Senator Klobuchar?  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  Thank you. You know, this isn't a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're bold.   </p><p>      But we can't get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win. And what I have done is win and the only one up here, time and time again, the reddest of red districts, Michele Bachmann's, I -- I won that district three times, rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable.   </p><p>      And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and all over Ohio and in Iowa, because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you. Senator Warren, she referenced you, so you can respond.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Now, people who are struggling to pay health care are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today.   </p><p>      And anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who is likely to win them. For me, this is about knowing what's broken, knowing how to fix it, and, yes, I'm willing to get out there and fight for it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  There's a missing people, and that is...  </p><p>      (CROSSTALK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, why is your approach more likely to beat President Trump?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  I'll tell you why.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Please respond.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  And here's the radical reason why. It's what the American people want.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  All right, the American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71 percent of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we've got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren.   </p><p>      The way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old. You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You've got to bring working people and young people and poor people into the political process...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  ... because they know you stand for them, not corporate America.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman O'Rourke, is political revolution what the American people want? Your response.   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress, I found that El Paso, Texas, had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental health care provider at the V.A. I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I serve.   </p><p>      So we set about turning around the V.A., hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country. And we were able to do that, and we took what we learned, and we applied it to a national law as a member of the minority working with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand mental health care access for veterans nationally.   </p><p>      And then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congressman.   </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  ... talking about this progressive agenda, and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won, that's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congressman O'Rourke, thank you. We have to take a quick break. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Ohio will continue right after this.  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  We are back with the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on.   </p><p>      Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.   </p><p>      So in that spirit, we'd like you to tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us and what impact it's had on you and your beliefs.   </p><p>      Secretary Castro, let's begin with you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CASTRO</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, thank you to Marc, thank you, Anderson, and thank you, Erin, and CNN, and New York Times and everybody who is here tonight.   </p><p>      You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me, or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.   </p><p>      And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.   </p><p>      I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.   </p><p>      I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.  </p><p>      And there are people, whether it's our former president, George W. Bush, or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Congresswoman Gabbard?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GABBARD</emphasis>:  Thank you. You know, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with \"aloha.\" It's not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we're all connected, we're all brothers and sisters, we're all God's children.   </p><p>      So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially, with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We've developed a friendship that's based on respect. And he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.   </p><p>      The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.   </p><p>      When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.   </p><p>      So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Congresswoman.  </p><p>      Senator Klobuchar?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KLOBUCHAR</emphasis>:  For me, it's John McCain, and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.\"   </p><p>      And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this:  \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"   </p><p>      That's what we're doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win -- and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate -- is by winning big.   </p><p>      And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that's out there today, but it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this. And I ask you to join me because I've done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator, thank you very much.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEYER</emphasis>:  So I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She's a different gender. She's a different race. She's from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.   </p><p>      My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York Public Schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.   </p><p>      And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.   </p><p>      I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Congressman O'Rourke?  </p><p>      O'ROURKE:  I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges, regardless of the differences. I did that as a small-business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.   </p><p>      Did it as a member of the City Council, where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.   </p><p>      As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the V.A. there, March of 2017. Found that my flight had been snowed in, in Washington, D.C. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim, I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?   </p><p>      And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1,600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.   </p><p>      By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue.   </p><p>      And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat. We won independents and Republicans in record numbers, as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  Well, look, I have so many, I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship, even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle.   </p><p>      I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan, and he's a meat-eating Texan.   </p><p>      But I'll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test. The spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history. Rugged individualism didn't get us to the Moon. It didn't beat the Nazis. It didn't map the human genome. It didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big.  </p><p>      And, Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.   </p><p>      This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic of grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.   </p><p>      And love is not sentimentality. It's not anemic. Love is struggle. Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  ... our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BOOKER</emphasis>:  And if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator. Mr. Yang?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">YANG</emphasis>:  First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. And if you don't feel like you answered your -- you got your question answered tonight, it's understandable. There are 12 of us.   </p><p>      I'm going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My web site, yang2020.com. And if you ask your question tonight, there's a better chance I'll get to it.   </p><p>      My surprising friendship, it's been so much fun running for president, because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.   </p><p>      And I'm happy to say that, after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we remained in touch ever since.   </p><p>      The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party.   </p><p>      Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we're going to build a wall, we're going to turn the clock back, we're going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward. And that is where we must take the country in 2020.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mr. Yang, thank you very much. Senator Harris?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HARRIS</emphasis>:  Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I -- actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, \"Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this.\" And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.   </p><p>      And I guess that's why I'm running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country, we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.   </p><p>      And I'll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone. And she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer. And so she arrived in California. She got -- you know, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father, and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended.   </p><p>      But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney general of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, and I will tell you, that's part of why I'm running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideas will always hold true.   </p><p>      And so that's what is at stake in this election. And I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives.   </p><p>      When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other.   </p><p>      In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you can go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.   </p><p>      It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create. And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.   </p><p>      I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SANDERS</emphasis>:  When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history. And I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board.   </p><p>      And I worked with John McCain. I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration.   </p><p>      More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S. -- get the votes to get the U.S. troops out of that area.   </p><p>      But I think, at the end of day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion.   </p><p>      And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  You ask about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican.   </p><p>      And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was. But he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.   </p><p>      You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three elder brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we're divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together.   </p><p>      We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in.   </p><p>      Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.   </p><p>      People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more, we want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BIDEN</emphasis>:  This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.   </p><p>      The two people maybe would surprise you the most were -- he's been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.   </p><p>      And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.  </p><p>      And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.   </p><p>      Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.  </p><p>      And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake, get up. Get up and remember, there is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COOPER</emphasis>:  Candidates, thank you. That concludes the fourth Democratic presidential debate. We want to thank Otterbein University for hosting us. Now please stay tuned to CNN for special coverage of tonight's debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X91-KHB1-F15W-H385-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

We are in Ohio tonight, because it's one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896.</p><p>BURNETT:  The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate, so to accommodate the large group, there are no opening statements tonight.</p><p>LACEY:  Before we begin, a reminder of the ground rules. You'll each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates, as that will count against your time.</p><p>COOPER:  And we remind our audience here in the Rike Center at Otterbein to be respectful so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right, let's begin.</p><p>Since the last debate, House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump, which all the candidates on this stage support. Senator Warren, I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office. But the question is, with the election only one year away, why shouldn't it be the voters who determine the president's fate?</p><p>WARREN:  Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics. And I think that's the case with this impeachment inquiry.</p><p>When I made the decision to run for president, I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment. But when the Mueller report came out, I read it, all 442 pages. And when I got to the end, I realized that Mueller had shown, too, a fare-thee-well, that this president had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment, I called for opening an impeachment inquiry.</p><p>Now, that didn't happen. And look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know, we took a constitutional oath, and that is that no one is above the law, and that includes the president of the United States.</p><p>Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump, but, understand, it's about the next president and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator Warren. You're all going to get in on this, by the way. Senator Sanders, do Democrats have any chance but to impeach President Trump? Please respond.</p><p>SANDERS:  No, they don't. In my judgment, Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller Report. I think that the House will find him guilty of -- worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that, and that is outrageous.</p><p>And I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident, the idea that we have a president of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward, by the way, not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process, but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate.</p><p>COOPER:  Vice President Biden, during the Clinton impeachment proceedings, you said, and I quote, \"The American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton, and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision.\" With the country now split, have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump?</p><p>BIDEN:  Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice -- no choice -- but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.</p><p>This president -- and I agree with Bernie, Senator Sanders -- is the most corrupt president in modern history and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that, in fact, he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, it's just being observant, because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago, listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time.</p><p>During that election, Donald Trump told us he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently since he won been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people. He's been selling out our values. He's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.</p><p>Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president. And our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments. And so Congress must act.</p><p>But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long, because as a former prosecutor, I know a confession when I see it. And he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence. And he tried to cover it up, putting it in that special server. And there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's, quote, \"moral vandalism\" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER:  So, first of all, we must be fair. We are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and not partisanship.</p><p>Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel. But we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart.</p><p>Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bare before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs, in what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his. I will do mine.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator Booker.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, you have -- what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, health care, the economy, and could backfire on Democrats?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment, but we also can stand up for America, because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interests.</p><p>He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio. He's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion. He talked to him about that.</p><p>So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get him involved in interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter, where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again.</p><p>It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers' issues, whether it is farmers' issues, he has put his own private interests...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  ... and I will not do that.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction?</p><p>CASTRO:  Not at all. We can walk and chew gun at the same time. And all of us are out there every single day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross a graduation stage, that more families have great health care, that more folks are put to work in places like Ohio, where Donald Trump has broken his promises, because Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually in the latest jobs data have lost jobs, not gained them.</p><p>Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller Report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is in ongoingly -- in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power.</p><p>We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed.</p><p>COOPER:  Mayer Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There's been, obviously, very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans, who enable the president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share.</p><p>Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable, for not just the things emerging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything.</p><p>But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what it's actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president.</p><p>It starts out feeling like a happy thought; this particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. But really think about where we'll be:  vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process.</p><p>I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues that are going to be just as urgent then as they are now.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House member on this stage. How do you respond?</p><p>GABBARD:  If impeachment is driven by these hyperpartisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we're already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016.</p><p>The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And I think that it should continue to play its course out, to gather all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward.</p><p>If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support?</p><p>STEYER:  Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago, I started the Need to Impeach movement, because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They're the voice that counts, and that's who I went to, the American people.</p><p>COOPER:  Mr. Yang, do you think there's already enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond.</p><p>YANG:  I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016. We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state.</p><p>Why did Donald Trump win your state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns. And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands.</p><p>It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing 30 percent of America's stores and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth industrial revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office.</p><p>The fact is, Donald Trump, when we're talking about him, we are losing. We need to present a new vision, and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  You know, I think about everyone who's ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight in Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard, those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice.</p><p>And we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this president's criminality and his lawlessness. The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land, he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As president, he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation, then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics, as well as China, in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  If we do not hold him to account, if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment, our Constitution and our country, but we have failed everyone who has sacrificed and laid their lives down on the line.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  And we cannot do that.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.</p><p>Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president, no one in your family or associated with you will be involved in any foreign businesses. My question is, if it's not OK for a president's family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it OK for your son when you were vice president? Vice President Biden?</p><p>BIDEN:  Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the policy of the United States government in rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>And what I wanted to make a point about -- and my son's statement speaks for itself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.</p><p>On the -- look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections, it was the greatest threat to America. This president on three occasions -- three occasions -- has invited foreign governments and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections. The fact is that it is outrageous.</p><p>Rudy Giuliani, the president, and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate. He's going after me because he knows, if I get the nomination, I will beat him like a drum.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Anderson -- Anderson...</p><p>COOPER:  Hold on, sorry, just to follow up. Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today gave an interview, admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgement by serving on that board in Ukraine. Did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at the time. You can answer.</p><p>BIDEN:  Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son about anything having do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We've always kept everything separate. Even when my son was the attorney general of the state of Delaware, we never discussed anything, so there would be no potential conflict.</p><p>My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgement he made. I'm proud of what he had to say. And let's focus on this. The fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, your response?</p><p>SANDERS:  Let me make a point. I think that it is absolutely imperative we go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster, if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we're forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck. So what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way.</p><p>But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Mark?</p><p>LACEY:  We want to move now to the economy.</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX to the economy.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  May I get in, please?</p><p>LACEY:  You've proposed some sweeping plans...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACEY:  ... free public college...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It is wrong to move on.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. We're going to -- Senator Warren.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  It is wrong to move on.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Warren, we've proposed -- you've proposed some sweeping plans, free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans' college debt. And you've said how you're going to pay for those plans. But you have not specified how you're going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?</p><p>WARREN:  So I have made clear what my principles are here, and that is costs will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations, and for hard-working middle-class families, costs will go down. You know, the way I see this is, I have been out all around this country. I've done 140 town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico. Shoot, I've done 70,000 selfies, which must be the new measure of democracy.</p><p>And this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. So I have talked with the family, the mom and dad whose daughter's been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I've talked to the young man who has MS.</p><p>And here's the thing about all of them. They all had great health insurance right at the beginning. But then they found out when they really needed it, when the costs went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing.</p><p>Look, the way I see this, it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if your mom has diabetes, or what it means for your life going forward if you've been diagnosed with MS. But what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you're going to pay for your health care after that.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for all. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?</p><p>WARREN:  So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families.</p><p>LACEY:  Mayor Buttigieg, you say Senator Warren has been, quote, \"evasive\" about how she's going to pay for Medicare for all. What's your response?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and Capitol Hill in particular. Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this.</p><p>No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in. And the thing is, we really can deliver health care for every American and move forward with the boldest, biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself.</p><p>But the way to do it without a giant multi-trillion-dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes-or-no question is Medicare for all who want it. We take a version of Medicare. We let you access it if you want to. And if you prefer to stay on your private plan, you can do that, too. That is what most Americans want, Medicare for all who want it, trusting you to make the right decision for your health care and for your family. And it can be delivered without an increase on the middle-class taxes.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mayor. Senator, your response?</p><p>WARREN:  So, let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who want it, understand what that really means. It's Medicare for all who can afford it. And that's the problem we've got.</p><p>Medicare for all is the gold standard. It is the way we get health care coverage for every single American, including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who's just gotten an MS diagnosis. That's how we make sure that everyone gets health care.</p><p>We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.</p><p>I've been studying this, you know, for the biggest part of my life...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Can the -- can the...</p><p>WARREN:  ... why people go bankrupt.</p><p>LACEY:  ... mayor respond?</p><p>WARREN:  Sure.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice. And the choice of Medicare for all who want it, which is affordable for everyone, because we make sure that the subsidies are in place, allows you to get that health care. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not.</p><p>And I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans, kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years, when we could achieve that same big, bold goal -- and once again, we have a president -- we're competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now, after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there's a better way to deliver coverage for all?</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. Thank you, Mayor. Senator Sanders?</p><p>WARREN:  I'd like to be able to respond...</p><p>SANDERS:  Well, as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said, let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Co-payments are gone. Deductibles are gone. All out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do.</p><p>At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their health care bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less -- substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expansions.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, at least that's a straightforward answer, but there's a better way.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up?</p><p>WARREN:  So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hardworking, middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it that will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says, \"Sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS.\"</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar...</p><p>WARREN:  \"We're not covering what you need.\"</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice.</p><p>I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceutical companies. That is what we should be doing instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in our years.</p><p>And I'm tired of hearing, whenever I say these things, oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan that's going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold, that will cover more people, and it's the one we should get behind.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Warren?</p><p>WARREN:  You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hardworking people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of health care.</p><p>And back when I was studying it, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we've got right now is the overall cost of health care. And, look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I've put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part is that is we have got to stop...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  ... Americans from going bankrupt over health care costs.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But, again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done. And we can get this public option done. And we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices.</p><p>But what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times, is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. That is long-term care. We are seeing -- I once called it a silver tsunami. The aging -- and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge -- the aging of the population.</p><p>We need to make easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the state of Ohio, that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Vice President Biden...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARRIS:  I'd like to be...</p><p>LACEY:  Let me -- let me bring you in here, Vice President, for your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans?</p><p>BIDEN:  First of all, the plan we're hearing discussed is the Biden plan, the one I built forward. Build on Obamacare, add a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like.</p><p>But here's the deal. On the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget.</p><p>And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that, in fact, it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000, because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. If you're making -- if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making $100,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $10,000. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward that will work.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Sanders, do you want to respond to -- we were coming to you.</p><p>WARREN:  I get a little bit tired -- I must say -- of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason, they came down with cancer.</p><p>I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the health care industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt, price-fixing pharmaceutical industry, which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator Sanders.</p><p>BIDEN:  We can stand up to them.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Harris, your response?</p><p>HARRIS:  This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle and not nearly one word, with all of these discussions about health care, on women's access to reproductive health care, which is under full-on attack in America today.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die, poor women, women of color will die, because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies.</p><p>Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS:  And let's talk about that.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS:  That is a significant health care issue in America today.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to turn now to jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit.</p><p>Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, but tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans?</p><p>SANDERS:  Damn right we will. And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, et cetera.</p><p>Furthermore -- and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight -- this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.</p><p>We need workers to do childcare. We need workers, great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition fee and cancelling student debt, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders' plan to guaranteeing them a job?</p><p>YANG:  I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job?</p><p>The fact is, most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.</p><p>Also, Senator Sanders, the description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife, who's at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. We have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month. It actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities. It helps all Americans transition.</p><p>Because the fact is -- and you know this in Ohio -- if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources, you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants. When we put the money into our hands, we can build a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the fourth industrial revolution that we have to embrace as a party.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month, are those the best solutions there? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, first of all, I'm happy to get in finally. And I just want to say, as a great -- as a great New Jersian, Yogi Berra, said, \"I am having deja vu all over again.\"</p><p>I'm having deja vu all over again, first of all, because I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies. And the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That was so offensive. He should not have to defend ourselves. And the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we're distracting from his malfeasance and selling out of his office.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'm having deja vu all over again. And I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another health care debate, and we're not talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthoods close. We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala, but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And men...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER:  It is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives. It's because women are people. And people deserve to control their own bodies.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight.</p><p>Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is, quote, \"a good story, except it's not really true.\" So should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?</p><p>WARREN:  So the data show that we have had a lot of problems with losing jobs, but the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who've been calling the shots on trade, giant multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.</p><p>I have a plan to fix that, and it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America? Then, by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides, gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico, when there are people on the board in the boardroom saying, no, do you know what that does to our company, do you know what that does to our community, to what it does to our workers?</p><p>We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to restructure strength in this economy, and that's where it starts.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?</p><p>CASTRO:  Well, I think -- I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? You know, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I'm even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work.</p><p>But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country. As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio, in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy.</p><p>I was in Newton, Iowa, a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa, had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility, and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They're putting hundreds of people to work at decent-paying jobs and creating a better future for those families.</p><p>On top of that, let me just say this. We need to support working families. We need to invest in things like...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO:  ... universal childcare, so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 percent of their income for it.</p><p>YANG:  Senator Warren, I just need -- I just need to address this.</p><p>BURNETT:  Go ahead, Mr. Yang.</p><p>YANG:  Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation. And they're smart. They see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonalds, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states, including this one; 3.5 million truck drivers in this country. And my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks.</p><p>What is that going to mean for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million Americans who work in truck stops, motels, and diners that rely upon the truckers getting out and having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day.</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX every single day.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Warren, respond, please.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So I understand that what we're all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class. And actually, I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. It's one of the reasons that I've put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now.</p><p>That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty. And it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors, and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  So after a lifetime of hard work, people are entitled to retire with dignity.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  I see this as an important question about just -- I want to understand the data on this.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>WARREN:  And I want to make sure we're responding to make this work.</p><p>BURNETT:  Your time is up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond.</p><p>GABBARD:  Thank you. You know, really what this is about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well founded. As people look to this automation revolution, they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives.</p><p>And I agree with my friend, Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see.</p><p>This has to do with bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interests of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is intrinsic to who we all are as Americans, whatever we choose to do with our lives, and we can't forget that.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you very much.</p><p>LACEY:  One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio. Now it's 72nd. Today, thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers.</p><p>Senator Booker, one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As president, how would you convince GM to return production to the United States?</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, first of all, the one point I wanted to make about the UBI conversation -- and I hope that my friend, Andrew Yang, will come out for this -- doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1,000 a month.</p><p>We have to start putting the dignity back in work. And, number one, you start having trade deals, not like this thing that the president is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal.</p><p>We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country, but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed.</p><p>But it's more than that. I stood with these workers because we're seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with unions because, right now, unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down, we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country.</p><p>So the other thing that I'll do as president of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers' conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I've met with these members of the UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio, which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance, paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure around there.</p><p>What they want is a shot. And they want fairness in how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage.</p><p>If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K through 12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country, and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot.</p><p>They don't want a handout. They don't want a job guarantee. They just want a shot. And as president, I will give them that shot.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>BURNETT:  Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you, Senator, \"Billionaires should not exist.\" Is the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence?</p><p>WARREN:  When you have a half-a-million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people -- 87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you've got hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college, and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt, and then you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage.</p><p>And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality. And we cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.</p><p>So if you're asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying -- the wealthiest, top 0.1 percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create a nation and a government that works for all of us? Yes, that's exactly what I believe.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What's your plan for closing the income gap?</p><p>STEYER:  Well, first of all, let me say this. Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government, and those 40 years have meant a 40-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. It's absolutely wrong. It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.</p><p>I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.</p><p>As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organized labor, people haven't had a raise -- 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted it for inflation, you get $11 bucks. It's $7.25. If you included the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20 bucks.</p><p>There's something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president, because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants -- health care, education, Green New Deal, or a living wage...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>STEYER:  ... unless we break the power of these corporations.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warren's wealth tax plans do that?</p><p>BIDEN:  No, look, demonizing wealth -- what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea -- we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax -- I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate, of 39.5 percent.</p><p>I would double it, because guess what? Why in God's name should someone who's clipping coupons in the stock market make -- in fact, pay a lower tax rate than someone who, in fact, is -- like I said -- the -- a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous. And they pay a lower tax.</p><p>Secondly, the idea that we, in fact, engage in this notion that there are -- there's $1,640,000,000,000 in tax loopholes. You can't justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had I the time.</p><p>Secondly -- I mean, thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to -- we are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.</p><p>And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything into every answer that is given. The fact is, everybody's right about the fact that the fourth industrial revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in our employees, they're reinvesting and buying back their stock.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>BIDEN:  See, I'm doing the same thing.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Senator Warren, your response.</p><p>WARREN:  So I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plans, and we'll know what your values are.</p><p>And right now in America, the top 0.1 percent have so much wealth -- understand this -- that if we put a 2 cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar, and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country, age zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition-free college, put $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  ... and cancel -- no, let me finish, please, and cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it does everyone else on this stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>BIDEN:  No one is supporting billionaires.</p><p>BURNETT:  Mayor Buttigieg? Mayor Buttigieg, your response?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live.</p><p>Washington politicians, congressmen and senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad's Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school, I didn't know that wasn't every city until I went away to college. Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers.</p><p>But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. And while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things. We're paying attention...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mayor. Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  ... to who sounded better on a debate stage or in a committee hearing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  This is what it's going to take to get something done.</p><p>BURNETT:  Will a wealth tax -- will a wealth tax work?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that after that tax bill passed went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said, guess what, you guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth.</p><p>So we have different ways -- I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects that dignity of work, makes sure we have decent retirement, and makes sure that our kids can go to good schools.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you. Senator...</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  It is not one idea that rules here.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Klobuchar. Senator Warren, please respond.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So understand, taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation.</p><p>Look, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I would like to respond to that.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Klobuchar, respond, please.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  You know, I think simply because you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines, he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher, she wouldn't have been able to make the wages she made when my parents got divorced.</p><p>So just because we have different ideas, and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on, we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency, but only if we unite, if we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year to help close the income gap.</p><p>HARRIS:  Right.</p><p>BURNETT:  Is that a better solution than a wealth tax?</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, here's how I think about it. When I was growing up, my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner, and at some point we'd go to bed, and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.</p><p>And when I think about where we are right now in 2020, I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice, and so many other issues.</p><p>So when I think about this issue, I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table, after everyone's gone to sleep, and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee trying to figure out how it's going to make -- how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month, he's going to have to start driving an Uber. And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs, he's going to miss his kids' soccer games.</p><p>That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I get elected and pass this bill, which will give the American family who makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year that they can take home at up to $500 a month, that's going to make a real difference in that man's life. And don't tell him that's not a big deal...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>HARRIS:  ... when he's trying to get through to the end of the month.</p><p>BURNETT:  Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?</p><p>YANG:  Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner-take-all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principle. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden, and all those countries ended up repealing it, because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they'd projected.</p><p>If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries, what can we learn from? We should not be looking to other countries' mistakes. Instead, we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark, and Sweden still have, which is a value-added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad, we can generate hundreds of billions of dollars and then put it into our hands, because we know best how to use it.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality? Your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I think it's part of the solution. But I think we need to be focused on lifting people up. And sometimes I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive and pitting some part of the country against the other instead of lifting people up and making sure that this country comes together around those solutions.</p><p>I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities, and any American with disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it and get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations, she wants to know how we are going to help her, how we're going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs, that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities, that she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.</p><p>And Senator Warren said show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person I met would see a tax increase. Under my administration, if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family, you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to know that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  Erin, let me say...</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.</p><p>WARREN:  So I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive. Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America. I guarantee you built it in part using workers all of us helped pay to educate. You built it in part getting your goods to markets on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us help pay the salaries for.</p><p>And all I'm saying is, you make it to the top, the top 0.1 percent, then pitch in two cents so every other kid in America has a chance to make it.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  That's what this is about.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Castro, your response?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  There's no argument there. I just want to make sure that we're lifting up those families who are working and need help through an expanded earned income tax credit or child tax credit...</p><p>WARREN:  But that is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... which we will do in my administration.</p><p>BURNETT:  Go ahead, Senator.</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX Go ahead, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country, early educational opportunities for every child, universal pre-K no matter where you live for every 3-year-old and 4-year-old.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  But in addition to that, will they see a tax increase?</p><p>WARREN:  Raising the wages -- no, raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investment in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of the student loan debt burden that is crushing...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... I just want to know if working families are going to see a tax increase.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to get Secretary Castro in here, please, Congressman. Go ahead, Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO:  Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans. And let me just say that the way that I view this is born out of my own experience.</p><p>I grew up like I bet a lot folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother, Joaquin, in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother. And we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off.</p><p>And when I was a kid, to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter, and that's what's happening to a lot of families these days. I was in Las Vegas a few months ago, and I visited people who were homeless, who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations.</p><p>We can do better than that. I believe that wealth and equality tax, as I've proposed, is part of the answer, but also I've proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Secretary.</p><p>CASTRO:  ... and investing in things like universal childcare and affordable housing.</p><p>BURNETT:  All right. Senator Booker, please respond.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, first of all, I just want to be respond by -- you know, we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one-term president. And how we talk about each other in this debate actually really matters.</p><p>I've had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage, and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It didn't work in 2016, and it will be a disaster for us in 2020. And so I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren. I have a different plan than many people on this stage. And it involves, again, fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there. But we've had 20 years of presidential debates, and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty.</p><p>We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top, but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world.</p><p>My plan will focus on that, and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not defining ourselves just by what we're against, but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Booker.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  We've got to take a quick break. We've got to take a quick break right now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University in Ohio will be right back after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.</p><p>I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's long-time Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now evaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government in Damascus, a victory for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and Russia, and Iran.</p><p>Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process. So would you send American troops back into northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies?</p><p>BIDEN:  I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops who are in Iraq, which are in retreat now, being fired on by Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying, if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons they're in, they'll only go to Europe and won't affect us.</p><p>It has been the most shameful thing that any president has done in modern history -- excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is, I've never seen a time -- and I've spent thousands of hours in the Situation Room, I've spent many hours on the ground in those very places, in Syria and in Iraq, and guess what? Our commanders across the board, former and present, are ashamed of what's happening here.</p><p>What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that, in fact, where he's going to have a problem -- because Turkey is the real problem here. And I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done now. Pay that price.</p><p>COOPER:  Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in northern Syria?</p><p>BIDEN:  I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being -- having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected, and work my way back toward what, in fact, needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful, shameful what this man has done.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman Gabbard, last week you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now?</p><p>GABBARD:  Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we've been waging in Syria.</p><p>Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011, along with many in the mainstream media, who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.</p><p>Not only that, but the New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable.</p><p>As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things -- ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern-day siege the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen, that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like Al Qaida in Syria who have been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>GABBARD:  I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me in calling for an end to this regime change war in Syria, finally.</p><p>WARREN:  So, look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. But we have to do it the right way, the smart way.</p><p>What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger-than-ever humanitarian crisis. He has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life.</p><p>I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I talk with our military leaders about this.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  I was in Iraq and went through the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  We need to get out, but we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no military solution in this region.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator. Mayor Buttigieg, Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you've been calling for an end to endless wars. What's your response on Syria?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values.</p><p>Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized, special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS.</p><p>Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that for the first time they feel ashamed -- ashamed -- of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking, what the hell happened to American leadership?</p><p>And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping me safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies knew it.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?</p><p>GABBARD:  Yeah, absolutely. So, really, what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security, you would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms in support to terrorist groups in Syria, like Al Qaida, HTS, al-Nusra and others, because they are the ones who have been the ground force in this regime change war? That's really what you're saying?</p><p>COOPER:  Mayor Pete -- Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, you can embrace -- or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policy, as you're doing.</p><p>GABBARD:  Will you end the regime change war, is the question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  What we are doing...</p><p>GABBARD:  What is an endless war if it's not a regime change war?</p><p>COOPER:  Allow him to respond. Please allow him to respond.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  What we are doing -- or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up, too.</p><p>When I was deployed, not just the Afghan National Army forces, but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next.</p><p>This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility has been tattered.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I will restore U.S. credibility before it is finally too late.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?</p><p>SANDERS:  I'm sorry. Say that again?</p><p>COOPER:  Is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO?</p><p>SANDERS:  No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter.</p><p>The crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people, in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said, \"We're with you, we're standing with you.\" And then suddenly, one day after a phone call with Erdogan, announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy.</p><p>Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States. In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy, because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  But this is really important, because what this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies, too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that -- with our competitors. And, for example a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president. It's just not the behavior of adversaries like Russia.</p><p>But our one-time allies, like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist.</p><p>And Turkey, which was an American ally. That's the point. We had leverage. But when we abandon the international stage, when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation, the consequence is the disappearance of U.S. leadership...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  ... from the world stage.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  And that makes this entire world a more dangerous place.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Klobuchar, should Turkey remain in NATO? Your response?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  We need to work with our allies, to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here. And I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the horror of what happened here with Turkey, but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it.</p><p>And what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid, but then we work with our allies to say come back, Turkey, and stop this, because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. Think about our other allies, Israel. How do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Mideast.</p><p>Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and gives them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern. It's not an isolated incident.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies, what would you do as president to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted?</p><p>HARRIS:  That's a great question, Anderson, because the commander-in-chief of the United States of America has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland.</p><p>I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time received classified information about the threats to our security and hot spots around the world.</p><p>What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out. And in this case, he sold out the Kurds, who, yes, fought with us and thousands died in our fight against ISIS.</p><p>And let's be clear. What Donald Trump has done, because of that phone call with Erdogan, is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a \"get out of jail free\" card. And you know who the winner is in this? There are four:  Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS.</p><p>This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making. And it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making. And that's why dude got to go. And when I am commander-in-chief, we will stop this madness.</p><p>COOPER:  Secretary Castro, your response.</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX Castro, your response.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>CASTRO:  Well, I mean, you asked the question of, how are we going to get people to trust us again? The first thing is we got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again.</p><p>You know, I also want people to think -- the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners running free to think about how absurd it is that this president is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria. And just to connect the dots for a second, if you're Kim Jong-un, for instance, why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program, when he tore up an Iran nuclear agreement that we just signed four years ago, which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran's nuclear weapons program, and now he's abandoned the very people that we gave our word to?</p><p>I would make sure that we work with our allies to pressure Syria to stop the aggression, and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Booker, the American intelligence community says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we're seeing right now in northern Syria. What specifically would you do as president to check Vladimir Putin's power on the world stage?</p><p>BOOKER:  So, first of all, understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage, the United States of America, there can be no better friend than the United States of America and no better -- no greater enemy than the United States of America. This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia.</p><p>And so clearly, to your question, number one, we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine, and Latvia, and Lithuania, but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable.</p><p>Russia and Putin understand strength, and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS, he's now given them a foothold again.</p><p>This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he's bringing our troops home, at the same time he's increasing troop presence with the Saudis, while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing tens of thousands of children in Yemen.</p><p>This president is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron. And as president of the United States, I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Vice President?</p><p>BIDEN:  I think I maybe -- it doesn't make me any better or worse, but maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin, as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that -- you talk about should he stay in or out of NATO -- he understands if he's out of NATO, he's in real trouble.</p><p>But the fact of the matter is, we have been unwilling in this administration, because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy and operates out of fear for his own re-election.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Think what's happened. The fact of the matter is, you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the president do? He says, \"I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don't believe our intelligence community.\"</p><p>SANDERS:  You're suggesting I'm Vladimir Putin here.</p><p>BIDEN:  No, no, I'm not. No, I'm not. I'm not.</p><p>SANDERS:  I know.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIDEN:  But here -- look, but here's the deal. Think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he'll keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is re-elected, I promise you, there will be no NATO. Our security will be vastly underrated, under -- we will be in real trouble.</p><p>And with regard to regime change in Syria, that has not been the policy we change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the Iraqi border.</p><p>And lastly, and I apologize for going on, but lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to -- I mean, excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria, we have ISIS that's going to come here. They are going to, in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions, even in the face of possible retaliation?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy and being able to do it thanks to Donald Trump functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now as we speak, still at the invitation of this president. So if there are not consequences, we will continue to see this problem going forward.</p><p>But in addition, y ademas, to answer the previous question that you asked, how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage, we do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships. That is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country, there aren't enough servicemembers as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world.</p><p>And the Kurds are case in point. In fact, because we turned our backs on them, those Kurds who fought for us in Syria, helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves, but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we will have to send another generation of servicemembers to fight those battles there.</p><p>And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier, has said, we have two powers, one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy and our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals not on the backs of 18-, and 19-, and 20-year-olds any more, but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Congressman. Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts? Please respond.</p><p>STEYER:  Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America first program, which involves having no plans, having no process, and having no partners, has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it's proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy, and more than that, when we look at the problems around the world, the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against a country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense.</p><p>Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing, which no one has brought up, which is climate. We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for 10 years, taking on the corporations. But we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.</p><p>So if you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem that we're going to do, but specifically climate, we're going to have to lead the world morally, we're going to have to lead it technologically, financially, and commercially.</p><p>This is the proof that this kind of America first, go-it-alone, trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I have ever heard and I would change it on day one in every single light.</p><p>LACEY:  Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia.</p><p>YANG:  Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is, we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump, and he's now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy.</p><p>We have to let Russia know, look, we get it. We've tampered with other elections, you've tampered with our elections. And now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.</p><p>But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the 21st century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and non-state actors, these are the threats that are going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology.</p><p>We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress the nature of the questioning. As commander-in-chief, I will help pull us forward...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I want to respond to Mr. Yang.</p><p>YANG:  ... and that's going to be the responsibility of the next president.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I don't see a moral equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shot down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election.</p><p>This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing. Sorry.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our election. So to protect ourselves in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state. That is a bill that I need, and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening.</p><p>And then we need to stop the social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles, without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That's the Honest Ads Act. That's a bipartisan bill that I lead. And we can't wait...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  ... to become president to get that done. We need to get it done now.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>COOPER:  We want to turn back to domestic issues and the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We're less than 100 miles from Dayton, Ohio, where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15-style weapon with a high-capacity magazine.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, in the last debate, you said, quote, \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" but when you were asked how you'd enforce a mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15s and AK-47s.</p><p>Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. Nine people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed in under three minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.</p><p>So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging, with 16 million AR-15s and AK-47s out there, they are also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror.</p><p>Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision surveyed them. More than 80 percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants, inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman...</p><p>O'ROURKE:  So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law, the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now.</p><p>COOPER:  OK.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  We don't go door to door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun-owners, non-gun-owners alike to respect and follow the law.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman, let me follow up. Just to follow up, your expectations aside, your website says you will fine people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the street. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to give them up and you don't know where they are?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war, or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, they will be other consequences from law enforcement.</p><p>But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you. Mayor Buttigieg, just yesterday, you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation and said that Congressman O'Rourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant. Your response on guns?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Look, Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop the plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can't wait. People are dying in the streets right now.</p><p>We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street. We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman O'Rourke, your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  This is not a purity test. This is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis. We've got to do something about it.</p><p>And those challenges that you described are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing. I want to make sure we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we end the sale of these weapons of war, but to use the analogy of health care, it would be as though we said, look, we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day.</p><p>No, let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we're going to achieve. And then let's bring this country together in order to do that. Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who march for our lives, who, in fact, came up with this extraordinary bold peace plan...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... that calls for mandatory buybacks, let's follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let's do what's right...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Mayor Buttigieg, your response? Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  The problem isn't the polls. The problems is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal. Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this.</p><p>The problem is the National Rifle Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>O'ROURKE:  That's a mischaracterization. Anderson, I've got to answer this. Never took you or anyone else on who disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, described this policy as a shiny object, I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy, but to those who have survived gun violence, those who've lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47, marched for our lives, formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll-tested politicians, that was a slap in the fact to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  We must buy them back.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. I'm glad you offered up that analogy to health care, because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressmen and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire adult life.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  No, this is really important, OK? On guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we're going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it's \"hell, yes, we're going to take your guns\"? We have an opportunity...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor. Your time is up.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  ... to deliver health care to everybody, and some on this stage are saying it doesn't count unless we obliterate...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  I want to give somebody -- I want to give other -- I want to give other candidates a chance. Senator Booker, what's your response to Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, look, I again, worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown. There was a young man in my neighborhood, I watched him grow up. I lived in some high-rise projects with him named Shahad, and he was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle.</p><p>I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem, because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gun shots are real every single day.</p><p>And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership. This is why when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I'm not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage.</p><p>But it's frustrating that when the American people, 77 percent of Americans agree on licensing, we don't need leadership right now. We just need folks that are going to stand up and follow where the people already are, because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where we're surrendering our freedoms...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER:  ... to fear in this country. This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the Planet Earth, and said to them, \"We can't protect you\"...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BOOKER:  ... \"so in school, we're going to teach you how to hide.\" There are more duck-and-cover drills and shelter-in-place drills in America now than fire drills.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>BOOKER:  If I'm president of the United States, I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure that we end the scourge of mass violence in our country.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Klobuchar -- Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren -- Senator Warren supports a voluntary -- excuse me, Senator Klobuchar, you support a voluntary buyback, if I'm correct, right. What is wrong with a mandatory buyback? Your response.</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I'm looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting, 30 seconds, nine people killed.</p><p>The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell's desk, the background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don't get guns, the bill to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. That's what we should be focusing on.</p><p>And I just don't want to screw this up. When I'm president, I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazines so what happened in Dayton, Ohio, will never happen again. But let's not mess this up with this fight.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Warren, you support a voluntary gun buyback of assault-style weapons, as well. Why not a mandatory one?</p><p>WARREN:  So, look, I want to get what works done. I want to use the method we used, for example, with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them, and a huge tax on them, and then let people turn them in, and it got machine guns out of the hands of people.</p><p>But the problem here that we need to focus on is, first, how widespread gun violence is. As you've rightly identified, it's not just about mass shootings. It's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide, and it is about domestic violence.</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX about domestic violence.</p><p>This is not going to be a one and done, that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we're done. We have to reduce gun violence overall. And the question we have to ask is, why hasn't it happened?</p><p>You say we're so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  ... when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation and it didn't pass because of the filibuster.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator. Senator...</p><p>WARREN:  We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibuster or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Harris? Senator Harris, you disagree with Senator Warren. You think the buyback should be mandatory. Please respond.</p><p>HARRIS:  Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top other six reasons total.</p><p>This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. I'm done. And we need action.</p><p>And Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I'm elected, I'll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature, and if they don't, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Biden -- Vice President Biden, your response.</p><p>BIDEN:  I'm the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them, and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred.</p><p>The way to deal with those guns and those AR-15s and assault weapons that are on the street -- or not on the street, that people own, is to do what we did with the National Firearms Act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon. You must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially.</p><p>I'm the only one that got -- got -- moved the -- to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds in it. I've done this. I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done, go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. That would change it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from handguns, not assault-style weapons. What's your plan to prevent those deaths?</p><p>CASTRO:  Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And I can remember ducking into the back seat of a car when I was a freshman in high school, across the street from my school, my public school, because folks were shooting at each other.</p><p>You know, in the neighborhoods -- let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buybacks. Number one, folks can't define it. And if you're not going door to door, then it's not really mandatory.</p><p>But also, in the places that I grew up in, we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And you all saw a couple days ago what happened to Atatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth. A cop showed up at 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her nephew. He didn't even announced himself. And within four seconds, he shot her and killed her through her home window. She was in her own home.</p><p>And so I am not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities, because police violence is also gun violence, and we need to address that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Secretary Castro, thank you.</p><p>LACEY:  Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country, the opioid epidemic, Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio Democratic voters for their most pressing questions. Brie, a teacher in Proctorville, asks, in rural Ohio, the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily, witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general, but specifically what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should never have happened to begin with. I remember, when I was a prosecutor, these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse. And we now know why.</p><p>As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits, probably one of the most horrible things that I saw was the e-mail from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \"Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.\"</p><p>So my first answer to that question, and which is included in my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment, are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.</p><p>And you can, with a 2 cents per milligram tax, bring in the money, plus with the federal master settlement, to help rural areas where they're so isolated, and also in urban areas, where it's, by the way, not just opiates. There are still mental health issues and crack cocaine issues.</p><p>This is personal for me. My dad, he struggled with alcoholism his whole life. And by his third DWI, they said to him, the prosecutor, you've got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment, and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's 91 and in assisted living, and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here, anyway. But he still has an AA group that visits him there.</p><p>And so for me, I believe that everyone in this country, including the people in rural America, have that same right to be pursued by grace.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.</p><p>STEYER:  Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had, 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year, and that's not only a tragedy for them, it's a tragedy for their family and their communities.</p><p>And so I think we have to treat this as a health citizens. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.</p><p>But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government. And we have a broken government because corporations have bought it. And every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want.</p><p>We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes, including term limits, a natural referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically, and make it a lot easier to vote</p><p>These corporations have taken over our government. And 72,000 deaths...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>STEYER:  ... last year are the tragic result.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids, including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?</p><p>YANG:  That's exactly right. And we have to recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the state of Ohio than human beings in the state of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate.</p><p>They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money, until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2 percent fine, and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.</p><p>So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our community so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem.</p><p>And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell. They will be referred to treatment and counseling. I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire, and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again, because the fact is, after you save someone who's OD'ing, you just bring them back to their house and they OD again the following week.</p><p>So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing. This was a systemic government failing. And then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country, because they save lives.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yes, it is, for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also just from some personal experiences I've had as a member of Congress where constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly, at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions.</p><p>I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the V.A. Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribe an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, ensured the V.A....</p><p>YANG:  Yes, preach, Beto.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who've been arrested for possession, and make sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.</p><p>I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met, and anyone with drug addiction today, is not a problem for the criminal justice system.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  They're an opportunity for our public health system in America.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Congressman. Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail?</p><p>HARRIS:  I am. And I will tell you, as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability, because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was attorney general of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do.</p><p>The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic.</p><p>And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing false advertising. They knew what they were pushing in communities and states like Ohio, without any concern about the repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks. And, yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice.</p><p>And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice, understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal? Let's end mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs, and let's go after these pharmaceutical companies for what they've been doing to destroy our country and states like Ohio.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond.</p><p>CASTRO:  Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable, not only financially, but also with criminal penalties. And, you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade-and-a-half ago.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BURNETT:  Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you. We're moving on, Senator. I'm sorry.</p><p>SANDERS:  I'm healthy. I'm feeling great, but I would like to respond to that question.</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to -- I want start by saying...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BOOKER:  And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear, as well.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Sanders, this debate does mark your...</p><p>SANDERS:  I do. I'm not on it tonight.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT:  This debate -- this debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Go ahead and finish your point and then I'll ask my question, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS:  I'm more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Cory and others have said. Let's take a deep breath. Take a look at this opioid epidemic.</p><p>You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit.</p><p>This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now, the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world. And they continue to make huge profits.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator...</p><p>SANDERS:  That is why we need a political revolution...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS:  ... that says enough is enough to this behavior.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well...</p><p>SANDERS:  Thank you.</p><p>BURNETT:  ... as you just said. But there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight. You're 78 years old, and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency?</p><p>SANDERS:  Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York, berniesanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event. And we are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.</p><p>But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. And I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former President Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can?</p><p>BIDEN:  Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged.</p><p>Look, one of the reasons I'm running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders, from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track.</p><p>It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why I decided to run this time, because I know what has to be done. I've done it before. I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there, and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression.</p><p>I know what has to be done. I will not need any on-the-job training the day I take office. And I will release my medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so that you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing.</p><p>BURNETT:  Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records?</p><p>BIDEN:  Before the first vote.</p><p>BURNETT:  Before Iowa?</p><p>BIDEN:  Yes.</p><p>BURNETT:  Not by the end of this year?</p><p>BIDEN:  Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I've released them before. I released 55 pages of my -- I'm the only guy that's released anything up here.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. Forty percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, I say, I will out-work, out-organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, or whoever the Republicans get stuck with.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Look, the way I see this, the way we're going to win is by addressing head-on what millions of Americans know in their bones, and that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind.</p><p>And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of big problems in this country is a winning strategy. They are wrong.</p><p>If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual, then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what's broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives, things like childcare and health care and housing costs. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in the fight.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator Warren.</p><p>Congresswoman Gabbard, you're 38 years old, and you would be the youngest president if elected. Should age matter when choosing a president?</p><p>GABBARD:  I'm glad you asked, because I was going to say it's not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as president but not every other one of us. I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape.</p><p>But here's the real question I believe you should be asking is: Who is fit to serve as our commander-in-chief? This is the most important responsibility that the president has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him, inviting Turkey to come in and slaughter the Kurds, show what an unfit president looks like. It highlights how critical it is that we have a president and commander-in-chief who is ready on day one, bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security.</p><p>Bringing the experience that I have, both serving in Congress now for nearly seven years, serving on the Foreign Affairs Committee, serving on the Armed Services Committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland Security Committee, the experience that I have as a soldier, serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard.</p><p>I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief on day one.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>GABBARD:  I'd like to ask our other candidates this question. I'd like to start with Senator Warren...</p><p>BURNETT:  Sorry, Congressman, I'm sorry.</p><p>GABBARD:  ... what her experience and background is to serve as commander-in-chief.</p><p>BURNETT:  I'm sorry, thank you. We're going to take another break now. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio will be back in just a few moments.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX a few moments.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  And welcome back to the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?</p><p>YANG:  As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.</p><p>But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.</p><p>So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.</p><p>Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.</p><p>WARREN:  Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place:  that's Amazon.</p><p>It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, your response?</p><p>STEYER:  Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.</p><p>But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.</p><p>In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?</p><p>BOOKER:  Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.</p><p>And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.</p><p>And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.</p><p>Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when, in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.</p><p>And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.</p><p>So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Sanders, your response?</p><p>SANDERS:  When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?</p><p>HARRIS:  No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.</p><p>But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.</p><p>And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.</p><p>Because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.</p><p>We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.</p><p>WARREN:  So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.</p><p>HARRIS:  Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.</p><p>WARREN:  But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...</p><p>HARRIS:  No?</p><p>WARREN:  ... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.</p><p>HARRIS:  You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.</p><p>WARREN:  I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.</p><p>You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?</p><p>WARREN:  ... that support us all.</p><p>HARRIS:  You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>HARRIS:  Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.</p><p>LACEY:  Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACEY:  Your response?</p><p>HARRIS:  I'm not finished. I'm not finished.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARRIS:  And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.</p><p>WARREN:  Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.</p><p>HARRIS:  So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?</p><p>WARREN:  What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.</p><p>And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.</p><p>But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro-competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  And this means everything from tech on down.</p><p>LACEY:  Please respond.</p><p>CASTRO:  Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.</p><p>And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.</p><p>LACEY:  Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YANG:  The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Yang.</p><p>GABBARD:  There's a bigger issue here...</p><p>BURNETT:  Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?</p><p>HARRIS:  My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.</p><p>Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.</p><p>The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Harris, thank you.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.</p><p>That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, thank you.</p><p>Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.</p><p>And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.</p><p>I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?</p><p>GABBARD:  This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.</p><p>I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.</p><p>I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you very much.</p><p>The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.</p><p>Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?</p><p>BIDEN:  I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.</p><p>I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.</p><p>The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.</p><p>And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.</p><p>And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.</p><p>What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.</p><p>Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.</p><p>There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  ... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?</p><p>CASTRO:  I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.</p><p>I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?</p><p>WARREN:  I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.</p><p>But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.</p><p>What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.</p><p>BURNETT:  Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.</p><p>BURNETT:  Thank you very much, Senator.</p><p>COOPER:  As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.</p><p>Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?</p><p>BIDEN:  Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.</p><p>I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.</p><p>And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.</p><p>COOPER:  Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?</p><p>MORE</p><p>XXX is being vague?</p><p>BIDEN:  Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?</p><p>COOPER:  You'll both get in.</p><p>BIDEN:  If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?</p><p>SANDERS:  Two things. Let me explain in two ways.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, respond.</p><p>SANDERS:  Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.</p><p>Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS:  If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.</p><p>COOPER:  Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.</p><p>BIDEN:  We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.</p><p>SANDERS:  No.</p><p>BIDEN:  We can.</p><p>SANDERS:  No, you can't.</p><p>BIDEN:  And we can afford to do it.</p><p>SANDERS:  You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry.</p><p>BIDEN:  By the way, the greed and...</p><p>COOPER:  Let him respond. Mr. Vice President?</p><p>BIDEN:  The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance, and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Warren, your response?</p><p>WARREN:  So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed.</p><p>And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated.</p><p>I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  ... and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  ... for the things that touch people's lives.</p><p>COOPER:  Mayor...</p><p>BIDEN:  I agree. Let me -- she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight, too.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Warren, do you want to respond?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand...</p><p>BIDEN:  You did a hell of a job in your job.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  I said, no, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have...</p><p>BIDEN:  Not me.</p><p>WARREN:  We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change.</p><p>COOPER:  Mayor Buttigieg, which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump? That's the essential question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.</p><p>We're being offered a false choice. I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration. I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal. Because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.</p><p>But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.</p><p>Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further, free college for low- and middle-income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we've done...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  ... in my lifetime...</p><p>COOPER:  Senator?</p><p>BIDEN:  I did not say back to normal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mayor. Senator Klobuchar? Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  Thank you. You know, this isn't a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're bold.</p><p>But we can't get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win. And what I have done is win and the only one up here, time and time again, the reddest of red districts, Michele Bachmann's, I -- I won that district three times, rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable.</p><p>And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and all over Ohio and in Iowa, because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you. Senator Warren, she referenced you, so you can respond.</p><p>WARREN:  Now, people who are struggling to pay health care are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today.</p><p>And anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who is likely to win them. For me, this is about knowing what's broken, knowing how to fix it, and, yes, I'm willing to get out there and fight for it.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  There's a missing people, and that is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, why is your approach more likely to beat President Trump?</p><p>SANDERS:  I'll tell you why.</p><p>COOPER:  Please respond.</p><p>SANDERS:  And here's the radical reason why. It's what the American people want.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>SANDERS:  All right, the American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71 percent of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we've got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren.</p><p>The way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old. You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You've got to bring working people and young people and poor people into the political process...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>SANDERS:  ... because they know you stand for them, not corporate America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman O'Rourke, is political revolution what the American people want? Your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress, I found that El Paso, Texas, had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental health care provider at the V.A. I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I serve.</p><p>So we set about turning around the V.A., hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country. And we were able to do that, and we took what we learned, and we applied it to a national law as a member of the minority working with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand mental health care access for veterans nationally.</p><p>And then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE:  ... talking about this progressive agenda, and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won, that's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020.</p><p>COOPER:  Congressman O'Rourke, thank you. We have to take a quick break. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Ohio will continue right after this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>COOPER:  We are back with the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on.</p><p>Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.</p><p>So in that spirit, we'd like you to tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us and what impact it's had on you and your beliefs.</p><p>Secretary Castro, let's begin with you.</p><p>CASTRO:  Well, first of all, thank you to Marc, thank you, Anderson, and thank you, Erin, and CNN, and New York Times and everybody who is here tonight.</p><p>You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me, or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.</p><p>And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.</p><p>I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.</p><p>I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.</p><p>And there are people, whether it's our former president, George W. Bush, or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done.</p><p>COOPER:  Congresswoman Gabbard?</p><p>GABBARD:  Thank you. You know, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with \"aloha.\" It's not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we're all connected, we're all brothers and sisters, we're all God's children.</p><p>So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially, with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We've developed a friendship that's based on respect. And he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.</p><p>The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.</p><p>When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.</p><p>So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR:  For me, it's John McCain, and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.\"</p><p>And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this:  \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"</p><p>That's what we're doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win -- and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate -- is by winning big.</p><p>And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that's out there today, but it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this. And I ask you to join me because I've done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>STEYER:  So I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She's a different gender. She's a different race. She's from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.</p><p>My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York Public Schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.</p><p>And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.</p><p>I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke?</p><p>O'ROURKE:  I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges, regardless of the differences. I did that as a small-business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>Did it as a member of the City Council, where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.</p><p>As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the V.A. there, March of 2017. Found that my flight had been snowed in, in Washington, D.C. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim, I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?</p><p>And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1,600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.</p><p>By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue.</p><p>And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat. We won independents and Republicans in record numbers, as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>BOOKER:  Well, look, I have so many, I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship, even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle.</p><p>I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan, and he's a meat-eating Texan.</p><p>But I'll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test. The spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history. Rugged individualism didn't get us to the Moon. It didn't beat the Nazis. It didn't map the human genome. It didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big.</p><p>And, Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.</p><p>This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic of grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.</p><p>And love is not sentimentality. It's not anemic. Love is struggle. Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other...</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER:  ... our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER:  And if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator. Mr. Yang?</p><p>YANG:  First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home. And if you don't feel like you answered your -- you got your question answered tonight, it's understandable. There are 12 of us.</p><p>I'm going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My web site, yang2020.com. And if you ask your question tonight, there's a better chance I'll get to it.</p><p>My surprising friendship, it's been so much fun running for president, because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.</p><p>And I'm happy to say that, after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we remained in touch ever since.</p><p>The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party.</p><p>Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we're going to build a wall, we're going to turn the clock back, we're going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward. And that is where we must take the country in 2020.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Mr. Yang, thank you very much. Senator Harris?</p><p>HARRIS:  Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I -- actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, \"Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this.\" And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.</p><p>And I guess that's why I'm running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country, we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.</p><p>And I'll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone. And she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer. And so she arrived in California. She got -- you know, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father, and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended.</p><p>But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney general of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, and I will tell you, that's part of why I'm running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideas will always hold true.</p><p>And so that's what is at stake in this election. And I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives.</p><p>When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other.</p><p>In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you can go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.</p><p>It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create. And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.</p><p>I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders?</p><p>SANDERS:  When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history. And I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board.</p><p>And I worked with John McCain. I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration.</p><p>More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S. -- get the votes to get the U.S. troops out of that area.</p><p>But I think, at the end of day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion.</p><p>And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator Warren?</p><p>WARREN:  You ask about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican.</p><p>And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was. But he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.</p><p>You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three elder brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we're divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together.</p><p>We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in.</p><p>Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.</p><p>People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more, we want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden?</p><p>BIDEN:  This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.</p><p>The two people maybe would surprise you the most were -- he's been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.</p><p>And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.</p><p>And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.</p><p>Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.</p><p>And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake, get up. Get up and remember, there is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER:  Candidates, thank you. That concludes the fourth Democratic presidential debate. We want to thank Otterbein University for hosting us. Now please stay tuned to CNN for special coverage of tonight's debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2305662075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X92-WXS1-DY0W-4101-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"30150\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Oct 16, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AEN</classCode><className>DIAL GLOBAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Apple releases this new bunch to the iPhone 11s, they are now on sale. And going rogue, an oil trader in Singapore has cost Mitsubishi -- drumroll -- $320 million. It's Friday and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to FIRST MOVE. Great to have you with us. We're winding down an incredibly eventful week here on Wall Street filled with -- let's get this straight -- a Fed rate cut, a spike in oil prices - a historic one, and yet a historic financial market credit crunch. And guess what guys? It is Friday, but the week on Wall Street is not over yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we all await that opening bell, futures are pointing as you can see right there to a higher open on Wall Street, a bit modest, but despite all the drama, stocks, you know what, they are pretty much flat for the week, and still hovering close to those record highs and that's important to have some perspective as well.</p><p>Now before the bell, we're hearing a fresh Goodwill Hunting in the U.S.- China trade war. The U.S. is reportedly dropping tariffs, yes, dropping tariffs on more than 400 Chinese products temporarily. All this comes as U.S. and Chinese negotiators sit down for another round of talks in Washington.</p><p>Now, they are preparing for the high level discussions that are still set to begin next month. White House Economic adviser, Larry Kudlow says he feels quote, \"a little softening in the air\" and of course around the table as well.</p><p>Meantime, stocks are rising in Europe. Asia stocks finished mixed with the Shanghai Composite posting gains. Chinese officials trimmed the short-term interest rates for a second straight month today to help those companies that are still suffering from that trade war.</p><p>As you can see there though, Hong Kong stocks, however, fell sharply over the week. Look at that Hang Seng, it is now up just over two percent year- to-date as months of anti-government protests batter that local economy.</p><p>We want to get straight to our drivers though. We begin in Saudi Arabia where we are getting a first-hand look at the damage inflicted on a vital oil facility last weekend.</p><p>Now, the attacks knocked out, remember, five percent of the world's daily oil production. Saudi officials tell us they are proud of how their emergency services responded. Our Nic Robertson visited one of the facilities and saw the damage firsthand.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR: Officials here say they went on-site putting out the fire within 10 minutes of the first explosion. They say that they were effective getting it under control within about five minutes. At the other explosions, they say it took them about four or five hours here to get those fires under control. They are proud they say that within 24 hours, they got capacity up here, back up to 30 percent.</p><p>But the real problem for Saudi Arabia right now is not in reviving the full production here at this plant. But the recovery of international confidence that this is a one-off strike, but not a signal of a wider war to come. Nic Robertson, CNN, Khurais, Saudi Arabia.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: And that will be the tough part there. We will continue to see Nic throughout the day as he continues his reporting from those oil facilities.</p><p>Now, turning to India, it has slashed corporate taxes in a bid to defend growth. Now, the move amounts to a $20 billion hit to government revenues for a big tax cut for companies. Clare Sebastian joins me. I'm interested in this move by the Indian government because in terms of their toolbox, they decided to take this one out. But to what end? Because sometimes there are mixed results from this kind of a thing.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right, absolutely. It is a gamble on the fiscal deficit essentially, Paula, they are at risk now according to some analysts from meeting their target for the year, but their calculation is that this will spur productivity, it will spur private investment and that will lead to increase tax revenues over the long run.</p><p>So you know, this is a big cut to corporate tax. It's been well-received by the business community. I want to pull up a tweet today from the CEO of one of India's smaller private sector banks. He called this a big bang reform. He said it allows Indian companies to compete with the lower tax jurisdictions like the U.S. He called it a bold progressive step forward.</p><p>And we can see that the stock market as well up today five percent on the news that's about a two-month high. But this is -- part of what India is facing at the moment, its economy has been on a really steep decline this year.</p><p>Growth in the June quarter was at five percent, that's down from eight percent in the same period last year, and the government is really being forced to step in and take some big steps to try and spur growth.</p><p>I think you're right, it remains to be seen whether this will be enough, but certainly, it is being seen as a big step today.</p><p>[09:05:02]</p><p>NEWTON: And in terms of that big step, I mean, India is under a lot of pressure right now to try and prove that those growth rates that they really need, they desperately need that they'll get there. Any other hints about other stimulus that might be on the way?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Well, certainly they've been cutting interest rates, Paula. They may go further in that regard. But there are kind of issues in individual parts of the economy as well. The auto sector, which is a big part of GDP has been on a steep decline. July was its worst month in 18 years. Hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost. Rural areas have been particularly hard hit as the economy has been slowing down.</p><p>And all of this relates back to a couple of shocks that the economy has had in recent years. There was that demonetization in 2016, and a new goods and services tax came in in 2017. The OECD saying yesterday that the Indian government should make moves to simplify that even further, and that will help the revenues to be distributed to the areas that needs spending the most.</p><p>But I think once thing to watch here is if the government does miss its fiscal deficit target because of this tax cut, will they have to cut spending? And what will that mean for the people?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and that's the issue where you put that stimulus. Clare Sebastian, thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>And we go now to the view from the White House where we have Donald Trump who is greeting the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. You see a lovely view there. Quite a red carpet welcome there for the Prime Minister, a lot of things at stake here and a lot of it has to do with security issues in Asia vis-a-vis China.</p><p>The President is also sure to talk about trade issues, obviously, principally with China, but also Donald Trump wanting to also strengthen trade ties with Australia going forward.</p><p>And as you see there, Scott Morrison and his wife getting out of the vehicle there and greeting the First Lady and President Trump.</p><p>Donald Trump came into office saying that he wanted to strengthen trading relationships with countries like Australia, a bit of mixed results right now. The Australians are very close, in terms of advising other countries about what to do with China -- mixed success there, but at the same time with so much at stake and with Chinese negotiators on the ground today in Washington, trying to set up the platform for new talks in October.</p><p>And you can see them they're just posing for pictures. At issue as well is of course the Five Eyes security establishment which also involves Australia. It has been under strain, giving leaks not just in the United States, but in other countries as well. And a lot of strain in terms of that information sharing, how it is done, how accurate it is and how effective it can be. No doubt that will also be on the agenda.</p><p>We expect that perhaps that they will have some kind of media opportunity in the coming moments or hours and we will bring it to you when we get that.</p><p>Switching gears now, we go to the Apple fans. Yes sir. Still, many of them. They're waiting to get their hands on the latest iPhone today in store. The iPhone 11 is finally on the shelves. There is plenty of cheers.</p><p>That is the CEO, Tim Cook who opened up the Apple Store at New York's Fifth Avenue. They are kind of treating him like a rock star there. I guess they were trying to drive up some of the publicity. Samantha Kelly joins me. Samantha, I take it you have seen these phones. You have tested these phones. What's your review coming out of that?</p><p>SAMANTHA KELLY, CNN BUSINESS EDITOR: Yes, so I've been playing with them for a few days now. So this is the iPhone 11 Pro, there's also a bigger size, the Max. And this is the iPhone 11.</p><p>So the iPhone 11 and the Pro are actually pretty similar. The major difference is, there are -- the camera here, there are three different lenses that help you zoom and zoom out and just take, you know, honestly very stunning photos.</p><p>The Pro -- the other Pro line in general has lots of different new features. But there's a lot that you can actually get on the base model. And it's $50.00 cheaper than last year's base model and $300.00 cheaper than the Pro line, and this is an excellent phone. It comes in a lot of new different colors.</p><p>But you know, at the end of the day, I would say that a lot of these changes are pretty incremental. Apple has to do a lot right now to kind of increase sales and that price point is going to try to get people to upgrade.</p><p>But at the end of the day, again, people are upgrading a lot -- it's taking a lot longer than it used to.</p><p>NEWTON: It's taking a lot longer than it used to because most people as you said, the incremental changes are not something that they're into at this point.</p><p>You know, I don't think perhaps the things that drive us crazy every day is the charging of the phone, things like being -- that the Huawei now has, which is the two slots for the two SIM cards. Is this worth the upgrade at this point?</p><p>I mean, Tim Cook and Apple seem very optimistic, and yet when you actually try and get people to spend that cash on upgrading, is there really a need to at this point?</p><p>[09:10:04]</p><p>KELLY: Sure. So third party companies are kind of looking at presales and sort of the interest around that and it seems like more people are interested in these devices than they were last year, even though they are relatively incremental.</p><p>But yes, will people upgrade? I think people every cycle are going to upgrade, especially if you haven't upgraded in a few years. These are excellent top of the line phones and especially now with the iPhone 11, you can get a phone that does so much more than just what a phone did a few years ago. So there's definitely reason to upgrade.</p><p>Next year, we're expecting much bigger changes. Apple is expected to launch a 5G phone which will be even faster and allow you to do things that we haven't even -- we don't even know yet because the services aren't out there yet. But it is supposed to be a way more groundbreaking than we are now.</p><p>So will people upgrade? I think if you need a new phone, then these are excellent options.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, that's the key thing, if you actually need one. Samantha, thanks so much for taking us through that. Appreciate it.</p><p>KELLY: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: And as you can see there, President Trump along with the Prime Minister of Australia and his wife and the First Lady there, it looks like they're getting ready to make remarks as there is a podium. We will continue to keep an eye on that.</p><p>Guess what? Another person in Washington and that was Mark Zuckerberg the other night having dinner with the President. He had that face-to-face meeting in the Oval Office. Mark Zuckerberg has been in Washington for a series of meetings with some of his platform's most vocal critics.</p><p>Brian Fung is in Washington and joins me now. He's been watching it all. You know, I was actually stunned by some of the blunt language that the politicians are literally saying to him, no, no, no, sell this, sell Instagram. So what's up? This is what you should be doing right now. Was there an indication that Facebook knew what they were getting into and what this visit is all about at the end of the day?</p><p>BRIAN FUNG, CNN TECHNOLOGY REPORTER: Well, I think Facebook probably knew what it was in for as soon as they touched down. You know, Facebook obviously has been under a lot of pressure from regulators and policymakers, and this is really the first visit by Zuckerberg to the nation's capital since he testified to Congress last April about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>But you know, he sat down with number of senators for dinner on Wednesday night. On Thursday, he met with Senator Josh Hawley, who is a major tech critic and called on him to sell off WhatsApp and Instagram.</p><p>Apparently, according to Hawley, Zuckerberg wasn't too thrilled with that proposal. But, you know, they had a frank discussion about, you know, things like digital data, privacy and elections security. And then Zuckerberg went on to meet with President Trump, and while Facebook isn't saying much about what actually went on in that meeting, Trump tweeted a photo of the exchange later and said it was a nice meeting. So you know, we're sort of still sort of guessing as to what may have gone on there.</p><p>Today, Zuckerberg is expected to meet with Adam Schiff, the House Intelligence Committee Chairman, as well as a number of Members of the House Judiciary Committee, including David Cicilline, who is, of course leading a month-long antitrust investigation of the tech industry.</p><p>In fact, last week, Cicilline sent a number of letters to Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google asking them all to submit, you know, detailed documentation about some of their dealings with the government in the past.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, I mean, the antitrust issue is obviously the issue. And, you know, Congress is looking at the legacy of this and saying, we've done it before, we don't see why we shouldn't do with a company like Facebook.</p><p>What's the endgame for Facebook here? Do they feel like getting in there, they can set some of the parameters of what might be coming from government?</p><p>FUNG: Well, I think the regulators and the policymakers are going to do what they're going to do, but I think probably Facebook feels that, you know, if they can, you know, come off looking like they're more approachable, trying to be reasonable, trying to engage on a meaningful scale, in good faith that perhaps, you know, that will lead to more lenient treatment.</p><p>NEWTON: Brian, thanks so much. It is a story that we will continue to watch. And while Mark Zuckerberg and the President maybe weren't saying too much, congressional leaders have certainly been pretty vocal what they want to happen in the future. Brian, appreciate it.</p><p>And we turn to the stories have making headlines around the world. Back to that White House shot now, as you see President Trump is hosting Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. They will hold a joint press conference later today, as well as a full State Dinner.</p><p>Meantime, questions swirl all over President Trump and a reported whistleblower. Sources tell CNN the U.S. government's top intelligence watchdog has suggested that a controversial whistleblower complaint raises concerns about multiple actions.</p><p>The Inspector General did not specify if those actions involved President Trump. The report say part of the concern involves the President's contacts with a foreign leader</p><p>[09:15:10]</p><p>NEWTON: Right now, across the planet, people are marching for the planet with global strikes and protest to call for action on climate change. You see the pictures right there from Australia to Dublin to Berlin and New York City.</p><p>They've given more than a million students permission to skip school, and some companies are also supporting employees for taking part in the strikes. Another big day of action is planned about a week from now.</p><p>And the first ever Rugby World Cup is set to take place in Asia and it's now underway in Japan. Now the host took on Russia in the tournament's first match, which took place at a packed stadium in Tokyo. After 48 matches, the winner will be crowned in November. Japan won the first match 30 to 10. I can't imagine how loud it was in that stadium.</p><p>Still to come on FIRST MOVE, life in the fast lane, we get the low down on Uber's path to fame and fortune from the author of the tell-all book on the Kalanick era.</p><p>And sun, sea and bankruptcy? Will thousands of holidaymakers be left stranded far from home? Tour operator, Thomas Cook is on the brink of collapse.</p><p>NEWTON: And welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We are once again showing you live pictures from the White House there. That is Scott Morrison, next to President Trump and their wives.</p><p>They are getting quite a roll out here on the lawn of the White House. This is a full State Visit, so they will get this kind of a welcome. There are bilateral meetings. There is then a full joint press conference and a State Dinner to follow.</p><p>These are two countries looking to strengthen their ties, especially when it comes to trade but also when it comes to security. Certainly, China will be top of mind for both of these leaders as they continue what will be extensive talks, but also as you can see there, President Trump really wanting to extend a warm welcome to the Australian Prime Minister and his wife and really, a candid measure of where he wants this relationship to go in the next few years.</p><p>[09:20:12]</p><p>NEWTON: We will return to the markets where futures are pointing to a higher Wall Street open. The S&amp;P 500 is riding a three-session winning streak. Yes, after all that, we're on a winning streak and the NASDAQ is on track for its fourth straight week of gains.</p><p>We've got a number of Fed officials speaking today on rate policy just two days after the Central Bank's latest quarter point cut. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard says he still believes that a half point cut -- remember, he was the dissenter there -- would have been the best course of action because of the continued weakness in U.S. manufacturing. No surprise as to the data he is looking at.</p><p>Meantime though, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, a rate cut hawk says he sees no need for any further Fed easing. Interesting, the dissension there on the Fed.</p><p>We are going to return to the White House where the President is speaking.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... members of the Australian delegation, and distinguished guests. Today, we celebrate the long cherished and unwavering friendship between the United States and Australia.</p><p>The First Lady and I are honored to welcome you and Jennifer to the White House and we look forward to hosting you for a State Dinner tonight in the Rose Garden, it will be quite something.</p><p>The unbreakable bond between America and Australia is rooted in eternal ties of history, culture and tradition.</p><p>Last year, our nations commemorated 100 years of mate-ship since our gallant service members fought together in World War I. Today, we vowed to carry on the righteous legacy of our exceptional alliance.</p><p>The close relationship between our two countries dates back to the earliest days of the American Republic. In 1792, during George Washington's first term, the American ship, Philadelphia became the first foreign trading vessel to enter an Australian port.</p><p>In the coming decades American prospectors, whalers and merchants traveled to Australia for opportunity and adventure. They found in your people a kindred spirit. Americans and Aussies are loyal, bold, independent, and very, very resilient.</p><p>With incredible optimism and grit, our forefathers built homes and nations in the lands of endless beauty and possibility. Together, we share common customs, common values, common dreams, and common heroes.</p><p>In the First World War, our bond was sealed in blood at the Battle of Hamel in France. In the words of Australian General John Monash, the events that took place there live forever in the annals of our respective nations. General --</p><p>NEWTON: That was President Trump in fact welcoming Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia to the White House. He calls it an important mate- ship. So I think the President at this point in time would like to make it clear that he is rolling out the red carpet for this country, a lot of security.</p><p>Relationships depend on it and crucially, as well, Australia will be helping out in the Strait of Hormuz in terms of securing oil supplies for the world. And that is also something that will come up today, as well as I say, that trading relationship with China.</p><p>And we want to turn now to big tech, Facebook CEO as we were saying was also in Washington to try and build bridges the head of the 2020 election amid growing scrutiny if the Silicon Valley, but bad behavior might lead to bad press.</p><p>My next guest says for most in Silicon Valley, it rarely leads to meaningful consequences. Joining me now is the author of, \"Super Pumped: The Battle for Uber.\" Mike Isaac joins me now. You know, what was interesting here? I think that as toxic and dysfunctional as we all thought Uber was, you in fact, characterize it as even more shocking than any one of us knew. And yet, you know, as we just pointed out in the lead into you, what had been the consequences for that?</p><p>MIKE ISAAC, AUTHOR: Yes, that's the sort of dismal outcome of this whole thing. You know, anyone who was involved in Uber early on is a millionaire at this point. Travis Kalanick, the CEO who had this culture fostered under him is a billionaire multiple times over and all the VCs who invested early have done really well.</p><p>So you know, there might be constantly in the public behavior and sort of the idea that you might not be welcome in fine company, but at the same time, there are millionaires, in there, if not billionaires that continue to sort of do the same thing.</p><p>[09:25:13]</p><p>NEWTON: You know, I'm interested to hear from you, beyond Travis's personality in the first instance, how much do you think private equity, though, as you said, those venture capitalists, how much do you think they contribute to this? Because there's been a phenomenon that I've seen in the last decade, where those companies just hang on to their private status at times, when in other epochs, we would have gone for an IPO so much sooner?</p><p>ISAAC: Absolutely. I think, you know, Uber was the sort of poster child of staying public -- or staying private, as long as possible. I think Facebook had stayed private for a long amount of time. But Kalanick in particular had this idea in his head that once you go public, you just have much more scrutiny on your finances, and we're seeing that right now with Uber in the public markets, you know, they keep losing billions of dollars every quarter.</p><p>I think there will probably be a push to bring companies public much sooner, because the ones that have stayed private for a very long time are starting to see the effects of the market on the on these newly public companies. But I don't know, you know, it's just sort of up to the VCs and the founders to push themselves out the door.</p><p>NEWTON: Which is an exclusive club, and then you have a very close set of hands trying to determine what happens to a company that as you said, the accountability isn't there. And people have been, obviously riding Uber's for an extended period of time.</p><p>A few things here about the personality of the person who used to lead this company. Was it the soul factor? Or do you think the atmosphere around him was very permissive? No one stood up to him.</p><p>ISAAC: Yes, I think he ran into a really familiar problem, which is if you surround yourself with people who just say yes to you all the time, and don't really challenge you, you can end up getting away with a lot of different things.</p><p>You know, Travis was very resilient, very sort of strong headed, and to give him credit, he pushed into a very guarded transportation space that had not changed for many years.</p><p>The problem was, he didn't really realize that once he disrupted taxi and delivery services, he became the dominant figure and kept acting as if he was a scrappy startup. And that was ultimately, what did the man in the end along with many of the deep culture issues?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, absolutely. And you certainly see the repercussions now in terms of many cities really going in quite hard now with that regulation. I want to talk to you a little bit about that government footprint now.</p><p>You know, we were talking about Facebook earlier, and the fact that they're in Washington, that regulation is coming down. And look, it's not like the government has a good track record on trying to regulate some of these industries.</p><p>At the same time, and I'm sure you've looked at this, when you talk about, you know, American antitrust history here, and we're talking about Ma Bell or even talking about Microsoft and some have argued, if the government didn't come down on Microsoft early on, then we wouldn't have Google, we wouldn't have this other ecosystem.</p><p>Where do you fall on that? Because I know you've done a lot of work on this. And whether it's Uber in smaller local markets and cities trying to get a hold on them, or Facebook, where we're trying to deal with the global ecosystem. What do you think?</p><p>ISAAC: Yeah, no, no. It's a great point. I think we're, you know, you saw Zuckerberg on the Hill yesterday. And then today, just because he is starting to realize that part of being a tech CEO now is kind of kissing the ring in Washington and making good with these folks who are threatening to rein them in, I think probably for the past 10 to 15, even 20 years, the government FTC, you know, any sort of regulatory action against tech has been largely nonexistent, basically, since U.S. versus Microsoft.</p><p>Now, we're sort of seeing this tech lash since 2016-2017, and I think there's probably going to be some action, you know, probably warranted, especially with this reach that a lot of these companies have, but you know, we'll see how much tooth the FTC has because there's a lot of criticisms that they're not going far enough.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. And the question is, though, where do you go with it? Just returning to Uber for a moment in terms of that company and its profitability, do you think it would have been completely different had it not been private and privately held in Mr. Kalanick's hands for so long a period of time?</p><p>ISAAC: Yes, no, I think that's a great, great sort of point. Because there are things you can do as a private company that you can't do as a public company, one of which is burn billions of dollars at an incredible rate.</p><p>I think Uber right now as you're seeing them in the first few months of its being a public company, they're losing billions every quarter. Last quarter, they lost more than $5 billion, and the market is reacting accordingly and saying essentially, like, we can't let you continue to lose that much money. We want to see you as a profitable company.</p><p>So I think I think the discipline that comes with being a public company is very important. And I think more and more tech companies are going realize that as time goes on.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and the issue is that they just sorted an entire market while they were doing that, right? I mean, in so many cities around the globe.</p><p>[09:30:07]</p><p>ISAAC: That's right. No, I mean, you know, and that's the credit that I give them is pushing into hundreds of cities across the world almost on every continent. The problem is like a lot of those rides were subsidized, and once we get to a point of the company being profitable, we'll see what those fares look like.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, I've noticed my discounts have dried up on Uber as well as I am sure many others.</p><p>ISAAC: Exactly.</p><p>NEWTON: Mike, a fascinating look into the company, and as I said, it has so many implications not just for Uber, but for so many of these so-called unicorns that we have seen and that we will continue to see. Thanks so much for coming in. Really appreciate it.</p><p>ISAAC: Yes, thanks for having me.</p><p>NEWTON: And we will have much more news right here on FIRST MOVE right after the break.</p><p>[09:33:50]</p><p>NEWTON: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. I'm Paula Newton. The opening bell rang just a short time ago at the New York Stock Exchange and we do have a higher open on Wall Street on the last trading day of the week.</p><p>Stocks are inching closer to those record highs, but we do stress inching. The S&amp;P 500 is only a half percent away from records. The Trump administration is reportedly making new goodwill tariff gestures to China that is helping the mood a little bit there on the markets.</p><p>Today is another quarterly futures and options expiration day, if I can say that on Wall Street, which means it could be a volatile date for stocks and again up or down especially so close to that record.</p><p>I want to show you oil now, it is moving higher again on global markets. Its track is to rise some seven percent this week, its largest weekly gains since the beginning of the year following the attacks on Saudi Arabia.</p><p>What's interesting here is that oil prices have there, risen again more people trying to take into account that geopolitical risk. Joining me now is DJ Peterson. He is the President of Longview Global Advisors. The market has so badly wanted to shrug off even this and yet it seems unable to.</p><p>Let's deal first with that geopolitical risk of that, you know, obviously would so hamper energy markets. Do you still see it as a risk because some people say that there's a lot of oil sloshing around the globe, and that even after an attack like this, supplies would still be fine.</p><p>[09:35:16]</p><p>DJ PETERSON, PRESIDENT, LONGVIEW GLOBAL ADVISORS: That's right, and oil prices today are still below where they were a year ago. And there's really concern -- a lot of concern -- about the trajectory of the global economy and slack demand for oil. Plus you have rising production in North America.</p><p>So there, in many cases, yes, there is enough oil out there, and certainly the Saudis have been saying that we are going to work as quickly as possible to assure supplies to the market. You have the United States and China with strategic reserves, which also can be tapped if needed.</p><p>So there's been a lot of efforts to reassure the markets. But I think one question is, you know, will we be in a higher oil price for a longer period than many expected and what does this do to global growth?</p><p>NEWTON: And going into the attacks themselves, and the risk of this happening again or happening somewhere else? And of course, we can discuss the Strait of Hormuz as well, and the risks there. Do you believe that the markets are actually adequately factoring in how volatile it is, especially given the fact that Iran seems to be unleashed now, right? There doesn't seem to be even a proportional military response in the offing.</p><p>PETERSON: Right, the situation is very unpredictable. I think, right now, you have a lot of uncertainty about what the next move is going to be. What is Iran's move, as you said, I think they're feeling very strong and confident because there hasn't been a significant response, just threats.</p><p>We have freelancing in Saudi Arabia, and we're not clear what the decision making is there. We've seen in the past few years, some very poor decisions being made in the international relations arena in Riyadh.</p><p>We have a messaging coming out of Washington, out of the White House, which has been clearly contradictory and mixed messages. And so we don't even know what the thinking is in the White House. And we also have a changeover of national security leadership going on.</p><p>And then of course, there's other issues right now on in the news that are kind of preoccupying the administration regarding this whistleblower. And so there's a lot of factors going on right now. It's very possible -- nobody predicted this move, this strike on Saudi Arabia. So it's impossible to say there's not going to be another hit in the near future.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and especially that Iran, if it does seem emboldened out of this, there might be another one. And yet the market really was quite resilient throughout all of this. It hasn't been quite as resilient on the global trade tensions specifically against the U.S. and China recently. How good -- materially good -- does a deal have to be for these markets to accept it and for global growth to really get back on sure footing?</p><p>PETERSON: Well, what you're seeing is the markets responding very positively to very minor news announcements, such as there are going to be talks, or there has been a meeting.</p><p>I think what we're seeing right now, in our view, the term to watch is mini deal. We are seeing an effort perhaps to have a very limited deal with China, U.S.-China, but also with Japan, with India, in very limited arenas, in particular key agricultural segments.</p><p>In some cases, these mini deals are just dialing back the measures that the Trump administration has imposed. But the point is, is that the President wants some good news, and to say his trade agenda is moving forward for the election.</p><p>Now, the material benefit to the economy is going to be from these mini deals, and in some cases, they are interim or short term. It is going to be very specific, and it's going to be very focused. Harley-Davidson motorcycles, perhaps something for Huawei. And then, of course, pork and soy beans.</p><p>But it's not going to be any kind of broad deal, and it's certainly not going to give us confidence over the longer term. What we've seen is there are many opportunities, for instance, in the China relationship to get tripped up around technology now perhaps around Hong Kong.</p><p>NEWTON: And we will not be seeing what the President wanted, which was a better manufacturing data out of the United States if we have that comprehensive deal. DJ Peterson, The president of Longview Global Advisors. Thanks so much for being here. Really appreciate it.</p><p>PETERSON: You're welcome.</p><p>NEWTON: Now after the break on FIRST MOVE, their catchphrase was, you know, don't just book it, Thomas Cook it. Now thousands of travelers face an anxious way to see if the world's oldest holiday company survives into next week.</p><p>[09:43:00]</p><p>NEWTON: In Britain, the company that invented the package holiday is now at risk of collapse. Thomas Cook is scrambling to find $250 million just to stay afloat and prevent thousands of holidaymakers from being stranded across Europe.</p><p>Anna Stewart has been following all of this from London and you're going to explain what Operation: Matterhorn is, and thank goodness there is one. How many people could potentially be affected by this and what's being done about it?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Well right now, Paula, 600,000 people are right now abroad on a Thomas Cook holiday with a flight, so that is a lot of people. A Hundred sixty thousand of those are British. So there's a big British problem, of course it's a British company and as you said reportedly, the British aviation regulator has set up Operation: Matterhorn.</p><p>Now this is a huge repatriation plan that apparently would cost around $750 million to get everyone back home. There is huge pressure here in the U.K. given it is a British company, 178 year old British company. It survive two World Wars. It's been nationalized. It's thwarted off force off recession, and now it's going bust. Lots of pressure on the government and on British banks to step in and try and save it from complete collapse.</p><p>Also of course thinking about all these employees, 20,000 people work for Thomas Cook and right now, I think half the problem is so much media coverage. Lots of customers worried about their holidays. Lots of people not wanting to book with Thomas Cook, that's only going to make things worse -- Paula.</p><p>NEWTON: And what should passengers do if the worst happens and as you say, it's kind of tough to keep a viable business going when you have that kind of press?</p><p>STEWART: Incredibly difficult and you see on Twitter, Thomas Cook trying to reassure all customers out there. Now if the worst happens and it's such a big if, first of all, do not panic. You are not alone. As I said, there are 600,000 people currently abroad. It depends what you booked.</p><p>If you booked a package holiday through Thomas Cook, you are actually covered under what's called ATOL, it is an insurance scheme set up by the British aviation regulator. If you booked a flight and accommodations separately, you may have to go through your credit card, go through the fine print. You may be ATOL protected, you might not be. For non-Brits, you may have to go through your own country's regulator.</p><p>The first port of call, I think, Paula, it really is to go to the airline's website in this event. What would likely happen, a bit like when we have that Monarch Airlines collapse is you will get redirected to the British aviation regulator's own website to try and help you, but you won't be alone. There are plenty of people out there.</p><p>NEWTON: Not always inspiring to have to go to the website, but I take it that that's the best thing to do. And wow, what an eye-popping price tag potentially it could be, three quarters of a billion dollars. Wow. Okay. Anna Stewart will be on top of the story for us. Thank you.</p><p>And we are in today's \"Boardroom Brief\" right now. China is opening what you could call a mega airport. Look at that. You're looking at Beijing Daxing International Airport, which has four runways and a terminal the size of nearly 100 football pitches, and that's just the first phase. China is forecast to overtake the United States as the world's largest air travel market within three years.</p><p>And an update we have for you on Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case. The judge says the company and its subsidiaries can continue paying wages and bonuses to employees, former employees and retirees. The drug maker filed for bankruptcy as it faced demands to pay billions of dollars in damages over its alleged role in America's opioid crisis.</p><p>Cybersecurity is a multibillion dollar business, and despite stories about data breaches nearly every day, you have to wonder who is listening to the warnings. We've all seen the scams like e-mails filled with typos, perhaps a faraway King needs you to transfer some cash to him. Now it's more sophisticated.</p><p>One firm Proofpoint says it is blocking more than 600 million e-mail threats every day. The F.B.I. says more than $12 billion was lost in compromised e-mail attacks last year worldwide. And Proofpoint says nearly half nearly, every time they need some human interaction to make that work. The CEO Gary Steele told Alison Kosik where the last line of defense is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GARY STEELE, CEO, PROOFPOINT: I think we're all getting a little tired of hearing about the data breaches. I think the unfortunate reality is threat actors are making money, and so they continue to be motivated. There's more organizations entering that world. So there's actually more threats than ever before.</p><p>And the big shift in the threat landscape is it's moved from these threat actors targeting infrastructure, meaning writing sophisticated code to break into companies, to targeting individuals like yourself, and trying to get you to click on something and you to open some document or click on a link.</p><p>And so it's really shifted to be much more human centric than it's ever been before.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: So how do you prevent all this from happening? You said, you know, one of the things your company does is you keep those phishing e-mails we've been getting into the inbox, but what else can you do?</p><p>STEELE: So the other things you can do is you need to raise awareness on your employees, because people need to be thinking about it, while they're sitting in desk, while they are Starbucks, whether at home, it's everywhere, because the threat actors will follow you wherever you are.</p><p>And so being thoughtful and understanding what the risks are about clicking that link or opening that file.</p><p>KOSIK: Okay, so and you call them threat actors, but you know, crooks, hackers, whatever you want to call them, they are one step ahead of all of us, aren't they? So how do you stay one step ahead of them? How do you predict where they're going next? If they're going for the human element now, it means they are already plotting on what they're going for next, beyond the human, what are they going for next?</p><p>STEELE: So one of the things we do as a business, and it's one of the reasons we've continued to grow at a fast pace, is we have a set of researchers that follow the big threat actors around the globe. And we're watching what their trade craft looks like, and how that's evolving over time.</p><p>Right now, it really has evolved to analyzing individual and targeting them in a variety of ways, whether it's an e-mail or on social media, wherever that individual is, and wherever that threat actor can get through, that's where they'll go. And so we track them really carefully. We're watching their tradecraft. And that's what's enabled us to grow at a fast pace.</p><p>KOSIK: All right, so Proofpoint, one of your biggest competitors is Cisco Systems. So in an age where, you know, many companies are trying to, you know, reduce the number of vendors they're dealing with, reduce the number of products they have, you know, to have one function, maybe a single product company, how do you -- how does Proofpoint stay relevant against other companies that have an entire security architecture?</p><p>STEELE: You bet. So we've done a couple of things. So one is we've stayed very focused on this market and because of where the threat landscape has gone, our relevancy is increased over time.</p><p>So while Cisco has a broad product line, we stay very focused and that's been beneficial. Two is, our product line has grown significantly as well, and we've talked in our most recent earnings call, for example, we're now up to 18 products. So the breadth of our suite has increased, and so we're delivering a lot of value to our customers.</p><p>[09:50:03]</p><p>STEELE: So to your point, as organizations begin to consolidate vendors, we're in a great position to capture those dollars.</p><p>KOSIK: People watching, what can you do to protect yourself from hackers getting to you?</p><p>STEELE: So really three simple things. One is be careful before you click, whether it's a link or an attachment. Don't trust everything you see in an e-mail because they may be directing you to do something you shouldn't do like send a wire or send confidential information, and three, get educated and get smart about it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWTON: Still ahead, a very costly mistake. How a bet on the oil market cost Mitsubishi more than $300 million.</p><p>NEWTON: Mitsubishi is investigating how a rogue trader in Singapore cost the company $320 million after a bet on the oil market went very wrong. Our Matt Egan has the details. And you know, at issue here is how could one trader actually get into this much trouble? Are there no checks and balances?</p><p>MATT EGAN, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR WRITER: It's a good question, Paula. I think that the lesson here is if you're going to make an unauthorized trade, you better at least get it right. Because as you mentioned, this unauthorized trade by an employee at Mitsubishi is going to cost this firm at least $320 million.</p><p>Mitsubishi says that these were trades that were made by an employee at a subsidiary in Singapore. And what happened was, they're saying that these trades were made in January and the employee apparently was able to trick the risk management system by disguising them as hedges, right?</p><p>And so he made them look legit, according to the company, but in reality, they were actually bets. Well, that really went wrong when oil prices collapsed over the summer. So Mitsubishi said he discovered these unauthorized trades in August when the employee was out the office.</p><p>The company says they hired a law firm and they did an investigation. And this week they fired the employee, and they also alerted authorities. Mitsubishi says that even though they closed out these positions, the losses could actually still go above that $320 million estimate.</p><p>But to your point, Paula, I think this really raises two questions, right? How is this allowed to happen? Firms are supposed to have checks and balances specifically to prevent this kind of activity. And two, why are we only learning about this now three weeks into September?</p><p>NEWTON: Yes. And such good two points that you bring up there. Before I let you go, did the company mentioned in terms of there must have been a wholesale change in the way their trading happens for them to actually go on? I mean, you said higher than $320 million perhaps.</p><p>EGAN: Right. That's right. They are still -- it sounds like they're still trying to wrap their heads around exactly what happened and how this happened. They said that they closed out the positions, but they are also allowing for the possibility that the losses may be higher.</p><p>[09:55:05]</p><p>EGAN: There's obviously going to also be legal fees involved in this and possibly, you know, forensic activity as well. So we're going to have to check in on this.</p><p>But you know, Paula, this is not the first time we're seeing a rogue trader hurting a financial firm. I mean, you have to remember that last decade, there was that really infamous rogue trader at SocGen, the French bank. That cost the firm a lot of money. It was $6 billion that the bank disclosed in 2008.</p><p>And then if you go back even further, there was another rogue trader that lost $1.3 billion at the U.K. bank, Barings and that ended up contributing to the firm's collapse.</p><p>NEWTON: Yes, and I think -- I'm going to have to leave it there, Matt, I think that's the issue, right? It's like, weren't these lessons learned already? Okay, Matt, have a great weekend. Appreciate it.</p><p>EGAN: Thank you.</p><p>NEWTON: And a quick check on the markets for you as they are picking up a little bit of steam. Not much there, but we'll see, especially as the expirations are coming due.</p><p>That is it for the show. Thanks for watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Paula Newton. \"International Desk\" starts right after a short break.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019092001cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3J-58N1-DXH2-6282-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 20, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

I am Anderson Cooper moderating tonight's debate all along with CNN's Erin Burnett and New York Times national editor Marc Lacey. </p><p>We are in Ohio tonight because it is one of the most critical battleground states. Ohio has backed all but two presidential winners in every election since 1896. </p><p>BURNETT: The top 12 Democratic presidential candidates are at their positions behind the podiums. This is a record number of candidates for a presidential primary debate so to accommodate the large group there are no opening statements tonight. </p><p>LACEY: Before we begin a reminder of the ground rules. You will each receive 75 seconds to answer questions, 45 seconds for responses and rebuttals and 15 seconds for clarifications. Please refrain from interrupting your fellow candidates as that will count against your time. </p><p>COOPER: And we remind our audience here in the right center(SP) at Otterbein to be respectable so the candidates can hear the questions and each other. All right. Let's begin. </p><p>Since the last debate House Democrats have officially launched an impeachment inquiry against President Trump which all of the candidates on the stage support. Senator Warren I want to start with you. You have said that there's already enough evidence for President Trump to be impeached and removed from office but the question is with the election only one year away why shouldn't it be the voters who determines the president's fate? </p><p>WARREN: Because sometimes there are issues that are bigger than politics and I think that is the case with this impeachment inquiry. When I made the decision to run for Pres. I certainly didn't think it was going to be about impeachment but when the Mueller report came out by read it, all 442 pages and when I got to the end I realized that Mueller had shown to a fair the well that this Pres. had obstructed justice and done it repeatedly. And so at that moment I called for opening an impeachment inquiry. </p><p>Now that didn't happen and look what happened as a result. Donald Trump broke the law again in the summer, broke it again this fall. You know we took a constitutional oath and that is that no one is above the law and that includes the President of the United States. Impeachment is the way that we establish that this man will not be permitted to break the law over and over without consequences. This is about Donald Trump but understand it is about the next president. and the next president and the next president and the future of this country. The impeachment must go forward. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. You are all going to get in on this by the way. Senators Sanders do Democrats have any choice but to impeach President Trump? Please respond. </p><p>SANDERS: No, they don't. In my judgment Trump is the most corrupt president in the history of this country. It's not just that he obstructed justice with the Mueller report. I think that the house will find him guilty of worthy of impeachment because of the emoluments clause. This is a president who is enriching himself while using the Oval Office to do that and that is outrageous and I think in terms of the recent Ukrainian incident the idea that we have a President of the United States who is prepared to hold back national security money to one of our allies in order to get dirt on a presidential candidate is beyond comprehension. So I look forward - made by the way not only to a speedy and expeditious impeachment process but Mitch McConnell has got to do the right thing and allow a free and fair trial in the Senate. </p><p>COOPER: Vice President Biden during the Clinton impeachment proceedings you said and I quote the American people don't think that they've made a mistake by electing Bill Clinton and we in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their decision. With the country now split have Democrats been careful enough in pursuing the impeachment of President Trump? </p><p>BIDEN: Yes, they have. I said from the beginning that if in fact Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all of the accusations in the Mueller report, if they did -- </p><p>[*]BIDEN: --that have no choice--no choice but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information. This president, and I agree with Bernie--Senator Sanders, is the most corrupt president in modern history, and I think all of our history. And the fact is that this president of the United States has gone so far as to say, since this latest event, that in fact he will not cooperate in any way at all, will not list any witnesses, will not provide any information, will not do anything to cooperate with the impeachment. They have no choice but to move. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that members of Congress have to be, in her words, fair to the president and give him a chance to exonerate himself. You've already said that, based on everything you've seen, you would vote to remove him from office. Is that being fair to the president? </p><p>HARRIS: Well, it's just being observant because he has committed crimes in plain sight. I mean, it's shocking, but he told us who he was. Maya Angelou told us years ago listen to somebody when they tell you who they are the first time. During that election, Donald Trump he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and get away with it. And he has consistently, since he won, been selling out the American people. He's been selling out working people, he's been selling out our values, he's been selling out national security. And on this issue with Ukraine, he has been selling out our democracy.  </p><p>Our framers imagined this moment, a moment where we would have a corrupt president and our framers then rightly designed our system of democracy to say there will be checks and balances. This is one of those moments, and so Congress must act--act. But the reality of it is that I don't really think this impeachment process is going to take very long because as a former prosecutor I know a confession when I see it and--and he did it in plain sight. He has given us the evidence and he tried to cover it up putting it up in that special server and there's been a clear consciousness of guilt. This will not take very long. Donald Trump needs to be held accountable. He is, indeed, the most corrupt and unpatriotic president we have ever had. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Booker, you have said that President Trump's \"moral vandalism\" disqualifies him from being president. Can you be fair in an impeachment trial? Please respond. </p><p>BOOKER: So first of all, we must be fair. We--we are talking about ongoing proceedings to remove a sitting president for office. This has got to be about patriotism and nonpartisanship. Look, I share the same sense of urgency of everybody on this stage. I understand the outrage that we all feel, but we have to conduct this process in a way that is honorable, that brings our country together, doesn't rip us apart. </p><p>Anybody who has criticisms about a process that is making all the facts bear before the American public, that works to build consensus, that's what this nation needs. And what is a moral moment and not a political one. So I swore an oath to do my job as a senator, do my duty. This president has violated his, I will do mine. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Booker. Senator Klobuchar, you have--what do you say to those who fear that impeachment is a distraction from issues that impact people's day-to-day lives, healthcare, the economy, it could backfire on Democrats? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We can do two things at once. That's our job. We have a constitutional duty to pursue this impeachment. But we also can stand up for America because this president has not been putting America in front of his own personal interest. He has not been standing up for the workers of Ohio, he's not been standing up for the farmers in Iowa. And I take this even a step further. You know, when he made that call to the head of Ukraine, he's digging up dirt on an opponent. That's illegal conduct. That's what he was doing. He didn't talk to him about the Russian invasion, he talked to them about that.  </p><p>So I'm still waiting to find out from him how making that call to the head of Ukraine and trying to get them involved and interfering in our election makes America great again. I'd like to hear from him about how leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter where Russia then steps in to protect them, how that makes America great again. And I would like to hear from him about how coddling up to Vladimir Putin makes America great again. It doesn't make America great again. It makes Russia great again. And that is what this president has done. So whether it is workers issues, whether it is farmers issues, he has put his own private interest-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --and I will not do that. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Secretary Castro, is impeachment a distraction? </p><p>CASTRO: Not at all. We can walk and chew gum at the same time. And all of us are out there everything will day talking about what we're going to do to make sure that more people cross the graduation stage, that more families have great healthcare, the more folks are put to work in places like Ohio where Donald Trump has broken his promises because-- </p><p>[*]CASTRO: --Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania actually, in the latest jobs data, have lost jobs, not gained them. Not only that, what we have to recognize is that not only did the Mueller report point out 10 different instances where the president obstructed justice or tried to, and he made that call to President Zelensky of the Ukraine, but he is ongoingly--in an ongoing way violating his oath of office and abusing his power. </p><p>We have to impeach this president. And the majority of Americans not only support impeachment, they support removal. He should be removed. </p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, you have said that impeachment should be bipartisan. There has been obviously very little Republican support to date, yet Democrats are proceeding. Is that a mistake? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, it's a mistake on the part of Republicans who enable a president whose actions are as offensive to their own supposed values as they are to the values that we all share. Look, the president has left the Congress with no choice. And this is not just about holding the president accountable for not just the things the merging in these investigations, but actions that he has confessed to on television. </p><p>It's also about the presidency itself, because a president 10 years or 100 years from now will look back at this moment and draw the conclusion either that no one is above the law or that a president can get away with anything. But everyone on this stage, by definition, is competing to be a president for after the Trump presidency. </p><p>Remember, one way or the other, this presidency is going to come to an end. I want you to picture what it's going to be like, what is actually going to feel like in this country the first day the sun comes up after Donald Trump has been president. It starts out feeling like a happy thought. This particular brand of chaos and corruption will be over. </p><p>But really think about where we'll be, vulnerable, even more torn apart by politics than we are right now. And these big issues from the economy to climate change have not taken a vacation during the impeachment process. I'm running to be the president who can turn the page and unify a dangerously polarized country while tackling those issues-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --That are going to be just as urgent then as they are now. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Congresswoman Gabbard, you're the only sitting House number on this stage. How do you respond? </p><p>GABBARD: If impeachment is driven by the hyper-partisan interests, it will only further divide an already terribly divided country. Unfortunately, this is what we've already seen play out as calls for impeachment really began shortly after Trump won his election. And as unhappy as that may make us as Democrats, he won that election in 2016. </p><p>The serious issues that have been raised around this phone call that he had with the president of the Ukraine and many other things that transpired around that are what caused me to support the inquiry in the House. And then I think that it should continue to play its course out, together all the information, provide that to the American people, recognizing that that is the only way forward. </p><p>If the House votes to impeach, the Senate does not vote to remove Donald Trump, he walks out and he feels exonerated, further deepening the divides in this country that we cannot afford. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman. Mr. Steyer, you've been calling for impeachment for two years. Does there need to be bipartisan support? </p><p>STEYER: Well, Anderson, this is my first time on this stage, so I just want to start by reminding everybody that every candidate here is more decent, more coherent, and more patriotic than the criminal in the White House. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>But I also want to point out that Anderson's right. Two years ago I started the Need to Impeach movement because I knew there was something desperately wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, that we did have the most corrupt president in the country, and that only the voice and the will of the American people would drag Washington to see it as a matter of right and wrong, not of political expediency. </p><p>So, in fact, impeaching and removing this president is something that the American people are demanding. They are the voice that counts. And that's who I went to, the American people.  </p><p>COOPER: Mr. Yang, do you think there's enough evidence out there to impeach the president? Please respond. </p><p>YANG: I support impeachment, but we shouldn't have any illusions that impeaching Donald Trump will, one, be successful or, two, erase the problems that got him elected in 2016.  </p><p>We're standing in the great state of Ohio, the ultimate purple state, the ultimate bellwether state. Why did Donald Trump when you are state by eight points? Because we got rid of 300,000 manufacturing jobs in your towns.  </p><p>And we are not stopping there. How many of you have noticed stores closing where you work and live here in Ohio? Raise your hands. It's not just you. Amazon alone is closing at-- 30 percent of America's doors and malls, soaking up $20 billion in business while paying zero in taxes. </p><p>These are the problems that got Donald Trump elected, the fourth Industrial Revolution. And that is going to accelerate and grow more serious regardless of who is in the Oval Office. The fact is, Donald Trump, when were talking about him, we are losing. We need to-- </p><p>[*]YANG: (INAUDIBLE) a new vision and that even includes talking about impeaching Donald Trump.  </p><p>COOPER: Mr.--Congressman O'Rourke, on impeachment, please respond.  </p><p>O'ROURKE: You know, I think about everyone who has ever served this country in uniform. We have two examples here on this stage tonight--Mayor Buttigieg and Congresswoman Gabbard. Those who have willingly sacrificed their lives to defend this country and our Constitution. We are the inheritors of their service and their sacrifice and we have a responsibility to be fearless in the face of this President's criminality and his lawlessness.  </p><p>The fact that as a candidate for the highest office in the land he invited the participation, the invasion of a foreign power in our democracy. As President he lied to investigators, obstructed justice, fired James Comey, head of the FBI, tried to fire Mueller, head of the investigation. Then invited President Zelensky to involve himself in our politics as well as China in exchange for favorable trade terms in an upcoming trade deal.  </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, congressman.  </p><p>O'ROURKE: We can not hold him to account if there is not justice, not only have we failed this moment our Constitution and our country we have failed everyone who has sacrificed-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>--and laid their lives down on the line. And we cannot do that.  </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, congressman. The impeachment inquiry is centered on President Trump's attempts to get political dirt from Ukraine on Vice President Biden and his son, Hunter. Mr. Vice President, President Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine. I want to point out, there is no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you. Having said that, on Sunday, you announced that if you're president no one in your family or associated with you will be involved with any foreign businesses.  </p><p>My question is, if it's not okay for a President's family to be involved in foreign businesses--why was it ok for your son when you were Vice President? Vice President Biden?  </p><p>BIDEN: Look, my son did nothing wrong. I did nothing wrong. I carried out the polity of the United States government in rooting our corruption in--in Ukraine. And that's what we should be focusing on.  </p><p>And, what I wanted to make a point about my--my son's statement speaks for himself. He spoke about it today. My son's statement speaks for itself. What I think is important is we focus on why it's so important to remove this man from office.  </p><p>I was--look, the fact that George Washington worried on the first time he spoke after being elected president that what we had to worry about is foreign interference in our elections. It was the greatest threat to America. This President on three occasions, three occasions has invited foreign government and heads of government to get engaged in trying to alter our elections.  </p><p>The fact is that it is outrageous. Rudy Giuliani, the President and his thugs have already proven that they, in fact, are flat lying. What we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump. He doesn't want me to be the candidate, he is going after me because he knows if I get--if I get the nomination I will beat him like a drum.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>COOPER: I'm sorry just to follow-up, Mr. Vice President, as you said, your son, Hunter, today in an interview admitted that he made a mistake and showed poor judgment by serving on the--that board in Ukraine--did you make a mistake by letting him? You were the point person on Ukraine at--at the time. You--you can answer. </p><p>BIDEN: Look, my son's statement speaks for itself. I did my job. I never discussed a single thing with my son on anything having to do with Ukraine. No one has indicated I have. We have always kept everything separate--even when my son was the Attorney General of the State of Delaware we never discussed anything. So, there would be no potential conflict. My son made a judgment. I'm proud of the judgment he made. I'm proud of what he had to say and let's focus on this--the fact of the matter is that this is about Trump's corruption. That's what we should be focusing on.  </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, your response.  </p><p>SANDERS: Let me make a point--I think that it is absolutely imperative to go forward with impeachment. I hope that he is impeached. But I think what would be a disaster if the American people believe that all we were doing is taking on Trump and we are forgetting that 87 million Americans are uninsured or underinsured. We're forgetting about the existential threat of climate change. We are forgetting about the fact that half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.  </p><p>So, what we have got to do is end this corruption, set a precedent for future history that says presidents like this cannot behave this way. But we cannot and must not turn our backs on the pain of the working class of this country.  </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Marc?  </p><p>LACEY: We want to move now to the economy. Senator Warren-- </p><p>SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LACEY: --free public college here. Thank you.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren, we-- </p><p>[*]LACEY: proposed--you have proposed some sweeping plans free public college, free universal childcare, eliminating most Americans college debt and you have said how you are going to pay for those plans but you have not specified how you are going to pay for the most expensive plan, Medicare for all. Will you raise taxes on the middle class for pay--to pay for it, yes or no? </p><p>WARREN: So I have made clear what my principles are here and that is cost will go up for the wealthy and for big corporations and for hard-working middle-class families cost will go down. You know the way I see this is I have been out all around this country, I have done 140 and town halls now, been to 27 states and Puerto Rico, shoot, I've done 70,000 sell fees which must be the new measure of democracy and this gives people a chance to come up and talk to me directly. </p><p>So I've talked with a family, the mom and dad whose daughter has been diagnosed with cancer. I have talked to the young woman whose mother has just been diagnosed with diabetes. I have talked to the young man who has MS. And here's the thing about all of them, they all had great health insurance right at the beginning but then they found out when they really needed it, when they cost went up, that the insurance company pulled the rug out from underneath them and they were left with nothing. </p><p>Look, the way I see this it is hard enough to get a diagnosis that your child has cancer, to think about the changes in your family if you are mom has got diabetes or what it means for your life going forward if you have been diagnosed with MS but what you shouldn't have to worry about is how you are going to pay for your healthcare after that. </p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren to be clear Senators Sanders acknowledges he is going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You have endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too? </p><p>WARREN: So the way I see this in is a about what kinds of cost middle-class families are going to face. So let me being clear on this. Cost will go up for the wealthy, they will go up for big corporations and for middle-class families they will go down. I will not sign a bill into law that does not lower cost for middle-class families. </p><p>LACEY: Mayor Buttigieg you  say Senator Warren has been quote evasive about how she is going to pay for Medicare for All. What is your response? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, we heard it tonight, a yes or no question that didn't get a yes or no answer. Look, this is why people here in the Midwest are so frustrated with Washington in general and capitol Hill in particular. Your signature senator is to have a plan for everything except this. No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in and the thing is we really can deliver healthcare for every American and move forward with the boldest biggest transformation since the inception of Medicare itself but the way to do it without a giant multitrillion dollar hole and without having to avoid a yes or no question is Medicare for all who wanted it. We take a version of Medicare, we let you access it if you want to and if you prefer to stay on your private plan you can do that too. That is what most Americans want. Medicare for All who wanted trusting you to make the right decision for your healthcare and for your family and it can be delivered-- </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mayor. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --without an increase in middle-class taxes. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator, your response? </p><p>WARREN: So let's be clear. Whenever someone hears the term Medicare for all who wanted understand what that really means, it is Medicare for all who can afford it and that is the problem we have got. Medicare for All is the gold standard, it is the way we get health care coverage for every single American including the family whose child has been diagnosed with cancer, including the person who has just gotten an MS diagnosis. That is how we make sure that everyone gets healthcare. We can pay for this, I have laid out the basic principles. Cost are going to go up. For the wealthy they are going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families and I will not sign a bill into law that raises their cost because cost are what people care about. I have been studying this you know for the biggest part of my life-- </p><p>LACEY: Thank--thank you Senator. Can-- </p><p>WARREN: --why people go bankrupt. </p><p>LACEY: Can the mayor respond? </p><p>WARREN: Sure. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I don't think the American people are wrong when they say that what they want is a choice and the choice of Medicare for all who wanted which is affordable for everyone because we make sure that these subsidies are in place allows you to get that healthcare. It's just better than Medicare for all whether you want it or not and I don't understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage to everybody is to obliterate private plans kicking 150 million Americans off of their insurance in four short years when we could achieve that same big bold goal and once again </p><p>[*]BUTTIGIEG: --we have a president that--we are competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized even more than now after everything we've been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided. Why unnecessarily divide this country over healthcare when there is a better way to do deliver coverage for all? </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, mayor. Senator Sanders. </p><p>WARREN: I'd like to be able to respond to this. </p><p>SANDERS: Well as somebody who wrote the damn bill, as I said-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>Let's be clear. Under the Medicare for all bill that I wrote, premiums are gone. Copayments are gone. The deductibles are gone all out-of-pocket expenses are gone. We're going to do better than the Canadians do, and that is what they have managed to do. At the end of the day, the overwhelming majority of people will save money on their healthcare bills. But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge the taxes will go up. They're going to go up significantly for the wealthy. And for virtually everybody, the tax increase they pay will be substantially less, substantially less than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, at least that's a straightforward answer-- </p><p>LACEY: --Senator--Senator Warren-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --but there's a better way-- </p><p>LACEY: --will you acknowledge what the senator just said about taxes going up? </p><p>WARREN: So my view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for a hard-working middle-class families. I will not embrace a plan like Medicare for all who can afford it. That will leave behind millions of people who cannot. And I will not embrace a plan that says people have great insurance right up until you get the diagnosis and the insurance company says sorry, we're not covering your expensive cancer treatments, we're not covering your expensive treatments for MS-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>WARREN: --we're not covering what you need-- </p><p>LACEY: --Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: At least Bernie is being honest here and saying how he's going to pay for this and the taxes are going up. And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice. I believe the best and boldest idea here is to not trash Obamacare but to do exactly what Barack Obama wanted to do from the beginning, and that's have a public option that would bring down the cost of the premium and expand the number of people covered and take on the pharmaceuticals companies. That is what we should do be doing-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--instead of kicking 149 million people off their insurance in four years. And I'm tired of hearing whenever I say these things oh, it's Republican talking points. You are making Republican talking points right now in this room by coming out for a plan is going to do that. I think there is a better way that is bold that will cover more people and it's the one we should get behind. </p><p>LACEY: Senator Warren. </p><p>WARREN: You know, I didn't spend most of my time in Washington. I spent most of my time studying one basic question, and that is why hard-working people go broke. And one of the principal reasons for that is the cost of healthcare. And back when I was studying, two out of every three families that ended up in bankruptcy after a serious medical problem had health insurance. The problem we got right now is the overall cost of healthcare. And look, you can try to spin this any way you want. I've spent my entire life on working on how America's middle class has been hollowed out and how we fight back. I put out nearly 50 plans on how we can fight back and how we can rebuild an America that works. And a part of that is we got to stop-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>WARREN: --Americans from going bankrupt over healthcare costs. </p><p>LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, do you want to respond? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Yes, I do. And I appreciate Elizabeth's work, but again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something the you can actually get done. And we can get this hot public option done and we can take on the pharmaceutical companies and bring down the prices, but what really what really bothers me about this discussion, which we've had so many times is that we don't talk about the things that I'm hearing about from regular Americans. </p><p>That is long-term care. We are seeing--I once called it a silver tsunami, the aging, and then someone told me that was too negative, so I call it the silver surge. The aging of the population great we need to make it easier to get long-term care insurance and strengthen Medicaid. In this state, the State of Ohio that has been hit by the opioid epidemic, we need to take on those Pharma companies and make them pay for the addictions that they have caused and the people that they have killed. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Those are the issues that I hear about when I'm in Toledo, in Cleveland, and Dayton. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you senator. Vice President Biden-- </p><p>HARRIS: --I'd like to be heard-- </p><p>LACEY: --Let--let me--let me bring you in here, vice president. For your response. Are Senators Warren and Sanders being realistic about the difficulty of enacting their plans? </p><p>BIDEN: Well, first of all, the plan we are hearing discussed is that Biden plan, the one I put forward built on Obamacare at a public option. We can go into that. I can talk about that if you'd like. But here's the deal-- </p><p>[*]BIDEN: on the single most important thing facing the American public, I think it's awfully important to be straightforward with them. The plan is going to cost at least $30 trillion over 10 years. That is more on a yearly basis than the entire federal budget. </p><p>And we talk about how we're going to pay for it. The study recently came out showing that in fact it will reduce costs. But for people making between $50,000 and $75,000 a year, their taxes are going to go up about $5,000 because the fact is they'll pay more in new taxes, 7.4 percent plus, or 5 percent, plus a 4 percent income tax. </p><p>If you make a--if a fireman and a schoolteacher are making 100,000 bucks a year, their taxes are going to go up about 10 grand. That is more than they will possibly save on this health care plan. We have a plan put forward--. </p><p>LACEY: --We're coming to you. We're coming-- </p><p>BIDEN: --That will work.  </p><p>LACEY: Senator Sanders, do you want to respond, and then we're coming to you? </p><p>SANDERS: Okay. So, I get a little bit tired, I must say, of people defending a system which is dysfunctional, which is cruel, 87 million uninsured, 30,000 people dying every single year, 500,000 people going bankrupt for one reason. They came down with cancer. </p><p>I will tell you what the issue is here. The issue is whether the Democratic Party has the guts to stand up to the healthcare industry, which made $100 billion in profit, whether we have the guts to stand up to the corrupt price-fixing pharmaceutical industry which is charging us the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>And if we don't have the guts to do that, if all we can do is take their money, we should be ashamed of ourselves.  </p><p>BIDEN: We can stand up to them.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, your response?  </p><p>HARRIS: This is the sixth debate we have had in this presidential cycle, and not nearly one word with all of these discussions about healthcare on women's access to reproductive health care, which is wonderful on attack-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--In America today. And it's outrageous. There are states that have passed laws that will virtually prevent women from having access to reproductive health care. And it is not an exaggeration to say women will die. Poor women, women of color will die because these Republican legislatures in these various states who are out of touch with America are telling women what to do with our bodies. Women are the majority of the population in this country. People need to keep their hands off of women's bodies and let women make the decisions about their own lives. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>HARRIS: And let's talk about-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>HARRIS: --That. That is a significant healthcare issue in America today. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BURNETT: I want to turn onto jobs. According to a recent study, about a quarter of American jobs could be lost to automation in just the next 10 years. Ohio is one of the states likely to be hardest hit. </p><p>Senator Sanders, you say your federal jobs guarantee is part of the answer to the threat from automation, that tens of millions of Americans could end up losing their jobs. Are you promising that you will have a job for every single one of those Americans? </p><p>SANDERS: Damn right we will. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>And I'll tell you why. If you look at what goes on in America today, we have an infrastructure which is collapsing. We could put 15 million people to work rebuilding our roads, our bridges, our water systems, our wastewater plants, airports, etc. </p><p>Furthermore, and I hope we will discuss it at length tonight, this planet faces the greatest threat in its history from climate change. And the Green New Deal that I have advocated will create up to 20 million jobs as we move away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  </p><p>We need workers to do childcare. We need workers--great teachers to come in to school systems which don't have the teachers that we need right now. We need more doctors. We need more dentists. We need more carpenters. We need more sheet metal workers. And when we talk about making public colleges and universities tuition free and canceling student that, we're going to give those people the opportunity to get those good jobs. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Sanders, thank you. Mr. Yang, your main solution to job loss from automation is a universal basic income. Why is giving people $1,000 a month better than Sanders' plan to get--guaranteeing them a job? </p><p>YANG: I am for the spirit of a federal jobs guarantee, but you have to look at how it would actually materialize in practice. What are the jobs? Who manages you? What if you don't like your job? What if you're not good at your job? </p><p>The fact is most Americans do not want to work for the federal government. And saying that that is the vision of the economy of the 21st century to me is not a vision that most Americans would embrace.  </p><p>Also, Senator Sanders' description of a federal jobs guarantee does not take into account the work of people like my wife who is at-- </p><p>[*]YANG: --home with our two boys--one of whom is autistic. We have--we have a freedom dividend of $1,000 a month it actually recognizes the work that is happening in our families and our communities, it helps all Americans transition because the fact is, and you know this in Ohio--if you rely upon the federal government to target its resources you wind up with failed retraining programs and jobs that no one wants.  </p><p>If we put the money into our hands we can build a trickle up economy from our people, our families and our communities up. It will enable us to do the kind of work that we want to do. This is the sort of positive vision in response to the Fourth Industrial Revolution that we have to embrace as a party.  </p><p>BURNET: Senator Book--Senator Booker, a federal jobs guarantee or $1,000 a month? Are those the best solutions there? Please respond.  </p><p>BOOKER: First of all, I'm happy to get in finally and--and I just to say as a great-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--as a great New Jerseyian, Yogi Bera said, I am having deja vu all over again. I'm having deja vu all over again because first of all, I saw this play in 2016's election. We are literally using Donald Trump's lies and the second issue we cover on this stage is elevating a lie and attacking a statesman. That is offensive he should not have to defend ourselves. </p><p>And, the only person sitting at home that was enjoying that was Donald Trump seeing that we are distracting from his malfeasance and that selling out of his office. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I'm having deja vu all over again--and I'm having deja vu all over again because we have another healthcare debate and we aren't talking about the clear and existential threat in America that we're in a state that has had two Planned Parenthood's close. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We are seeing all over this country women's reproductive rights under attack. And God bless Kamala but you know what? Women should not be the only ones taking up this cause and this fight.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And men, it is not just because women are our daughters and our friends and our wives it's because women are people and people deserve to control their own body.  </p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you. We are going to get to that issue later on tonight. Senator Warren, you wrote that blaming job loss on automation is \"A good story except it's not really true\". So, should workers here in Ohio not be worried about losing their jobs to automation?  </p><p>WARREN: So, the data show that we've had a lot of problems with losing jobs. But the principal reason has been bad trade policy. The principal reason has been a bunch of corporations, giant multinational corporations who have been calling the shots on trade. Giant, multinational corporations that have no loyalty to America. They have no loyalty to American workers. They have no loyalty to American consumers. They have no loyalty to American communities. They are loyal only to their own bottom line.  </p><p>I have a plan to fix that. And it's accountable capitalism. It says, you want to have one of the giant corporations in America then by golly, 40 percent of your board of directors should be elected by your employees. That will make a difference when a corporation decides gee, we could save a nickel by moving a job to Mexico when there are people on the board, in the boardroom saying no, do you know what that does to our company? Do you know what that does to our community? To what it does to our workers?  </p><p>We also need to make it easier to join a union and give unions more power when they negotiate.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>We need to restructure strength in this economy and that's where it starts.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, what's your response to Senator Warren's claim that automation is a good story, except it's not really true?  </p><p>CASTRO: Well, I think--I think what folks have said is that that is only part of the issue, right? Well, I believe that we need to address communities that are being impacted by automation. I am even willing to pilot something like UBI and to see how that would work. But I think we need to focus on making sure that we spark job opportunity for people across this country.  </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, here in Ohio in the latest job data, Ohio is losing jobs under Donald Trump. He has broken his promises to Ohio and the industrial Midwest. I would invest in infrastructure to put people back to work. I would invest in a Green New Deal to unleash millions of new jobs in a clean energy economy. I was in Newton, Iowa a few weeks ago and I visited a place called TPI. Newton, Iowa had a Maytag washing machine manufacturing facility and then it closed down. TPI manufactures wind turbines. They are putting hundreds of people to work at decent paying jobs and creating a better future for those families. </p><p>On top of that--let me just say this--we need to support working families. We need to invest in things like universal childcare-- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>--so that people can afford childcare instead of having to pay 20 percent of their income for it.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>YANG: Senator Warren, I've been talking to Americans around the country about automation and they're smart--they see what's happening around them. Their Main Street stores are closing. They see a self-serve kiosk in every McDonald's, every grocery store, every CVS. Driving a truck is the most common job in 29 states including this one. 3.5 million truck drivers in this country and-- </p><p>[*]YANG: my friends in California are piloting self-driving trucks. What is that going to Maine for the 3.5 million truckers or the 7 million of Americans who work in truck stops, hotels and diners that rely upon these truckers getting out having a meal? Saying this is a rules problem is ignoring the reality that Americans see around us every single day. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren respond please. </p><p>UNKNOWN: This is exactly (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>WARREN: I understand that what we are all looking for is how we strengthen America's middle class and actually I think the thing closest to the universal basic income is Social Security. If one of the reasons that I put forward a plan to extend the solvency of Social Security by decades and to add $200 to the payment of every person who receives Social Security right now and every person who receives disability insurance right now. </p><p>That $200 a month will lift nearly 5 million families out of poverty and it will sure loosen up the budget for a whole lot more. It also has a provision for your wife, for those who stay home to do caregiving for children or for seniors and creates an opportunity for them to get credit on their Social Security. So after a lifetime of hard work people are entitled to retire with dignity. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren. </p><p>WARREN: I see this as an important question about I want to understand the data on this. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator thank you very much. </p><p>WARREN: And I want to make sure we are responding to make this work. </p><p>BURNETT: Your time is up. I--I want to give Congresswoman Gabbard a chance to respond. </p><p>GABBARD: Thank you. You know really what this is a about is getting to the heart of the fear that is well-founded. As people look to this automation revolution they look to uncertainty. They don't know how this is going to affect their jobs and their everyday lives and I--I agree with my friend Andrew Yang. I think universal basic income is a good idea to help provide that security so that people can have the freedom to make the kinds of choices that they want to see. </p><p>This has to do with a bad trade deals that we've seen in the past that have also driven fear towards people losing the way that they provide for their families. Really what we need to do is look at how we can best serve the interest of the American people. I do not believe a federal jobs guarantee is the way to do that. The value that someone feels in themselves and their own lives is not defined by the job that they have but is in transiting to who we all are as a Americans whatever we choose to do with our lives and we can't forget that. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you very much. </p><p>One of the industries most at risk from a changing economy is the auto industry. General Motors used to be the largest employer in Ohio, now it is 72nd. Today thousands of GM workers here in Ohio and across the country are on strike. All of you on the stage have voiced support for these workers. Senator Booker one of the latest impasses in negotiations involves bringing jobs back from Mexico. As President how would you convince GM to return production to the United States? </p><p>BOOKER: Well first of all the one point I wanted to make a about the UBI(SP) conversation and I hope that my friend Andrew Yang will come out for this, doing more for workers than UBI would actually be just raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It would put more money in people's pockets than giving them $1000 a month. We have to start putting the dignity back in work and number one you start having trade deals not like this thing that the President is trying to push through Congress right now that gives pharmaceutical companies and other corporations benefits and doesn't put workers at the center of every trade deal. We must make sure we are not giving corporate tax incentives for people to move jobs out of our country but start to put the worker at the center of that and make sure that they have the resources to succeed. But it is more than that. </p><p>I stood with these workers because we are seeing this trend all over our country. I stood with the unions because right now unions in America are under attack. As union membership has gone down we have seen a stratification of wealth and income in this country. So the other thing that I will do as President of the United States is begin to fight again to see union strength in this country spread, to make sure we have sectoral bargaining so that unions from the auto workers all of the way to fast food workers can ensure that we improve workers conditions and make sure that every American has a living wage in this country. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you Senator Congressman O'Rourke same question for you. How would you convince GM to bring production back to the United States from Mexico? </p><p>O'ROURKE: I have met with these members of UAW who are striking outside of facilities in Cincinnati, in Lordstown, Ohio which has just been devastated, decimated by GM and their malfeasance paying effectively zero in taxes last year. The people of Ohio investing tens of millions of dollars in the infrastructure are around there. What they want is a shot and they want fairness in </p><p>[*]O'ROURKE: --how we treat workers in this country, which they are not receiving today. Part of the way to do that is through our trade deals, making sure that if we trade with Mexico, Mexican workers are allowed to join unions, which they are effectively unable to do today. Not only is that bad for the Mexican worker, it puts the American worker at a competitive disadvantage. </p><p>If we complement that with investment in world-class pre-K-12 public education, get behind our world-class public school educators, if we make sure that cost is not an object to be able to attend college, and if we elevate the role of unions in this country and create more than 5 million apprenticeships over the next eight years, we will make sure that every single American has a shot. They don't want to hand out, they don't want a job guarantee, they just want a shot. And as president, I will give them that shot. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, congressman. </p><p>BURNETT: Income inequality is growing in the United States at an alarming rate. The top 1 percent now own more of this nation's wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined. Senator Sanders, when you introduced your wealth tax, which would tax the assets of the wealthiest Americans, you said, quoting you senator, billionaires should not exist. Is it the goal of your plan to tax billionaires out of existence? </p><p>SANDERS: When you have a half a million Americans sleeping out on the street today, when you have 87 people--87 million people uninsured or underinsured, when you have hundreds of thousands of kids who cannot afford to go to college and millions struggling with the oppressive burden of student debt and that you also have three people owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society, that is a moral and economic outrage. </p><p>And the truth is, we cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality and we cannot afford a billionaire class whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years. So if you are asking me do I think we should demand that the wealthy start paying, the wealthiest top one-tenth of 1 percent, start paying their fair share of taxes so we can create that nation and a government that works for all of us, yes, that's exactly what I believe. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, senator. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Mr. Steyer, you are the lone billionaire on this stage. What's your plan for closing the income gap? </p><p>STEYER: Well, first of all, let me say this, Senator Sanders is right. There have been 40 years where corporations have bought this government and those 40 years have meant a forty-year attack on the rights of working people and specifically on organized labor. And the results are as shameful as Senator Sanders says, both in terms of assets and in terms of income. </p><p>It's absolutely wrong, It's absolutely undemocratic and unfair. I was one of the first people on this stage to propose a wealth tax. I would undo every Republican tax cut for rich people and major corporations. But there's something else going on here that is absolutely shameful, and that's the way the money gets split up in terms of earnings.  </p><p>As a result of taking away the rights of working people and organize labor, people haven't had a raise 90 percent of Americans have not had a raise for 40 years. If you took the minimum wage from 1980 and just adjusted for inflation, you get $11. It's $7.25. If you include the productivity gains of American workers, it would be over $20. There something wrong here, and that is that the corporations have bought our government. Our government has failed. That's why I'm running for president because we're not going to get any of the policies that everybody on this stage wants, healthcare, education, Green New Deal-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Mr. Steyer-- </p><p>STEYER: --(INAUDIBLE) or a living wage unless we break the power of these corporations. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Vice President Biden, you have warned against demonizing rich people. Do you believe that Senator Sanders and Senator Warrens wealth tax plans do that? </p><p>BIDEN: No, look, I--demonizing wealth--what I talked about is how you get things done. And the way to get things done is take a look at the tax code right now. The idea--we have to start rewarding work, not just wealth. I would eliminate the capital gains tax that--I would--I would raise the capital gains tax to the highest rate of 39.5 percent. </p><p>I would double it. Because guess what? Why in God's name should someone whose clipping coupons in the stock market make--in fact pay a lower tax rate than someone who in fact is, like I said, the--a schoolteacher and a firefighter? It's ridiculous, and they pay a lower tax. Secondly, the idea that we in fact engage in this notion that there are one point--there's one-- </p><p>[*]BIDEN: --$1 trillion $640 billion in tax loopholes. You can justify a minimum $600 billion of that. We could eliminate it all. I could go into detail had of the time. </p><p>Secondly, the--I mean thirdly, what we need to do is we need to go out and make it clear to the American people that we are going to. We are going to raise taxes on the wealthy. We're going to reduce tax burdens on those who are not.  </p><p>And this is one of the reasons why these debates are kind of crazy, because everybody tries to squeeze everything in to every answer that is given. The fact is that everybody's right about the fact that the fourth Industrial Revolution is costing jobs. It is. The fact is also corporate greed is they're going back and not investing in their employees. They're reinvesting and buying back their stock. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>BIDEN: Because--see, I'm doing the same thing.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Senator Warren, your response? </p><p>WARREN: So, I think this is about our values as a country. Show me your budget, show me your tax plan, and we'll know what your values are.  </p><p>And right now in America, the top one-tenth of one percent have so much wealth, understand this, that if we put a two cent tax on their 50 millionth and first dollar and on every dollar after that, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare for every baby in this country agent zero to five, universal pre-K for every child, raise the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in America, provide for universal tuition free college, but $50 billion and two historically black colleges and universities, and cancel-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Senator Warren-- </p><p>WARREN: --No, let me finish, please. And cancel-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--Student loan debt for 95 percent of the people who have it. </p><p>My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax. It's why is it--does everyone else on the stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans? </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator Warren. </p><p>BIDEN: No one is supporting billionaires.  </p><p>BURNETT: Mayor Buttigieg? Mayor Buttigieg-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --You know-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Your response?  </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm all for a wealth tax. I'm all for just about everything that was just mentioned in these answers. Let me tell you, though, how this looks from the industrial Midwest where I live. </p><p>Washington politicians, Congressman and Senators, saying all the right things, offering the most elegant policy prescriptions, and nothing changes. I didn't even realize it was unusual to have empty factories that I would see out the windows of my dad Chevy Cavalier when he drove me to school. I didn't know that was in every city until I went away to college. </p><p>Now I drive my own Chevy. It's a Chevy Cruze. It used to be built right in Lordstown, which is now one more symbol of the broken promises that this president has made to workers. But why did workers take a chance on this president in the first place? It's because it felt like nobody was willing to actually do anything. </p><p>And while he's unquestionably made it dramatically worse, this is time to realize that we're paying attention to the wrong things. We are paying attention to-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Mayor-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Who sounded better on a-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Debate stage or in a committee hearing-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Senator Klobuchar? Senator Klobuchar-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Versus what it's actually going to take to get something-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Will a wealth tax-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Done-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I want to give a reality check-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Will a wealth tax work? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: It could work. I am open to it. But I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>We just have different approaches. Your idea is not the only idea. And when I look at this, I think about Donald Trump, the guy that, after that tax bill passed, went to Mar-a-Lago, got together with his cronies, and said guess what? You guys all got a lot richer. That was the one time in his presidency he told the truth. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>So, we have different ways. I would repeal significant portions of that tax bill that help the rich, including what he did with the corporate tax rate, including what he did on international taxation. You add it all up, you got a lot of money that, one, helps pay for that childcare, protects the dignity of work, make sure we have decent retirement, and make sure that our kids can go to good schools. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you. Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --It is not one idea-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Senator Klobuchar-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --That rules here.  </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, please respond. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>WARREN: So, understand taxing income is not going to get you where you need to be the way taxing wealth does, that the rich are not like you and me. The-- really, really billionaires are making their money off their accumulated wealth, and it just keeps growing. </p><p>We need a wealth tax in order to make investments in the next generation. Look, I understand that this is hard. But I think as Democrats we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Oh, I would like to respond to that. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Klobuchar, respond please. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: You know, I--I think simply because- </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: --you have different ideas doesn't mean you're fighting for regular people. I wouldn't even be up on this stage if it wasn't for unions and the dignity of work. If my grandpa didn't have unions protecting him in those mines he wouldn't have survived. If my mom didn't have unions as a teacher she wouldn't have been able to make the what(ph)  she made when my parents got divorced.  </p><p>So, just because we have different ideas and get to the same place in terms of beating Donald Trump and taking this on--we are in Ohio. We can win Ohio in the presidency but only if we unite-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--we unite around ideals and don't go fighting against each other and instead take the fight to him.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, you want to give working families a tax credit of up to $6000 a year to help close the income gap.  </p><p>HARRIS: Right.  </p><p>BURNETT: Is that a better solution than the wealth tax?  </p><p>HARRIS: Well, here's how I think about it--when I was growing up my mother raised my sister and me. We would often come home from school before she came home from work. She'd come home, she'd cook dinner and at some point we go to bed and she'd sit up at the kitchen table trying to figure out how to make it all work.  </p><p>And, when I think about where we are right now in 2020 I do believe justice is on the ballot. It's on the ballot in terms of impeachment, it's on the ballot in terms of economic justice, health justice and so many other issues. </p><p>So, when I think about this issue I'm thinking about that dad who tonight is going to be sitting at his kitchen table after everyone has gone to sleep and sitting there with his cup of tea or coffee and trying to figure out how it's going to make--how he's going to make it work. And he's probably sitting there deciding that on that minimum wage job that does not pay enough for him to meet the bills at the end of the month he is going to have to start driving an Uber. </p><p>And what does that mean? That means that with those two jobs he's going to miss his kids' soccer games. That's the reality for Americans today, which is why, yes, when I pass--when I get elected and--and pass this bill which will give the American family which makes less than $100,000 a year a tax credit of up to $6000 a year which they can take home in up to $500 a month--that's going to make a real difference in that man's life.  </p><p>And don't tell him that's not a big deal-- </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, senator.  </p><p>HARRIS: When he's trying to get through to the end of the month.  </p><p>BURNETT: Mr. Yang, your response. Would you impose a wealth tax?  </p><p>YANG: Senator Warren is 100 percent right that we're in the midst of the most extreme winner take all economy in history. And a wealth tax makes a lot of sense in principal. The problem is that it's been tried in Germany, France, Denmark, Sweden and all of those countries ended up repeating it because it had massive implementation problems and did not generate the revenue that they projected. If we can't learn from the failed experiences of other countries what can we learn from?  </p><p>We should not be looking to other country's mistakes instead we should look at what Germany, France, Denmark and Sweden still have which is a value added tax. If we give the American people a tiny slice of ever Amazon sale, every Google search, every robot truck mile, every Facebook ad we can generate hundreds of millions of dollars and then put it into our hands because we know best how to use it.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you. Thank you. Congressman O'Rourke, do you think a wealth tax is the best way to address income inequality, your response?  </p><p>O'ROURKE: I think it's part of the solution but we need to be focus on lifting people up. And sometimes, I think that Senator Warren is more focused on being punitive or pitting some part of the country against the other. Instead of lifting people up and making sure this country comes together around the solutions.  </p><p>I think of a woman that I met in Las Vegas, Nevada. She's working four jobs, raising her child with disabilities and any American with Disabilities knows just how hard it is to make it or get by in this country already. Some of those jobs working for some of these corporations she wants to know how we are going to help you? How we are going to make sure that her child has the care that she needs that we strengthen protections for those with disabilities. That she just has to work one job because it pays a living wage.  </p><p>And, Senator Warren said, show me your budget, show me your tax plan and you'll show me your values. She has yet to describe her tax plan and whether or not that person met would see a tax increase. Under my administration if you make less than $250,000 a year as a family you will not see a tax increase. That family needs to (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>BURNETT: I want to give Senator Warren a chance to respond.  </p><p>WARREN: So, I'm really shocked at the notion that anyone thinks I'm punitive. Look, I don't have a beef with billionaires. My problem is you made a fortune in America, you had a great idea, you got out there and worked for it, good for you. But you built that fortune in America I guarantee you built it in part all of us (INAUDIBLE) to educate. </p><p>You built it in part, getting your goods to market on roads and bridges all of us helped pay for. You built it at least in part protected by police and firefighters all of us helped pay the salaries for. And all I-- </p><p>[*]WARREN: -- in the top 1/10 of 1 percent then pitch in $0.02 so every of their kid in America has the chance to make it. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator thank you. Secretary Castro-- </p><p>WARREN: That is what this is about. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BURNETT: --your response? </p><p>O'ROURKE: (INAUDIBLE) I just want to make sure that we are lifting up those families who are working and need help through and expanded earned income tax credit-- </p><p>WARREN: But that is-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --or child tax credit which we will do in my administration. </p><p>BURNETT: Go ahead senator. </p><p>WARREN: That is the point. This is universal childcare for every baby in this country. Early educational opportunities for every child, universal pre-K no matter where you live for every three-year-old and four-year-old. </p><p>O'ROURKE: but in addition to that-- </p><p>WARREN: -- raising the wages-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: -- will they see a tax increase? </p><p>WARREN: No. Raising the wages of every childcare worker and preschool teacher in this country. This is about universal college, about investments in our HBCUs, about making sure that we get rid of these student loan debt burden-- </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, center. </p><p>O'ROURKE: on this (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>WARREN: -- That is crushing (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you Senator Secretary-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: I just want to note working families are going to see a (INAUDIBLE). </p><p>BURNETT: Secretary Castro--I want to get Secretary Castro in here please Congressman. Go ahead Secretary. </p><p>CASTRO: Thanks a lot, Erin. And you see that everybody has their own plans and let me just say that the way that I view this is borne out of my own experience. I grew up like I bet a lot of folks in this room grew up and folks that are watching on TV. I grew up with my twin brother Joaquin in a single-parent household where my mom was working hard to support us and also her mom, my grandmother and we knew what it was like to wonder whether we were going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month or sometimes have the electricity turned off and when I was a kid to look at the grocery list that seemed to get shorter and shorter and that is what is happening to a lot of families these days. </p><p>I was in Las Vegas a few months ago and I visited people who are homeless who are living in storm drainage tunnels under the Las Vegas strip in the shadow of hotels and casinos that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars where people from around the world are spending so much money on vacations. We can do better than that. </p><p>I believe that a wealth and the quality taxes I proposed is part of the answer but also I proposed an inheritance tax, raising the top marginal tax rate-- </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you Secretary </p><p>CASTRO: --and investing in things like universal childcare and-- </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Booker, please respond. </p><p>CASTRO: --affordable housing. </p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all I just want to respond by--you know we've got one shot to make Donald Trump a one term president then how we talk about each other in this database actually really matters. I--I have had the privilege of working with or being friends with everybody on this stage and tearing each other down because we have a different plan to me is unacceptable. I have seen this script before. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>It didn't work in 2016 and it will be disaster for us in 2020. </p><p>And so I--I have a different plan than Elizabeth Warren, I have a different plan than many people on this stage and it involves a again fair taxes for the richest. We have a lot of work to do there but we have had 20 years of presidential debates and we have never talked about the violence in America of child poverty. We have got to begin to talk more eloquently and more persuasively and urgently about doing the things not just to make sure fair taxes are paid by people on the top but that we deal with the moral obscenity of having the highest levels of child poverty in the industrial world. My plan will focus on that and these are some of the issues we should be talking about, not the finding ourselves just by what we are against but we need to win this election by talking about who and what we are for. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you Senator Booker. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>COOPER: We have got to take a quick break--we've got to take a quick break right now. The CNN New York Times debate fly from Otterbein University in Ohio. We will be right back after this. </p><p>[*]COOPER: And welcome back to the CNN New York Times Democratic--Democratic presidential debate live from Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. I want to turn now to foreign policy. President Trump ordered the withdrawal of all American forces from northern Syria, abandoning America's longtime Kurdish allies. As a result, Turkey has now invaded Syria, ISIS detainees have escaped, and the Kurds have announced a new deal with the government of Damascus, a victory for Syrian Dictator Bashar al-Assad, Russia, and Iran. </p><p>Vice President Biden, we know you would not have withdrawn troops from Northern Syria in this way, but that is already in process, so would you send American troops back into Northern Syria to prevent an ISIS resurgence and protect our Kurdish allies? </p><p>BIDEN: I would not have withdrawn the troops and I would not have withdrawn the additional thousand troops that are in Iraq, which are in retreat now being fired upon by a--Assad's people. And the president of the United States saying if those--if those ISIS folks escape from the prisons therein, though only go to Europe. </p><p>It won't affect us. It has been one of the most shameful thing that I have--that any president has done in modern history, excuse me, in terms of foreign policy. And the fact of the matter is I have never seen a time, and I've spent thousands of hours in the situation room, I spent many hours in the ground of those very places in Syria and Iraq, and guess what? </p><p>Our commanders across the board, former and present are ashamed of what's happening here. What I would do is I would be making it real clear to Assad that in fact, where he's going to have a problem, because Turkey is the real problem here, and I would be having a real lockdown conversation with Erdogan and letting him know that he's going to pay a heavy price for what he has done. Now, pay that price. </p><p>COOPER: Just to clarify, Mr. Vice President, would you want American troops back in Northern Syria? </p><p>BIDEN: I would want those thousand troops to be protected by air cover, those thousand troops that are being--having to withdraw under fire, make it clear that they're not going anywhere, and have them protected and work my way back toward what in fact needs to be done, protecting those Kurds. They lost their lives. This is shameful. Shameful what this man has done. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, last week, you said that American troops should get out of Syria now. You don't agree with how the president handled the withdrawal. What would you have done differently? How would you have pulled out troops without the bloodshed we're seeing now? </p><p>GABBARD: Well, first of all, we've got to understand the reality of the situation there, which is that the slaughter of the Kurds being done by Turkey is yet another negative consequence of the regime change war that we been waiting in Syria. Donald Trump has the blood of the Kurds on his hand, but so do many of the politicians in our country from both parties who have supported this ongoing regime change war in Syria that started in 2011 along with many in the mainstream media who have been championing and cheerleading this regime change war.  </p><p>Not only that, but New York Times and CNN have also smeared veterans like myself for calling for an end to this regime change war. Just two days ago, the New York Times put out an article saying that I'm a Russian asset and an Assad apologist and all these different smears. </p><p>This morning, a CNN commentator said on national television that I'm an asset of Russia. Completely despicable. As president, I will end these regime change wars by doing two things, ending the draconian sanctions that are really a modern day siege, the likes of which we are seeing Saudi Arabia wage against Yemen that have caused tens of thousands of Syrian civilians to die and to starve, and I would make sure that we stop supporting terrorists like al-Qaeda in Syria who've been the ground force in this ongoing regime change war. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>GABBARD: I'd like to ask Senator Warren if she would join me and calling for an end to this regime change or in Syria, finally. </p><p>WARREN: So look, I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. We have to do it the right way, the smart way. What this president has done is that he has sucked up to dictators, he has made impulsive decisions that often his own team doesn't understand, he has cut and run on our allies, and he has enriched himself at the expense of the United States of America. In Syria, he has created a bigger than ever humanitarian crisis, he has helped ISIS get another foothold, a new lease on life. I sit on the armed services committee. I talk with our military leaders-- </p><p>[*]WARREN: about this. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>WARREN: I was in Iraq and went to the neighborhoods that ISIS destroyed. We need to get out-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>WARREN: --But we need to do this through a negotiated solution. There is no-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>WARREN: --Military solution--  </p><p>COOPER: --Mayor Buttigieg-- </p><p>WARREN: --In this region.  </p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, like many of your fellow candidates on the stage, you've been calling for an end to endless wars. What's your response on Syria? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, respectfully, Congresswoman, I think that is dead wrong. The slaughter going on in Syria is not a consequence of American presence. It's a consequence of a withdrawal and a betrayal by this president of American allies and American values. </p><p>Look, I didn't think we should have gone to Iraq in the first place. I think we need to get out of Afghanistan. But it's also the case that a small number of specialized special operations forces and intelligence capabilities were the only thing that stood between that part of Syria and what we're seeing now, which is the beginning of a genocide and the resurgence of ISIS. </p><p>Meanwhile, soldiers in the field are reporting that, for the first time, they feel ashamed, ashamed of what their country has done. We saw the spectacle, the horrifying sight of a woman with the lifeless body of her child in her arms asking what the hell happened to American leadership.  </p><p>And when I was deployed, I knew one of the things keeping my--be safe was the fact that the flag on my shoulder represented a country known to keep its word. And our allies knew it and our enemies lose that. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: You take that away, you are taking away what makes America America.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: It makes our troops and the world a much more dangerous place.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard, your response? </p><p>GABBARD: Yeah, absolutely. And so, really what you're saying, Mayor Pete, is that you would continue to support having U.S. troops in Syria for an indefinite period of time to continue this regime change war that has caused so many refugees to flee Syria, that you would continue to have our country involved in a war that has undermined our national security.  </p><p>You would continue this policy of the U.S. actually providing arms and support to terrorist groups in Syria like Al Qaeda, HTS, Al Nusra, and others because they are the ones who have been the ground for us in this regime change war. That's really what you're saying.  </p><p>COOPER: Mayor Pete? Mayor Buttigieg?  </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: No, you can embrace--or you can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump's policies-- </p><p>GABBARD: --Will you end the regime change war-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --As you are doing-- </p><p>GABBARD: --Is the question--   </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --What we are doing in-- </p><p>GABBARD: --What is an endless war if it's not yet-- </p><p>COOPER: --Allow him to respond, please-- </p><p>GABBARD: --Another regime change war? </p><p>COOPER: Please allow him to respond. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: What we're doing--or what we were doing in Syria was keeping our word. Part of what makes it possible for the United States to get people to put their lives on the line to back us up is the idea that we will back them up to. </p><p>When I was deployed, not just the--the Afghan National Army forces but the janitors put their lives on the line just by working with U.S. forces. I would have a hard time today looking an Afghan civilian or soldier in the eye after what just happened over there. And it is undermining the honor of our soldiers. You take away the honor-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility is in-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Tattered. I will restore U.S. credibility before it is-- </p><p>COOPER: --Senator-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Finally too late.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO? </p><p>SANDERS: I'm sorry. Say that again? </p><p>COOPER: Is Turkey still a U.S. ally? Should they remain in NATO? </p><p>SANDERS: No, Turkey is not a U.S. ally when they invade another country and engage in mass slaughter. The--the crisis here, as I think Joe said and Pete said, is when you begin to betray people.  </p><p>And in terms of the Kurds, 11,000 of them died fighting ISIS, 20,000 were wounded. And the United States said we're with you. We're standing with you. And then suddenly one day, after a phone call with Erdogan announced by tweet, Trump reverses that policy. Now, you tell me what country in the world will trust the word of the president of the United States? In other words, what he has done is wreck our ability to do foreign policy, to do military policy because nobody in the world will believe this pathological liar.  </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: But, this is really important because-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--What this president has done shows that American leadership shapes the behavior of our allies, or sometimes allies too. Remember, the problem right now is not just that--with our competitors, in, for example, a place like China, the people of Hong Kong rise up for democracy and don't get a peep of support from the president.  </p><p>It's not just the behavior of adversaries like Russia, but our one-time allies like Saudi Arabia, which the CIA just concluded was responsible, as we all knew, for murdering and dismembering an American resident and journalist, and Turkey, which was an American ally. That's the point. We have levers, but when we abandon the international stage--     </p><p>[*]BUTTIGIEG: --when we think our only choices are between endless war or total isolation the consequence is-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, mayor. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --the disappearance of U.S. leadership from the world stage. </p><p>COOPER: Senator-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And that makes this entire world a more dangerous place. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar should Turkey remain in NATO? Your response? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: We need to work with our allies to work with Turkey and bring them out. This is an outrageous thing that happened here and I think we need to talk about this not only in terms of the core of what happened here with Turkey but the fact that our president blew it and now he's too proud to say it and what do we do now? We continue that humanitarian aid but then we work with our allies to say come back Turkey and stop this because what Mayor Pete has just said is true. </p><p>Think about our of their allies. Israel, how do they feel right now? Donald Trump is not true to his word when they are a beacon of democracy in the Middle East. Think about our allies in Europe when he pulls out of the Iranian agreement and leaves them holding the bag and gives the power to China and Russia. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, senator </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Think about the nuclear agreement with Russia that he precipitously pulled out of. This is part of a pattern, it is not an isolated incident. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you senator. Senator Harris given that the U.S. abandoned our Kurdish allies what would you do as President to convince the rest of the world that we can still be trusted? </p><p>HARRIS: That's a great question, Anderson, because the commander in chief of the United States of America has as one of her greatest priorities and responsibilities to concern herself with the security of our nation and homeland. </p><p>I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee. I have over a period of time receive classified information about the threats to our security and hotspots around the world. What has happened in Syria is yet again Donald Trump selling folks out and in this case he sold out the Kurds to (INAUDIBLE), fought with bus and thousands died in our fight against ISIS and let's be clear. </p><p>What Donald Trump has done being cause of that phone call with Erdogan is basically giving 10,000 ISIS fighters a get out of jail free card and you know who the winner is in this? There are four Russia, Iran, Assad, and ISIS. This is a crisis of Donald Trump's making and it is on a long list of crises of Donald Trump's making and that is why dude got to go and when I am in commander in chief we will stop this madness. </p><p>COOPER: Secretary Castro, your response? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>CASTRO: Well, I mean you ask the question of how are we going to get people to trust us and again the first thing is we have got to boot Donald Trump out of the Oval Office so that people will trust us again. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>I also want people to think the folks this week that saw those images of ISIS prisoners rounding free. To think about how absurd it is that this President is caging kids on the border and effectively letting ISIS prisoners run free-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>He has made a tremendous mistake, a total disaster there in Syria and just to connect the dots for a second if you are Kim Jong-un for instance why in the world would you believe anything that this president says to contain your nuclear weapons program when he tore up and Iran Nuclear Agreement that we just signed four years ago which was the strongest agreement to contain Iran's nuclear weapons program and now he has abandoned the very people that we gave our word too. I would make sure that we--we work with our allies to pressures Syria to stop the aggression and I support efforts at stronger sanctions than this president has announced. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you Mr. Secretary. </p><p>LACEY: Senator Booker the American intelligence communities says that Russia is trying to capitalize on the power vacuums around the world as we are seeing right now in Northern Syria. What specifically would you do as President to check Vladimir Putin's power on the world stage? </p><p>BOOKER: So first of all understand that this president is turning the moral leadership of this country into a dumpster fire. We--we literally have great generals like Mattis who said on the world stage the United States of America there can be no better friend to the United States of America and no better--make no greater in the me then the United States of America. </p><p>This president has turned that upside down and now is doing things to undermine our critical alliances and partner with Russia. And so clearly to your question number one we cannot allow the Russians to continue to grow in influence by abandoning the world stage. We cannot allow Russia to not only interfere in the democracies of the Ukraine and Lafayette and Lithuania but even not calling them out for their efforts to interfere in this democracy are unacceptable. </p><p>Russia and Putin understand strength and this president time and time again is showing moral weakness. He makes promises to the American people that he's going to protect this nation. Well, instead of doing something to defeat ISIS he has now given them a foothold again. This is an American president that even right now is lying to the American public and saying he is bringing our troops home at the same time he is increasing troop presence with-- </p><p>[*]BOOKER: and while they're involved in an unjust war that is killing 10s of thousands of children in Yemen. This President is making us less safe. He is partnering more with Putin than he is with Merkel and Macron And as my--as President of the United States I will stop this and restore American integrity abroad.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Vice President?  </p><p>BIDEN: I think I may be done making any better (INAUDIBLE) maybe the only person who spent extensive time alone with Putin as well as with Erdogan. And Erdogan understands that when you talk about should you stay in or out of NATO? He understands if he's out of NATO he's in real trouble. But the fact of the matter is we have been unwilling in this Administration because we have an erratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And operates out of fear for his own re-election. What--think what's happened. The fact of the matter is you have Russia influencing and trying to break up NATO. What does the President do? He said, I believe Vladimir Putin. I believe Vladimir Putin. I don't believe our justice committee.  </p><p>SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE) Vladimir Putin now.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>BIDEN: No, no. But here, look here's the deal think what that did. He turns around and he questions whether or not he will keep the sacred commitment of Article 5 for the NATO members. If he is re-elected I promise you there will be no NATO our security will be vastly underrated, under--we will be in real trouble. And with regard to regime change in Syria--that has not been the policy to change the regime. It has been to make sure that the regime did not wipe out hundreds of thousands of innocent people between there and the--and--and Iraqi border.  </p><p>And lastly, and I apologize for going on. But lastly, what is happening in Iraq is going to--excuse me, in Afghanistan, as well as all the way over to Syria. We have ISIS that's going to come here they are going to in fact, damage the United States of America. That's why we got involved in the first place and not ceded the whole area to Assad and to the Russians.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Congressman O'Rourke, Senate Democrats put out a report last year on Russia's hostile actions around the world. They suggest the next president could fight back by publicly revealing what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption and work with allies to freeze his bank accounts. Would you take either of those actions even in the face of possible retaliation?  </p><p>O'ROURKE: Yes. We must be unafraid in ensuring that we hold Russia accountable for invading the world's greatest democracy. And being able to do it--thanks to Donald Trump--functionally with impunity so far, so much so that they are invading this democracy right now, as we speak, still at the invitation of this president.  </p><p>So, if there are not consequences we will continue to see this problem going forward. But in addition (INAUDIBLE) to answer the previous question that you asked--how do we stand up to Russia on the global stage? We do that by renewing our alliances and our friendships that is what makes America stronger. There isn't enough money in this country. There aren't enough service members as brave and courageous as they are to do everything that we want to accomplish militarily around the world and the Kurds are case in point.  </p><p>In fact, because we turned our backs on them those Kurds who fought for us in Syria helped to defeat ISIS not just for themselves but for the United States of America, it makes it more likely that we have to send another generation of service members to fight those battles there. And then lastly, as General Mattis, who was invoked earlier has said, we have two powers--one of intimidation and one of inspiration. We need to now focus on that latter power and make sure that we invest in diplomacy, in our State Department and peacefully and non-violently resolving our foreign policy goals. Not on the backs of 18 and 19 and 20 year olds anymore but making sure that our diplomats are invested in, have the focus necessary by this next president to make sure that they can accomplish those goals for this country and for the world.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Congressman.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Mr. Steyer, would you publicly reveal what the U.S. knows about Putin's corruption or work to freeze his bank accounts, please respond.  </p><p>STEYER: Absolutely. As far as I'm concerned, Mr. Trump's America First program which involves having no plans, having no process and having no partners has proved to be a disaster in Syria, it has proved to be a disaster in terms of our response to Russia's attacking our democracy.  </p><p>And more than that--when we look at the problems around the world the idea that the United States is going to act unilaterally against the country without the support of our traditional allies makes absolutely no sense. Let's go to the most important international problem that we're facing which no one has brought up which is climate.  </p><p>We can't solve the climate crisis in the United States by ourselves. It's an international crisis. I've been working on it for 10 years taking on the corporations but we have to work with our allies and our frenemies around the world.  </p><p>[*]STEYER: If you look at what Mr. Trump is doing, of course he's been bought by the oil and gas companies. But any problem we're going to do, but specifically climate, we're going to have to lead the world morally, were going to have deleted technologically, financially, and commercially. This is the proof that this kind of America first go it alone trust nobody and be untrustworthy is the worst idea I've ever heard, and I would change it on day one in every single way. </p><p>LACEY: Mr. Yang, your response to Putin and Russia? </p><p>YANG: Of course. We have to look at the chain of events. How did we get here? The fact is we were falling apart at home, so we voted in Donald Trump and he is now led us down this dangerous path with erratic and unreliable foreign policy. We have to let Russia know, look, we get it, we tampered with other elections, you've tempered with our elections, and now it has to stop. And if it does not stop, we will take this as an act of hostility against the American people. I believe most Americans would support me on this.  </p><p>But Russian hacking of our democracy is an illustration of the two first century threats. Artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, climate change, loose nuclear material, military drones, and nonstate actors. These are the threats they're going to require our administration to catch up in terms of technology. We all know we are decades behind the curve on technology. We saw when Mark Zuckerberg testified at Congress the nature of the questioning. As commander-in-chief, I will help pull us forward-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I want to respond-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you Mr. Yang-- </p><p>YANG: --And that's going to be a key response ability of the next president. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I want to respond to Mr. Yang. I don't see a moral equivalent equivalency between our country and Russia. Vladimir Putin is someone who has shut down planes over Ukraine, who has poisoned his opponent, and we have not talked about what we need to do to protect ourselves from Russia invading our election. This wasn't meddling. That's what I do when I call my daughter on a Saturday night and ask her what she's doing. Sorry. </p><p>UNKNOWN: He has no soul. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: This was much more serious than that. This was actually invading our elections. So protect ourself in 2020, what we need, one, backup paper ballots in every single state. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>That is the bill that I lead and we need to stop Mitch McConnell from stopping that from happening, and then we need to stop these social media companies from running paid political ads, including ones last time in rubles without having to say where those ads came from and who paid for them. That's the honest ads act, that's a bipartisan bill that I lead, and we can't wait-- </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --to become president to get that done. We need to get it done now. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. We want to turn back to domestic issues and the epidemic of gun violence in this country. Were less than 100 miles from Dayton Ohio where two months ago a gunman killed nine people using an AR-15 style weapon with a high-capacity magazine. Congressman O'Rourke. </p><p>In the last debate you said \"Hell yes, we're going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\" but when you asked how you would enforce mandatory buyback, you said police wouldn't be going door to door. So how exactly are you going to force people to give up their weapons? You don't even know who has those weapons. </p><p>O'ROURKE: Look, we're going to make sure that the priority is saving the lives of our fellow Americans. I think almost everyone on this stage agrees that it's not right, and as president would seek to ban the sale of AR-15's and AK-47s. Those are weapons of war. They were designed to kill people effectively, efficiently on a battlefield. You mentioned the massacre in Dayton. 9 people killed in under 40 seconds. In El Paso, Texas, 22 were killed under 3 minutes. And the list goes on throughout the country.  </p><p>So if the logic begins with those weapons being too dangerous to sell, then it must continue by acknowledging with 16 million AR-15's and AK-47s out there, they're also too dangerous to own. Every single one of them is a potential instrument of terror. Just ask Hispanics in Texas. Univision (SP) surveyed them. More than 80 percent feared that they would be a victim of a mass terror attack like the one in El Paso that was targeted at Mexican Americans and immigrants inspired in part by this president's racism and hatred that he's directed at communities like mine in El Paso. </p><p>So I expect my fellow Americans to follow the law the same way that we enforce any provision, any law that we have right now. We don't go door-to-door to do anything in this country to enforce the law. I expect Republicans, Democrats, gun owners, non-gun owners alike to respect and follow the law. </p><p>COOPER: Congressman, let me follow-up. Just to follow-up, your expectations aside, your website says you will find people who don't give up their weapons. That doesn't take those weapons off the streets. So to be clear, exactly how are you going to take away weapons from people who do not want to get them up and you don't know where they are? </p><p>O'ROURKE: If someone does not turn in an AR-15 or an AK-47, one of these weapons of war or brings it out in public and brandishes it in an attempt to intimidate, as we saw when we were at Kent State recently, then that weapon will be taken from them. If they persist, there will be other consequences from-- </p><p>[*]O'ROURKE: law enforcement. But the expectation is that Americans will follow the law. I believe in this country. I believe in my fellow Americans. I believe that they will do the right thing. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Mr.--Mayor Buttigieg, just yesterday you referred to mandatory buybacks as confiscation, and said that Congressman O'Rourke has been picking a fight to try to stay relevant. Your response on guns? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, as Congressman--Congressman, you just made it clear that you don't know how this is actually going to take weapons off the streets. If you can develop a plan further, I think we can have a debate about it. But we can't wait. People are dying in the streets right now.  </p><p>We can't wait for universal background checks that we finally have a shot to actually get through. We can't wait to ban the sale of new weapons and high-capacity magazines so we don't wind up with millions more of these things on the street.  </p><p>We can't wait for red flag laws that are going to disarm domestic abusers and prevent suicides, which are not being talked about nearly enough as a huge part of the gun violence epidemic in this country. We cannot wait for purity tests. We have to just get something done. </p><p>COOPER: Mr.--Congressman-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --This--this is not a purity test-- </p><p>COOPER: --O'Rourke, your response. </p><p>O'ROURKE: This is--this is a country that loses 40,000 of our fellow Americans every year to gun violence. This is a crisis and we've got to do something about it. And those challenges that you describe are not mutually exclusive to the challenges that I'm describing. </p><p>I want to make sure that we have universal background checks and red flag laws and that we in the sale of these weapons of war. But to use the analogy of healthcare, it would be as though we said, look, we're--we're for primary care, but let's not talk about mental health care because that's a dash make a bridge too far. People need that primary care now, so let's save that for another day. </p><p>No, let's decide what we are going to believe in, what we are going to achieve, and then let's bring this country together in order to do that. Listening to my fellow Americans, to those moms who demand action, to those students who marched for our lives, who in fact came up with this extraordinary, bold peace plan-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, Congressman-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --That calls for mandatory buybacks, let's follow their inspiration and lead and not be limited by the polls and the consultants and the focus groups. Let's do what's right while-- </p><p>COOPER: --Mayor Buttigieg, your response-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --We have time to do what's right.  </p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg?  </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: The problem isn't the polls. The problem is the policy. And I don't need lessons from you on courage, political or personal.  </p><p>Everyone on this stage is determined to get something done. Everyone on this stage recognizes, or at least I thought we did, that the problem is not other Democrats who don't agree with your particular idea of how to handle this. The problem is the National Rival Association and their enablers in Congress, and we should be united in taking the fight to them. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>O'ROURKE: That's--that's--that's a mischaracterization. Anderson, I've got to answer this.  </p><p>I never took you or anyone else on disagrees with me on this issue. But when you, Mayor Buttigieg, describe this policy as a shiny object, I don't care what that meant to me or my candidacy.  </p><p>But to those who have survived gun violence, those who've lost a loved one to an AR-15, an AK-47, March for Our Lives formed in the courage of students willing to stand up to the NRA and conventional politics and poll tested politicians, that was a slap in the face to every single one of those groups and every single survivor of a mass casualty assault with an AR-15 and an AK-47. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Thank you. </p><p>O'ROURKE: We must buy them back.  </p><p>COOPER: Congressman, thank-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --What we owe to those survivors is to actually deliver a solution. I'm glad you offered up that analogy-- </p><p>COOPER: --All right-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --To healthcare, because this is really important. We are at the cusp of building a new American majority to actually do things that congressman and senators have been talking about with almost no impact for my entire-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, Mayor-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Adult life. No, we--this is really important, okay? On--on guns, we are this close to an assault weapons ban. That would be huge. And we're going to get wrapped around the axle in a debate over whether it's hell yes we're going to take your guns? We have an opportunity to-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, Mayor-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Deliver healthcare-- </p><p>COOPER: --Your time is up-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --To everybody. And some on this stage are saying it doesn't count unless we obliterate-- </p><p>COOPER: --Senator Booker-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Our rivals-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --(INAUDIBLE) time that we have time to do-- </p><p>COOPER: --Want to give somebody--I want to give other-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --Right now. That's what I'm saying-- </p><p>COOPER: --I want to give other candidates a--a chance. Senator Booker, what your response to--to Mayor Buttigieg?  </p><p>BOOKER: Well, look, I--I again worry about how we talk to each other and about each other and what this last week has shown.  </p><p>There's a young man in my neighborhood--I watched him grow up. I lived in some high rise projects with him--named Shahad (PH). He was murdered on my block last year with an assault rifle. I'm living with a sense of urgency on this problem because when I go home to my community, like millions of Americans, we live in communities where these weapons, where these gunshots are real every single day. </p><p>And I know where the American public is. This is not about leadership. This is why, when I talk about things like gun licensing and point out the differences between us, I'm not attacking people or their character or their courage on these issues. We all have courage, but it's frustrating that when the American people, 77 percent of Americans, agree on licensing. We don't need leadership right now. We just need folks that are going to stand up and follow where the people already are-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>BOOKER: --Because there are millions of Americans where this is a daily nightmare, where we're surrendering our freedoms-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>BOOKER: --To fear in this country. This is the first time in American history, this fall, where we have sent our children to school, the strongest nation on the planet Earth, and said to them we can't protect you. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>BOOKER: So, in school we're going to teach you how to hide. There are more duck and cover drills and shelter in place drills in America now than fire drills.  </p><p>[*]COOPER: Thank you, senator </p><p>BOOKER: If I am president of the United States I will bring an urgency to this issue and make sure-- </p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar-- </p><p>BOOKER: --that we and the scourge of--of mass violence in our country. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar, Senator Warren, Senator Warren supports a voluntary--excuse me, Senator--Senator Klobuchar you support a--a voluntary buyback if I'm correct, right. What is wrong with a mandatory buyback your response? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I just keep thinking of how close we are to finally getting something done on this. I am looking at the mayor of Dayton. I met one of the survivors from that shooting 30 seconds nine people killed. The public is with us on this in a big way. The majority of Trump voters want to see universal background checks right now. </p><p>The majority of hunters want to see us move forward with gun safety legislation. There are three bills right now on Mitch McConnell's desk, the background check bill, my bill to close the boyfriend loophole so domestic abusers don't get guns, the build to make it easier for police to vet people before they get a gun. </p><p>That is what we should be focusing on and I just don't want to screw this up. When I am president I do want to bring in an assault weapon ban and I do want to put a limitation on magazine so what happened in Dayton Ohio will never happen again but let's not mess this up with this fight. </p><p>COOPER: Senator--Senator Warren use support a voluntary gun buyback of assault style weapons as well. Why not a mandatory one? </p><p>WARREN: So look I want to get what works done. I want to use the method we used for example with machine guns. We registered them, we put in a huge penalty if you didn't register them and a huge tax on them and let people turn them in and it got machine guns out of the hands of people. But the problem here that we need to focus on is first how widespread gun violence is. As you have rightly identified it's not just about mass shooting. It's what happens in neighborhoods all across this country. It is about suicide, it is a about domestic violence. This is not going to be a one and done that we do one thing or two things or three things and then we are done. We have to reduce gun violence overall and the question we have to ask is why hasn't it happened. You say we are so close. We have been so close. I stood in the United States Senate in 2013-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>WARREN: --when 54 senators voted in favor of gun legislation-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, senator </p><p>WARREN: --and it didn't pass because of the filibuster. </p><p>COOPER: Senator? </p><p>WARREN: We have got to attack the corruption and repeal the filibusters-- </p><p>COOPER: Senator Harris? </p><p>WARREN: --or the gun industry will always have a veto over what happens. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Harris talk--you disagree with Senator Warren. You think the buyback should be mandatory. Please respond. </p><p>HARRIS: Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate eight people will die from gun violence. The leading cause of death of young black men in America is gun violence, more than the top of their six reasons totaled. </p><p>This is a serious matter. I have personally hugged more mothers of homicide victims than I care to tell you. I have looked at more autopsy photographs than I care to tell you. I have attended more police officer funerals than I care to tell you. </p><p>I am done and we need action and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I am elected I will give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don't I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check require meant and banned the importation of assault weapons into our country because it is time to act. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Biden--Vice President Biden, your response? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>BIDEN: I am the only one on this stage who has taken on the NRA and beat them and beat them twice. We were able to get assault weapons off the streets and not be able to be sold for 10 years. Recent studies show that mass violence went down when that occurred. </p><p>The way to deal with those guns and those-- the AR-15s and the assault weapons that are on the street--were not on the street, that people own is to do what we do in the national firearms act as it related to machine guns. You must register that weapon, you must register it. When you register it, the likelihood of it being used diminishes exponentially. </p><p>I am the only one that got moved to make sure that we could not have a magazine that had more than 10 rounds and it. I have done this, I know how to get it done. If you really want to get it done go after the gun manufacturers and take back the exemption they have of not being able to be sued. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>COOPER: Thank you Mr. Vice President. Secretary Castro, the vast majority of homicides committed with a gun in this country are from handguns not assault style weapons. What is your-- </p><p>[*]COOPER: plan to prevent those deaths?  </p><p>CASTRO: Thank you very much for the question. You know, I grew up in neighborhoods where it wasn't uncommon to hear gunshots at night. And, I can remember ducking into the backseat of a car when I was a freshman in high school across the street from my school, a public school because folks were shooting at each other.  </p><p>In the neighborhoods though--let me answer this question about voluntary versus mandatory. There are two problems I have with mandatory buy backs--number one, folks can't define it. And, if you're not going door--door to door then it's not really mandatory. But also in the--in the places that I grew up in we weren't exactly looking for another reason for cops to come banging on the door. And y'all saw a couple of days ago what happened to Tatiana Jefferson in Fort Worth.  </p><p>A cop showed up sat 2:00 in the morning at her house when she was playing video games with her neph--with her nephew, he didn't even announce himself and within four seconds he shot her and killed her through her own window. She was in her own home. And so, I'm not going to give these police officers another reason to go door to door in certain communities because policy violence is also gun violence and we need to address that.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>COOPER: Senator Castro, thank you.  </p><p>LACEY: Turning to another key issue here in Ohio and around the country the opioid epidemic. Senator Klobuchar, CNN reached out to Ohio democratic voters for their most pressing questions, Bree (PH), a teacher in Proctorville, asks--In rural Ohio the opioid epidemic has affected our communities and schools. I have many high school students who have lost one or both parents to heroin. Teachers are on the front lines daily witnessing these tragedies. How will you tackle this problem in general? But specifically, what will you offer people in rural communities where rehabilitation is not easily accessed and access to jobs is difficult?  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Well, I want to thank her for this question. This is something that should have never have happened to begin with. I remember when I was a prosecutor these were not the kind of cases that were coming in our door. And it's gotten worse and worse and we now know why. As the evidence is coming out of those lawsuits probably one of the most horrible things that I saw, was the email from one of the pharma executives that actually said, \"Keep pumping them out. They're eating them like Doritos.\"  </p><p>So, my first answer to that question and which is include din my plan, is that the people that should pay for this, that should pay for the treatment are the very people that got people hooked and killed them in the first place. And that is the people that are manufacturing these opioids. That's the first way.  </p><p>And you can, with a two cents per milligram tax bring in the money plus with the federal master settlement to help--in rural areas where they are so isolated and also in urban areas where it's by the way--not just opioids. There's still meth issues and crack/cocaine issues.  </p><p>This is personal for me. My dad he struggled with alcoholism his whole life and by this third DWI he said to him, the prosecutor--you got to face jail or you got to go to treatment. He picked treatment and he was pursued by grace. And he has been sober ever since. And now he's 91 and in assisted living and he said to me last year, it's hard to get a drink around here anyway.  </p><p>But he still has an AA group that visits him there. So, for me, I believe that everyone in this country including the people in rural America have that same right to be pursued by grace.  </p><p>BOOKER: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Steyer, how would you address the opioid epidemic that exists here in Ohio and around the country? Please respond.  </p><p>STEYER: Well, I think this is one of the most heartbreaking experiences that America has had. 72,000 people died of opioid overdoses last year. And that's not only a tragedy for them. It's a tragedy for their families in their communities. And so, I think we have to treat this as a health crisis. We have to move the resources and the support there to try and help people.  </p><p>But I think that Senator Klobuchar makes a good point. The reason I'm running for president is that we have a broken government and we have a broken government because corporations have bought it in every single one of these conversations is about that broken government. It's about drug companies buying the government and getting what they want. It's about the gun manufacturers buying the government and get what we want. We need to break the corporate stranglehold on our government. I've put forward actual structural changes including term limits, a national referendum, the end to the idea that corporations are people and have the rights of American citizens politically and make it a lot easier to vote.  </p><p>These corporations have taken over our government and 72,000 deaths last year -- are the tragic results.  </p><p>LACEY: Mr. Yang, you want to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of opioids including heroin. How would that solve the crisis?  </p><p>YANG: That's exact right and we have to-- </p><p>[*]YANG: --recognize this is a disease of capitalism run amok. There was a point when there were more opiate prescriptions in the State of Ohio than human beings in the State of Ohio. And for some reason, the federal government thought that was appropriate. They ended up levying a $600 million fine against Purdue Pharma, which sounds like a lot of money until you realize that company made $30 billion. They got a 2 percent fine and they killed tens of thousands of Americans, eight an hour.  </p><p>So if the government turned a blind eye to this company spreading a plague among its people, then the least we can do is put the resources to work in our communities so our people have a fighting chance to get well, even though this is not a money problem. We all know this is a human problem. And part of helping people get the treatment that they need is to let them know that they're not going to be referred to a prison cell, they will be part referred to treatment and counseling.  </p><p>I talked to an EMT in New Hampshire and he said he saves the same addicts over and over again because the fact is after you save someone whose OD-ing, you just bring them back to the their house and the OD again the following week. So we need to decriminalize opiates for personal use. We have to let the country know this is not a personal failing, this was a systemic government failing, and then we need to open up safe consumption and safe injection sites around the country because they save lives. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Yang. Congressman O'Rourke, is decriminalizing opioids part of the solution? Please respond. </p><p>O'ROURKE: Yes, it is for many of the reasons that Mr. Yang just described. And also, just from some personal experience I've had as a member of Congress were constituents of mine have come forward, in some cases publicly at a town hall meeting to describe their addictions, I remember a veteran telling me that he bought heroin off the street because he was originally prescribed an opioid at the VA. </p><p>Now, imagine if that veteran, instead of being prescribed an opioid, had been prescribed marijuana because we made that legal in America, insured the VA could prescribe it, expunge the arrest records for those who been arrested for possession, and made sure that he was not prescribed something to which he would become addicted.  </p><p>I also want to agree with Senator Klobuchar. Until we hold those responsible accountable for their actions, Purdue Pharma, Johnson &amp; Johnson, we're going to continue to have this problem going on again. So that veteran that I met and anyone with drug addiction today is not a problem for the criminal justice system, there an opportunity for our public health system in America. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, congressman. Senator Harris, you want to hold the drug manufacturers that fueled the crisis accountable. Are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to jail? </p><p>HARRIS: I am. And I will tell you as a former prosecutor, I do think of this as being a matter of justice and accountability because they are nothing more than some high-level dope dealers. They have been engaged-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>They have--and I've seen it happen before. I've taken on the pharmaceutical companies when I was Attorney General of California and led the second largest Department of Justice. I've seen what they do. The biggest pharmaceutical companies, the eight biggest pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies last year profited $72 billion on the backs of people like the families that we are talking about that have been overwhelmed by this crisis, which is a public health epidemic. </p><p>And they knew what they were doing. They were marketing falls advertising. They knew what they were pushing and communities and states like Ohio without any concern about that repercussions because they were profiting and making big bucks.  </p><p>And yes, they should be held accountable. This is a matter of justice. And so as president of the United States, I would ensure that the United States Department of Justice understand that you want to deal with who is really a criminal, let's and mass incarceration and end that failed war on drugs and let's go over--after these pharmaceutical companies for what they been doing to destroy our country in states like Ohio. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, senator.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Secretary Castro, are you in favor of sending those drug company executives to prison? Please respond. </p><p>CASTRO: Yes, I am. They need to be held accountable not only financially, but also criminal penalties. And you know, you can draw a straight line between making sure that we hold executives accountable, whether it's these drug manufacturers or Wall Street executives that should have been held accountable a decade and half ago. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you.  </p><p>BURNETT: Now to the issue of candidates and their health. Senator Sanders, I want to start with you-- </p><p>SANDERS: (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>BURNETT: --I want to start--were moving on, Senator. I'm sorry. </p><p>SANDERS: I'm healthy. And feeling great. But I would like to respond to that question. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>BURNETT: I want to--I want to start by saying-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BOOKER: And Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana. I want to make sure that's clear as well. </p><p>SANDERS: Thank you. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Sanders, this debate-- </p><p>SANDERS: --I'm not on it tonight-- </p><p>BURNETT: --does mark your--this debate-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>SANDERS: All right, let me-- </p><p>BURNETT: --This debate, sir, does mark your return to the campaign trail. Okay, go on with your point and then I'll ask my question, senator. </p><p>SANDERS: I--I'm more than happy to answer your question, but I wanted to pick up on what Kamala and Corey and others have said. Let's take a deep breath, take a look at this opioid epidemic. </p><p>[*]SANDERS: You have executives, CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies, making tens of millions of dollars a year. And in this particular case with the opioids, they knew that they were selling a product to communities all over this country which were addicting people and killing them. And last year, the top 10 drug companies made $69 billion in profit. </p><p>This is what unfettered capitalism is doing to this country. And it's not just the drug companies. Right now the CEOs in the fossil fuel industry know full well that their product is destroying this world and they continue to make huge profits. </p><p>BURNETT: All right. Senator-- </p><p>SANDERS: --That is why we need a political revolution that says-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>SANDERS: --Enough is enough to this behavior. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BURNETT: Senator, we are all very glad you're feeling well-- </p><p>SANDERS: --Thank you-- </p><p>BURNETT: --As you just said. But--but there is a question on a lot of people's minds, and I want to address it tonight. You're 78 years old and you just had a heart attack. How do you reassure Democratic voters that you're up to the stress of the presidency? </p><p>SANDERS: Well, let me invite you all to a major rally we're having in Queens, New York, BernieSanders.com. We're going to have a special guest at that event, and we're going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people. </p><p>But let me take this moment, if I might, to thank so many people from all over this country, including many of my colleagues up here, for their love, for their prayers, for their well wishes. And I just want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and I'm so happy to be back here with you this evening. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BURNETT: Vice President Biden, if you're elected, you will turn 80 during your first term. Last month, former president Jimmy Carter said he could not have undertaken the duties of the presidency at 80 years old. Why are you so sure that you can? </p><p>BIDEN: Because I've watched it. I know what the job is. I've been engaged. Look, one of the reasons I am running is because of my age and my experience. With it comes wisdom. We need someone to take office this time around who on day one can stand on the world stage, command the respect of world leaders from Putin to our allies, and know exactly what has to be done to get this country back on track. </p><p>It is required now more than any time in any of our lifetimes to have someone who has that capacity on day one. That's one of the reasons why I decided to run, why decided to run this time, because of--I know what has to be done. I've done it before.  </p><p>I've been there when we pulled the nation out of the worst financial recession in history. I've been there and I've got so many pieces of legislation passed, including the Affordable Care Act, as well as making sure that we had the Recovery Act, which kept us from going into a depression. </p><p>I know what has to be done. I will not need any on the job training the day I take office. And I will release-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--My medical records, as I have 21 years of my tax records, which no one else on this stage has done, so you can have full transparency as to my health and what I am doing. </p><p>BURNETT: Just to be clear, Mr. Vice President, when will you release those records? </p><p>BIDEN: Before the first vote. </p><p>BURNETT: Before the Iowa? </p><p>BIDEN: Yes.  </p><p>BURNETT: Not by the end of this year? </p><p>BIDEN: Well, before Iowa. I mean, look, I release them before. I mean-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--I released 55 pages of mine. I'm the only guy that's released anything up here. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, like Senator Sanders and Vice President Biden, if you win the presidency, you would be the oldest president ever inaugurated in a first term. You would be 71. 40 percent of Democratic primary voters say they think a candidate under the age of 70 is more likely to defeat President Trump. What do you say to them? </p><p>WARREN: Well, I say I will outwork, out organize, and outlast anyone, and that includes Donald Trump, Mike Pence, with whoever the Republicans get stuck with. Look-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>--The--the way I see this, the way we're going to win is by addressing that on what millions of Americans know in their bones. And that is that the wealthy and the well-connected have captured our democracy, and they're making it work for themselves and leaving everyone else behind. </p><p>And political pundits and Washington insiders and, shoot, people in our own party don't want to admit that. They think that running some kind of vague campaign that nibbles around the edges of a big problems in this country is a winning strategy. </p><p>They are wrong. If all Democrats can promise is after Donald Trump it will be business as usual then we will lose. Democrats win when we call out what is broken and we show how to fix it. Democrats will win when we fight for the things that touch people's lives. Things like childcare and health care and housing cost. Democrats will win when we give people a reason to get in a fight. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you Senator Warren. Congresswoman Gabbard, you are 38 years old and you would be the youngest President if elected. Should age matter when choosing a President? </p><p>GABBARD: I am glad you asked because I was going to say it's not fair to ask these three about their health and their fitness to serve as President but not every of their one of us. I--I am grateful to have been trained very well by the Army and do my best to stay in shape but here is the real question I believe you should be asking is. Who is fit to serve as our commander in chief? This is the most important responsibility that the President has. What Donald Trump has been doing in Syria and what we have just seen with him inviting Turkey to come in and water the Kurds show what an unfit President looks like. It--it highlights how critical it is that we have a President and a commander in chief who is ready on day one bringing experience and understanding in foreign policy and national security. Bringing the experience that I have both serving in Congress now for nearly 7 years, serving on the foreign affairs committee, serving on the armed services committee, subcommittees related to terrorism and upcoming threats, serving on the Homeland security committee. The experience that I have essays soldiers serving for over 16 years in the Army National Guard, deploying twice to the Middle East, being able to serve in different capacities, joint training exercises, training the Kuwait National Guard. I understand the importance of our national security. I am prepared to do this job, to fulfill this responsibility as commander-in-chief-- </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you Congresswoman. </p><p>GABBARD: --on day one. I would like to ask our other candidates this question. I would like to start with Senator Warren. </p><p>BURNETT: Sorry, Sen-- Congress when I am sorry-- </p><p>GABBARD: What her experience and background is to serve - </p><p>BURNETT: I am sorry, thank you. </p><p>GABBARD: -- as commander in chief. </p><p>BURNETT: We are going to take another break now. The CNN New York Times debate live from Otterbein University here in Ohio. We will be back in just a few moments. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>[*]COOPER: Hey, welcome back to the CNN/New York Times Presidential Debate. Marc Lacey, from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Marc? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies. Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?  </p><p>YANG: As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move. But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all of the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment.  </p><p>There's a reason why no one is using Bing today.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>Sorry, Microsoft. It's true. So, it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And, as the parent of two, young children I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its affect on our children. </p><p>Studies clearly show that we are seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use. Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier.  </p><p>What we have to do is we have to home in on the specific problems we are trying to solve and use 21st Century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust remark will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please?  </p><p>WARREN: Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way--when you talk about how it works in competition--about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place, that's Amazon. </p><p>It collects information from every little business and then Amazon does something else--it runs the platform, gets all the information and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game or you get to have a team but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.  </p><p>LACEY: Mr. Steyer, your response?  </p><p>STEYER: Look, I agree with Senator Warren that in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated and that's part of it. But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. </p><p>I started a business from scratch one room, no employers and built a multibillion dollar international business. We are going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.  </p><p>In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump I think somebody who can take a--go door to door with them and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one, his tax plan is a failure, his trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he has failed the American people and he has to go.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?  </p><p>BOOKER: Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used not just in terms of anticompetitive practices but also to undermine our democracy. We have seen in the 16 election, practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform and antitrust, I mean Robert Bork(PH) right now is laughing in--in his--in his sleep.  </p><p>We have a reality in this country where antitrust from pharma to farms is causing trouble. And we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place enforce antitrust laws.  </p><p>And I want to say one last thing--I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, senator. Congressman O'Rourke. You're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which company should be broken up. So, what's the proper level of oversight here?  </p><p>[*]O'ROURKE: We need to set very tough, very clear transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today that allow these social media platforms where we the people have become the product to abuse that public trust and to do so at extraordinary profits. Right now we treat them functionally as a utility when in reality they are more akin to a publisher. They--they curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president. Treat them like the publisher that they are. That is what I will do as President and we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that but I don't think it is the role of a President or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That is something that Donald Trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It is not something that we should do. So tough rules of the road. Protect your personal information, privacy and data and be fearless in the face of these tech giants. </p><p>LACEY: Senators Sanders, your response? </p><p>SANDERS: When we talk about a rigged economy it is not just the grotesque level of income and wealth and equality, it is also the fact that in sector after sector whether it is Wall Street where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is medium where you have 10 media companies that control about 90% of what the American people see, hear or read. Whether it is agribusiness where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country. </p><p>We need a President who has the guts to appoint an Attorney General who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business and protect consumers by ending the price fixing - might--</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. </p><p>SANDERS: --which you see every day. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator--Senator Harris, to you. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make these spread of disinformation worse? </p><p>HARRIS: No, I don't agree with that at all and serving on the Senate intelligence committee working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the presidents of the United States and it will attempt to do it again that--that is a ridiculous argument he is making but I do want to also say this. What we are talking about is a grave injustice. When rules apply to some but not equally to all and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful and so Senator Warren I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account that you did not agree and I would--I would urge you to join me because here we have Donald Trump who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the presidents of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice and he and his account should be taken down. </p><p>We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond. </p><p>WARREN: So look I don't just want to push Donald Trump off twitter, I want to push him out of the White House, that is our job. </p><p>HARRIS: (INAUDIBLE) so join me if you will - make join me in saying that his twitter account should be shut down. </p><p>WARREN: But let's figure--let's figure out-- </p><p>HARRIS: No? </p><p>WARREN: --why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century and yet for decades now we have all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big bag, how the gun industry, big tech, you know we really need to address the elephant in the room and that is how campaigns are financed. </p><p>HARRIS: You can't say you are for corporate responsibility-- </p><p>WARREN: I announced this morning-- </p><p>HARRIS: -- If it doesn't apply to everyone. </p><p>WARREN: I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We have already agreed Bernie and I, we are not taking any money from big Pharma executives. You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. </p><p>[*]WARREN: We need campaign finance rules-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you, Senator Warren-- </p><p>WARREN: --And practices-- </p><p>LACEY: --Senator Harris--  </p><p>HARRIS: --You can't--you-- </p><p>WARREN: --That support us all-- </p><p>HARRIS: --You--it is--it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable-- </p><p>WARREN: --Yes-- </p><p>HARRIS: --holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is there power. It is immense. So-- </p><p>LACEY: --Senator Klobuchar, let me-- </p><p>HARRIS: --you can-- </p><p>LACEY: --bring you in here-- </p><p>HARRIS: --I'm not-- </p><p>WARREN: --So, wait a minute-- </p><p>LACEY: --Your response-- </p><p>HARRIS: --I'm not--I'm not finished. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. As I said-- </p><p>HARRIS: --I'm not finished-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I head up the-- </p><p>WARREN: --No-- </p><p>HARRIS: --And so, what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook. </p><p>WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that. </p><p>HARRIS: So, you will join me-- </p><p>WARREN: --What I do-- </p><p>HARRIS: --In saying Twitter shut down-- </p><p>WARREN: --have a problem with-- </p><p>HARRIS: --That account-- </p><p>WARREN: --is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. </p><p>If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.  </p><p>WARREN: So long as that's-- </p><p>LACEY: --Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here-- </p><p>WARREN: --Where the money-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --I would like to have a-- </p><p>WARREN: --We will never have any (INAUDIBLE)-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom market. So I had a life before government, and what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long-distance market. </p><p>Well, right now we have another Gilded Age going on. And I am the lead Democrat on the antitrust committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take on because they're so overwhelmed. </p><p>But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are saying a startup slump in this-- </p><p>LACEY: --Thank you, Senator-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --country-- </p><p>LACEY: --Secretary Castro-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --and this means everything from-- </p><p>LACEY: --Would like to weigh in-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --tech on down. </p><p>LACEY: Please respond.  </p><p>CASTRO: Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.  </p><p>And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits they should, or it's another--it's a number of other companies, big tech companies, we need to take a stronger stand when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices. And that's what I would do as president. </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Secretary. </p><p>YANG: That's the way we can fight back. </p><p>GABBARD: There's a bigger issue here.  </p><p>BURNETT: Turning-- </p><p>YANG: --The best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. </p><p>If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank-- </p><p>YANG: --The scales against the big tech companies-- </p><p>BURNETT: --Thank you, Mr. Yang.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>GABBARD: There's a bigger issue here.  </p><p>BURNETT: Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they are pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. </p><p>Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them? </p><p>HARRIS: My plan is as followed--as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution and, in particular, Roe v Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v Wade and the Constitution. And if it is not, that law will not go into effect.  </p><p>That's called the pre-clearance, because the reality is that, while we still have, as I said earlier, the state legislate--legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--accountability and consequence. But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen I--I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. And I asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body, and the answer was--no. </p><p>[*]HARRIS: The reality of it is this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species, our bodies were created to do that, and it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body, it is her right, it is her decision. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Harris, thank you. Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response. </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would codify Roe v Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me. You know what I would say to him? I'd say you know--you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that she wanted to put women in jail then you tried to dial it back and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.  </p><p>That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available on perception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again. </p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you. Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond. </p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, let's be clear about this law--these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They are not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideas ideals in our country, liberty, and the ability to control your own body, but they are particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty because this is disproportionately affecting low income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal, that human beings should control their own body.  </p><p>And so the way, as president of the United States, I'm going to do with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House level position. And I will create the office of reproductive freedom and reproductive rights in the white--in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v Wade. I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment so that we are leading the planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator. Congresswoman Gabbard, your response. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>GABBARD: This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive, political weapon. I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place as we've seen them as they are passed in other countries where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point. I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v Wade while making sure that during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of the woman are at risk. </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much. The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in the case challenging some abortions rights. Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v Wade is overturned on your watch, and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights? </p><p>BIDEN: I would not get in a court packing. We--we add three justices, next time around we lose control, they add three justices. We began to lose any credibility for the court has at all. I want to point out that the justices I've supported when I defeated Robert Bork, and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for a better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass--we codify Roe v Wade. The public is already there. Things have changed.  </p><p>And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right and in fact, every woman should have that right. And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court from--from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elana Kagan, who use---used to work for me to others that they in fact support the right of privacy on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that- </p><p>[*]BIDEN: --that's what I would do. Nowhere to get on the court. And, by the way, if in fact the end of this--beginning of next year if in fact, one of the justices steps down--god forbid--in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what--what McConnell did last time out--we would not allow any hearing to be held to the new Justice.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President. Mayor Buttigieg, you have talked about expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?  </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me. Although, I certainly will appoint people who share my values. For example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.  </p><p>What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the Court. We can't go on like this where every single time there is a vacancy we have this apocalyptic, ideological fire fight over what to do next. Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal on how this could be done without a constitutional amendment.  </p><p>But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis. There are other reforms that we could consider from term limits--don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else--to a rotation off the appellate bench.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you.  </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I am not committed to a particular solution but I am committed to establishing a commission on day on that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court because we can't go on like this.  </p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>--he's talking about making the Court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?  </p><p>CASTRO: I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the Court. You know, I think the--the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one. But I actually believe if we were selecting from one of those things that the smarter move would be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.  </p><p>I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe versus Wade, that we codify Roe versus Wade and that we do away with things like the Hyde Amendment because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think that--think about people who do not--people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her healthcare needs met.  </p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?  </p><p>WARREN: I think there are a number of options. I think as Mayor Buttigieg said there are many different ways. People are talking about different options. And, I think we may have to talk about them.  </p><p>But on Roe versus Wade can we just pause for a minute here? I--I lived in an America where abortion was illegal and rich women still got abortions because they could travel--they could go to places where it was legal. What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14 year olds who are molested by a family member. And, we now have support across this country--three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe versus Wade. When you got three out of four Americans supporting it we should be able to get that passed through congress. We should not leave this to the Supreme Court, we should do it through democracy because we can.  </p><p>BURNET: Thank you very much, senator.  </p><p>COOPER: As so many of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny to the compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage. </p><p>Vice President Biden, just on either side of you Senator Warren is calling for big, structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?  </p><p>BIDEN: No. I think their vision is attracting a lot of people. And, I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We got to level with people. Got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done and if you can get it done.  </p><p>I am going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on the stage who has gotten anything really big done--from the Violence Against Women Act, to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act. To be in a position where we, in fact, took a almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going in a Depression. </p><p>Making us in a-- put us in a position where I was able to Roe v--excuse me--able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons. And so, the question is who is best prepared? We all have good-- </p><p>[*]BIDEN: ideas. The question is how--who is going to be able to get it done. How can you get it done? And I am not suggesting they can't but I am suggesting that that is what we should look at and part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you are going to do it and why you are going to do it. That is the way to get it done. The President is supposed to be able to persuade. </p><p>LACEY: Just to clarify, vice president who are you saying is being vague? </p><p>BIDEN: Well these senators said--she is being vague on the issue of--actually both of them are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, look here is the deal it cost $30 trillion. Guess what? That is over $3 trillion, it is more than the entire federal budget. Let me finish, okay?</p><p>LACEY: You--you will both get in. </p><p>BIDEN: If you eliminate the entire Pentagon, every single thing plane, ships, troops, the buildings, everything satellites it would get you--it would pay for a total of four months, four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from? </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, respond. </p><p>SANDERS: In two ways. Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done but you know you also got done and I say this as a good friend you got the disastrous war in Iraq done, you got a bankruptcy bill which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements like NAFTA and (INAUDIBLE) with China done which have cost us 4 million jobs. And let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as to the people of in the other major country on earth and the answer is if we have the guts and I would like to see the Democratic Party have the guts to stand up to the drug, and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of healthcare is the guaranteed care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator </p><p>SANDERS: If we stood together we could create the greatest health care system in the world. </p><p>COOPER: Vice President Biden you can respond and then Senator Warren. </p><p>BIDEN: We can do that without Medicare for All. We can do that by adding a public option. </p><p>SANDERS: No, you can't. </p><p>BIDEN: We can and we can afford to do it. </p><p>SANDERS: You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry. </p><p>BIDEN: The greed and profiteering-- </p><p>COOPER: Let him respond. Vice president? </p><p>BIDEN: The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it  cost them and it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who have negotiated their health insurance and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, your response? </p><p>MOORE: So you started this question with how you get something done. You know following the financial crash of 2008 I have an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people and all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said don't even try because you will never get it passed and sure enough the big banks fought us, the Republicans fought us, some of the Democrats fought us but we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated. </p><p>I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority and I will use it. In Congress on the first day I will pass my anticorruption bill which will be back the influence-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you Senator. </p><p>WARREN: --of money and repeal the filibuster. And the third we want to get something done in America we have to get out there and fight for the things that touch people's lives. </p><p>COOPER: Mayor--mayor-- </p><p>BIDEN: I agree. Let--let me--she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it so let's get those things straight, too. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>WARREN: I am deeply grateful to President Obama who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law but understand - might-- </p><p>BIDEN: You did a hell of a job in your job. </p><p>WARREN: Thank you. </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>But understand this, it was a dream big fight hard. People told me go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator </p><p>WARREN: I said no. Let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy and President Obama said I will fight for that and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration.  </p><p>[*]WARREN: We have to be-- </p><p>BIDEN: --Not me-- </p><p>WARREN: --willing to make-- </p><p>COOPER: --Mayor Buttigieg-- </p><p>WARREN: --Good, big structural change. </p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump? That's the essential question. </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past-- </p><p>(LAUGHTER)  </p><p>--what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive. We're being offered a false choice. </p><p>I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration. I don't agree that there's any such thing as a back to normal, because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place. </p><p>But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight. Absolutely we have to fight for the big changes at hand. But it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. </p><p>Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things that we've attempted in my lifetime; Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban which would be a huge deal, making college free for low and middle income students.  </p><p>Yet there are some here on the stage to say it doesn't count unless we go even further. Free college for low and middle income students isn't good enough unless were also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. </p><p>We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we've done-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, mayor-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --In my lifetime-- </p><p>COOPER: --Senator-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: And bring the American-- </p><p>BIDEN: --I did not say back to normal-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --People together.  </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. </p><p>WARREN: He called me out by name. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar?  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.  </p><p>COOPER: Senator Klobuchar? </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: You know, this isn't a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're bold. </p><p>But we can't get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win. And what I have done is win, and the only one up here, time and time again, the reddest of red districts, Michelle Bachman's. I read that--I won that district three times, rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where is comfortable but where it's uncomfortable. </p><p>And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and all over Ohio and in Iowa, because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around the state and make-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: --Donald Trump pay for it. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, she--she referenced you-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--So you can respond.  </p><p>WARREN: Now, people who are struggling to pay healthcare are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today. </p><p>And anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who's likely to win them up. For me, this is about knowing what's broken, knowing how to fix it. And yes, I'm willing to get out there and fight for it. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: But there's a missing piece, and that is-- </p><p>SANDERS: --Yeah. Well-- </p><p>COOPER: --Senator Sanders, why-- </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: --Bring the American people to get it done-- </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, why is your--your approach more likely to be President Trump? </p><p>SANDERS: I'll tell you why. </p><p>COOPER: Please respond.  </p><p>SANDERS: And here's the radical reason why. It's what the American people want-- </p><p>WARREN: --Yes-- </p><p>SANDERS: --All right? The American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71 percent of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we've got to make public colleges and universities tuition free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren. </p><p>The way you with an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old. You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You gotta bring working people and young people and poor people into the-- </p><p>COOPER: --Senator-- </p><p>SANDERS: --Political process-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>SANDERS: --Because-- </p><p>COOPER: --Congressman-- </p><p>SANDERS: --They know you stand for them, not corporate America.  </p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, is-- </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>--Is political revolution what the American people want? Your response. </p><p>O'ROURKE: There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress, I found that El Paso, Texas had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental health care provider at the VA. I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country, or even most people in El Paso. But it was important to those veterans who I served. So, we set about turning around at the VA, hiring up the psychiatrist and psychologist and therapist to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country. </p><p>And we were able to do that. And we took what we learned and we applied it to a national law, as a member of the minority working with Republicans and Democrats alike, to expand mental health care access for veterans nationally. </p><p>[*]O'ROURKE: In Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you, Congressman-- </p><p>O'ROURKE: --Talking about this progressive agenda, and winning more votes than any democrat has ever won. That's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020. </p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, thank you. We have to take a quick break. The CNN New York times debate live from Ohio will continue right after this.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>[*]COOPER: We are back with the CNN/New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on. Last week, Ellen degenerates was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. </p><p>Ellen defended their friendship saying, \"We are all different and I think that we have forgotten that that's okay that we are all different.\" So in that spirit, we'd like you to tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us and what impact it's had on you and your beliefs. Secretary Castro, let's begin with you. </p><p>CASTRO: Well, first of all, thank you to Mark, thank you Anderson, and thank you Erin and CNN and New York Times and everybody who's here tonight. You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that have a lot to teach me or people who grew up very different for me. </p><p>Also, teachers as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine, and sometimes also, and this goes to the heart of your question, I think, people who thought differently from me. Folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there is a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.  </p><p>I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks. I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. </p><p>I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions and there are people, whether it's our former President George W. Bush or others should be held accountable, just as we should be--we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done. </p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard? </p><p>GABBARD: Thank you. No, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know we greet each other with aloha. It's not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we are all connected. We are all brothers and sisters. </p><p>We are all God's children. So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially with Republicans like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We've developed a friendship that's based on respect and he's been there for me during some personally challenging times. </p><p>The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.  </p><p>When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorable's, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to--to restore the White House represents light and compassion and respect for every American, godless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation. So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, Tulsi2020.com for more information. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman. Senator Klobuchar. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>KLOBUCHAR: For me it's Senator John McCain. And I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him and he would sometimes when we were seated with world leaders and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is a lead Democrat on this trip and she will go next.\" And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying and he pointed to some words in his book because he could hardly talk and the word said this, \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\" That's what we're doing right now.  </p><p>And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other because the way we win, and not just-- </p><p>[*]KLOBUCHAR: the presidency, to take back the U.S. Senate is by winning big. And, the way we win big is with the fired up democratic base that's out there today. But it's also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this and I ask you to join me because I've done it before. And I will do it again. AmyKlobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you very much. Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.  </p><p>STEYER: So, I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina-Indiana Berry(PH) who is fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. She is a different gender, she is a different race, she is from a different part of the country--but she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.  </p><p>My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York public schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college, my grandfather is a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg.  </p><p>When I asked him what that experience meant he said when you see something wrong in your society you fight it from the first day and every single day after. And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  </p><p>And, over 10 years ago I thought that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I have been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully and that is why I'm running for president. Because our government has failed. It has been bought by corporations and it is absolutely essential to return power to the people.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you.  </p><p>STEYER: I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do--which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every, single day.  </p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer. Congressman O'Rourke?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>O'ROURKE: I've always tried to bring people into the solution that we have to our common challenges--regardless of the differences. I did that as a small business owner more than 20 years ago making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas. Did it as a member of the City Council where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats but my fellow El Pasoans who has a responsibility to deliver for our community.  </p><p>As a member of Congress I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the VA there March of 2017, found that my flight had been snowed in in Washington D. C. Happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington? And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala. Last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1600 miles across the country--livestreamed the conversation--a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.  </p><p>By the end of that trip not only had we formed a friendship but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill showing party leaders from either side that republicans and democrats can work together on an otherwise contentious issue.  </p><p>And across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes, wining Democrats. We won independents and republicans in record numbers as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have. And to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.  </p><p>LACEY: Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.  </p><p>BOOKER: Look, I have so many I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements.  </p><p>When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendship across the aisle. I go to bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner in a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan and he's a meat eating Texan.  </p><p>But I'll tell you this right now--this is the moment in America that this is our test the spirit of our country I believe in the values of rugged individuals and self-reliance. But think about our history. (INAUDIBLE) individualism didn't get us to the moon, it didn't beat the Nazis, it didn't map the human genome, it didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big--and Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman all of us on this stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose. This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other.  </p><p>The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair. Because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy and remind America  </p><p>[*]BOOKER: that patriotism is love of country and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women. And love is not sentimentality, it is not a name it(ph), love is struggle, love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we are ever going to make it as a nation we must mutually pledge to each other-- </p><p>COOPER: Thank you. </p><p>BOOKER: --our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor. I am running for President to restore that sacred honor and if you believe (INAUDIBLE) like I do please join me by going to CoryBooker.com. Thank you. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Yang? </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>YANG: First I want to thank all of the voters tuned in that home. If you don't feel like you answered your question--you got your question answered tonight it's understandable there are 12 of us. I am going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday my website yang2020.com and if you ask your question tonight there is a better chance I will get to it. </p><p>My surprising friendship--it has been so much fun running for President because I've gotten to meet so many of Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred who is an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours, he spent some time in jail, I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs and I am happy to say that after our ride together he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign which was a thrill for me and we have remained in touch ever since. </p><p>The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth Industrial Revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacist and radiologist. It does not care about our party. Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we are going to build a wall, we are going to turn the clock back, we are going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward, we have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left, it is not right, it is forward and that is where we must take the country in 2020. </p><p>COOPER: Mr. Yang, thank you very much. </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>Senator Harris? </p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I actually I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bails system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing but we agree on that and after we joined forces he said to me, Kamala, you know Appalachia loves this and it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us and I guess that is why I am running. </p><p>I do believe that to beat Donald Trump but also to heal our country we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I will tell you my mother was 19 when she left India alone and she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer and so she arrived in California, she got you know-- she was supposed to have an arranged marriage but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father and that produced my sister and me, they got married but when I was five that marriage ended but my mother convinced us that we could do anything and so I became the first woman Attorney General of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate and I will tell you that is part of why I am running because Donald Trump if he had his way my story would not be possible and I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideals will always hold true and so that is what is at stake in this election and I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak these story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg? </p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics and we learned to trust each other with our lives. When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad emigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learn to trust each other. In fact the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I will follow in the pattern tonight and point out you could go to PeteforAmerica.com and read all about it. </p><p>It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country because I think that is what friendship and that is what service can create. </p><p>And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair. </p><p>I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president. When the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future. </p><p>COOPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders? </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>SANDERS: When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veteran's legislation in modern American history and I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate, so we had to go back to the drawing board.  </p><p>And I worked with John McCain, and I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration. </p><p>And more recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, though he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S.--get the votes to get U.S.--the U.S. troops out of that area. </p><p>But I think at the end of the day what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion. And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country. </p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator Warren? </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>WARREN: You asked about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. 27 years ago when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush the first's Solicitor General, a deeply principled Republican. And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was, but he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.  </p><p>You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three older brothers. They'll served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we are divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together. We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in. </p><p>Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a center and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.  </p><p>People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more. We want an America that works for everyone. It 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep-- </p><p>COOPER: --Thank you-- </p><p>WARREN: --To be here, to be in this fight. I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone. </p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>Vice President Biden? </p><p>BIDEN: This is a reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle to get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.  </p><p>The two people maybe who would surprise you the most were--and twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy and he was my--he was assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends, became very close friends with my wife Jill. He visited our home, he was there with his children. And on his deathbed, he asked me to do his eulogy.  </p><p>John--I would say to John, John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight, and he'd say you didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve. But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable. And one of the things--that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people, generally.  </p><p>Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. And the only way we're going to do be able to do that that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity. And lastly, we have to unite the country because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with their heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for God sake, get up. Get up and remember this is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we are unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all, period. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p><p>COOPER: Candidates, thank you. That concludes the fourth Democratic presidential debate. We want to think Otterbein University for hosting us. Now please stay tuned to CNN for special coverage of tonight's debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo. </p><p>(APPLAUSE)  </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8T-MB31-F15W-H2KK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Mark Lacey from the New York Times starts off our questioning. Mark?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LACEY: Thank you. Let's turn to the growing concerns over the power of big tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[22:05:00]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Yang, Senator Warren is calling for companies like Facebook, Amazon, and Google to be broken up. Is she right? Does that need to happen?</p><p>YANG: As usual, Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem. There are absolutely excesses in technology and in some cases having them divest parts of their business is the right move.</p><p>But we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today. Sorry, Microsoft. It's true.</p><p>So it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country. And as the parent of two young children, I'm particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.</p><p>Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we're trying to solve and use 21st century solutions for 21st century problems. Using a 20th century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, is Mr. Yang wrong? Your response, please.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I'm not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It's time to fight back. Think about it this way. When you talk about how it works in competition, about 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon.</p><p>It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses. Look, you get to be the umpire in the baseball game, or you get to have a team, but you don't get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating, big tech, big pharma, big oil, all of them.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Mr. Steyer, your response?</p><p>STEYER: Look, I agree with Senator Warren that, in fact, monopolies have to be dealt with. They either have to be broken up or regulated, and that's part of it.</p><p>But we have to understand that Mr. Trump is going to be running on the economy. He's going to be saying he's the person who can make it grow. I started a business from scratch -- one room, no employers -- and built a multi-billion-dollar international business. We're going to have to show the American people that we don't just know how to tax and have programs to break up companies but also talk about prosperity, talk about investing in the American people, talk about harnessing the innovation and competition of the American private sector.</p><p>In fact, if we want to beat Mr. Trump, I think somebody who can go toe to toe with him and show him to be a fraud and a failure as a businessperson, and a fraud and a failure as a steward of the American economy is going to be necessary. He is one. His tax plan's a failure. His trade war is a failure. I would love to take him on as a real businessman and show that, in fact, he's failed the American people, and he has to go.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>Senator Booker, how do you respond? Would a President Booker break up big tech companies like Facebook and Amazon?</p><p>BOOKER: Anybody that does not think that we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy -- we have seen it in the '16 election practices being used that have not been corrected now. We need regulation and reform.</p><p>And antitrust, I mean Robert Bork right now is laughing in his sleep. We have a reality in this country where antitrust, from pharma to farms, is causing trouble, and we have to deal with this. As president of the United States, I will put people in place that enforce antitrust laws.</p><p>And I want to say one last thing, and I feel qualified to say this as the vegan on the stage. Going back to the fact that we -- it's rich to me that we asked three people about their health when looking at this stage we know that the most unhealthy person running for the presidency in 2020 is Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke, you say you're not sure if it's appropriate for a president to designate which companies should be broken up. So what's the proper level of oversight here?</p><p>O'ROURKE: Yeah, we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road, the kind of rules that we do not have today, that allow these social media platforms, where we, the people, have become the product, to abuse that public trust, and to do so at extraordinary profits.</p><p>Right now, we treat them functionally as a utility, when,</p><p>[22:10:00]</p><p>in reality, they're more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see. Our pictures and personal information that they share with others, we would allow no publisher to do what Facebook is doing, to publish that ad that Senator Warren has rightfully called out, that CNN has refused to air because it is untrue and tells lies about the vice president, treat them like the publisher that they are. That's what I will do as president.</p><p>And we will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that, but I don't think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up. That's something that Donald Trump has done, in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It's not something that we should do.</p><p>So tough rules of the road, protect your personal information, privacy, and data, and be fearless in the face of these tech giants.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Sanders, your response?</p><p>SANDERS: When we talk about a rigged economy, it's not just the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality. It is also the fact that in sector after sector, whether it is Wall Street, where you have six banks that have assets equivalent to half of the GDP of the United States, whether it is media, where you have 10 media companies that control about 90 percent of what the American people see, hear, or read, whether it is agribusiness, where we see merger after merger which is resulting in the decline of family-based farming in this country, we need a president who has the guts to appoint an attorney general who will take on these huge monopolies, protect small business, and protect consumers by ending the price fixing that we see every day.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator. Senator Harris, to you, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says that splitting up big tech companies will make election interference more likely because the companies won't be able to work together to fight it. Could breaking up these companies make the spread of disinformation worse?</p><p>HARRIS: No, I don't agree with that at all. And serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee, working with Amy Klobuchar on what we need to do to upgrade the elections infrastructure, knowing that Russia needs to be held accountable for the fact that they interfered in the election of the president of the United States and will attempt to do it again, that's -- that's a ridiculous argument he's making.</p><p>But I do want to also say this. What we're talking about is a grave injustice, when rules apply to some but not equally to all, and in particular when the rules that apply to the powerless don't apply to the powerful.</p><p>And so, Senator Warren, I just want to say that I was surprised to hear that you did not agree with me that on this subject of what should be the rules around corporate responsibility for these big tech companies, when I called on Twitter to suspend Donald Trump's account, that you did not agree, and I would urge you to join me.</p><p>Because here we have Donald Trump, who has 65 million Twitter followers and is using that platform as the president of the United States to openly intimidate witnesses, to threaten witnesses, to obstruct justice, and he and his account should be taken down.</p><p>We saw in El Paso that that shooter in his manifesto was informed by how Donald Trump uses that platform, and this is a matter of corporate responsibility. Twitter should be held accountable and shut down that site. It is a matter of safety and corporate accountability.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you. Senator Warren, you can respond.</p><p>WARREN: So, look, I don't just want to push Donald Trump off Twitter. I want to push him out of the White House. That's our job.</p><p>HARRIS: Well, join me -- join me in saying that his Twitter account should be shut down.</p><p>WARREN: But let's figure -- no. Let's figure out...</p><p>HARRIS: No?</p><p>WARREN: ... why it is that we have had laws on the books for antitrust for over a century, and yet for decades now, we've all called on how the big drug companies are calling the shots in Washington, big ag, how the gun industry, big tech -- you know, we really need to address the elephant in the room, and that is how campaigns are financed.</p><p>HARRIS: You can't say you're for corporate responsibility if it doesn't apply to everyone.</p><p>WARREN: I announced this morning -- I announced this morning that I'm not going to take any money from big tech executives, from Wall Street executives. We've already agreed, Bernie and I, we're not taking any money from big pharma executives.</p><p>You can't go behind closed doors and take the money of these executives and then turn around and expect that these are the people who are actually finally going to enforce the laws. We need campaign finance rules and practices...</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator Warren. Senator Harris?</p><p>WARREN: ... that support us all.</p><p>HARRIS: You -- it does not represent a system of justice to say that the rules will apply differently to different people. This is a matter, you are saying, of holding big tech accountable.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>[22:15:00]</p><p>HARRIS: Holding big tech accountable because they have an outsized influence on people's perceptions about issues, and they actually influence behaviors. We all have to agree this is their power. It is immense.</p><p>LACEY: Senator Klobuchar, let me bring you in here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LACEY: Your response?</p><p>HARRIS: I'm not finished. I'm not finished.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARRIS: And so what I am saying is that it seems to me that you would be able to join me in saying the rule has to apply to Twitter the same way it does to Facebook.</p><p>WARREN: Look, I think all of the rules should apply across the board. I don't have a problem with that.</p><p>HARRIS: So you will join me in saying Twitter should shut down that account?</p><p>WARREN: What I do have a problem with is that if we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big tech, then we should ask if people are taking money from the big tech executives. If we're going to talk seriously about breaking up big drug companies, we should ask if people are financing their campaigns by taking money from big drug executives. If we are going to talk about Wall Street and having some serious regulation over Wall Street, we should ask if people are funding their campaigns by taking money from those executives.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Senator Klobuchar, let's bring you in here. (CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would like to have a different take on this. I was in the private sector for 14 years, represented companies that were fighting to get into the telecom markets. I had a life before government.</p><p>And what I saw was when we got more competition there, the prices went down in a big way in the long distance market. Well, right now we have another gilded age going on, and I am the lead Democrat on the Antitrust Committee. I have the lead legislation, which means, one, changing the standard so we can do a better job of doing just what we've been talking about here, is breaking down some of this consolidation, and also making sure that the enforcers have the resources to take them on because they're so overwhelmed.</p><p>But the issue here is this. Start talking about this as a pro- competition issue. This used to be a Republican and Democratic issue, because America, our founding fathers, actually wanted to have less consolidation. We were a place of entrepreneurship. We are seeing a startup slump in this country.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Senator. Secretary Castro, would you like to weigh in?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: And this means everything from tech on down.</p><p>LACEY: Please respond.</p><p>CASTRO: Yeah, I think that we're on the right track in terms of updating how we look at monopolistic practices and setting, as Congressman O'Rourke said, rules for the road that match the challenges that we face today.</p><p>And, you know, whether that's Amazon that is leveraging its size I think to help put small businesses out of business, and then at the same time shortchanging a lot of its workers, not paying them as they should, not giving them the benefits that they should, or it's a number of other companies, big tech companies. We need to take a stronger stance when it comes to cracking down on monopolistic trade practices, and that's what I would do as president.</p><p>LACEY: Thank you, Mr. Secretary.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>YANG: The best way we can fight back -- the best way we can fight back against big tech companies is to say our data is our property. Right now, our data is worth more than oil. How many of you remember getting your data check in the mail? It got lost. It went to Facebook, Amazon, Google. If we say this is our property and we share in the gains, that's the best way we can balance the scales against the big tech companies.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Yang.</p><p>GABBARD: There's a bigger issue here... BURNETT: Turning to women's reproductive rights, Ohio is now one of several states that has banned abortions after as early as six weeks of pregnancy. Many women don't even know they're pregnant at that time. The Ohio law, like many others, is being challenged in the courts and has not yet taken effect. Senator Harris, if states prevail on restricting abortion, what's your plan to stop them?</p><p>HARRIS: My plan is as -- as follows. For any state that passes a law that violates the Constitution, and in particular Roe v. Wade, our Department of Justice will review that law to determine if it is compliant with Roe v. Wade and the Constitution, and if it is not, that law will not go into effect. That's called pre-clearance.</p><p>Because the reality is that while we still have -- as I said earlier -- these state legislators who are outdated and out of touch, mostly men who are telling women what to do with their bodies, then there needs to be accountability and consequence.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, I'll go further. You may have seen it. I questioned Brett Kavanaugh when I was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and asked him as a nominee to serve on the United States Supreme Court, could he think of any law that tells a man what to do with his body? And the answer was, uh, uh, no.</p><p>The reality of it is, this is still a fundamental issue of justice for women in America. Women have been given the responsibility to perpetuate the human species. Our bodies were created to do that. And it does not give any other person the right to tell a woman what to do with that body. It is her body. It is her right. It is her decision.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Harris, thank you.</p><p>[22:20:00]</p><p>Senator Klobuchar, what would you do to stop states from prevailing? Your response?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: I would codify Roe v. Wade and make it the law of the land. But what I want to do right now is just say, what if Donald Trump was standing up here on the debate stage with me? You know what I would say to him? I said, you knew -- you said you wanted to do this in your race for president. You actually said that you wanted to put women in jail. Then you tried to dial it back, and you said you wanted to put doctors in jail.</p><p>That is exactly what the Alabama law is. It put doctors in jail for 99 years. You, Donald Trump, are not on the side of women. You are not on the side of people of this country, when over 75 percent of people want to keep Roe v. Wade on the book, when over 90 percent of people want to make sure we have available contraception. You defunded Planned Parenthood. I would fund it again.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you.</p><p>Senator Booker, if states prevail on restricting abortion, how would you stop them? Please respond.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, first of all, let's be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio. They're not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country -- liberty, the ability to control your own body -- but they're particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty, because this is disproportionately affecting low-income women in this country, people in rural areas in this country. It is an assault on the most fundamental ideal that human beings should control their own body.</p><p>And so the way as president of the United States I'm going to deal with this is, first of all, elevating it like we have with other national crises to a White House-level position. And I will create the Office of Reproductive Freedom and Reproductive Rights in the White House and make sure that we begin to fight back on a systematic attempt that's gone on for decades to undermine Roe v. Wade.</p><p>I will fight to codify it, and I will also make sure that we fight as this country to repeal the Hyde amendment, so that we are leading the Planet Earth in defending the global assault we see on women right now.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>Congresswoman Gabbard, your response?</p><p>GABBARD: This is often one of the most difficult decisions that a woman will ever have to make, and it's unfortunate to see how in this country it has for so long been used as a divisive political weapon.</p><p>I agree with Hillary Clinton on one thing, disagree with her on many others, but when she said abortion should be safe, legal, and rare, I think she's correct. We see how the consequences of laws that you're referring to can often lead to a dangerous place, as we've seen them as they're passed in other countries, where a woman who has a miscarriage past that six weeks could be imprisoned because abortion would be illegal at that point.</p><p>I do, however, think that there should be some restrictions in place. I support codifying Roe v. Wade while making sure that, during the third trimester, abortion is not an option unless the life or severe health consequences of a woman are at risk.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much.</p><p>The Supreme Court is currently made up of five Republican-appointed justices and four appointed by Democrats. The court just announced it will hear arguments in a case challenging some abortion rights.</p><p>Vice President Biden, the Constitution does not specify the number of justices that serve on the Supreme Court. If Roe v. Wade is overturned on your watch and you can't pass legislation in Congress, would you seek to add justices to the Supreme Court to protect women's reproductive rights?</p><p>BIDEN: I would not get into court packing. We had three justices. Next time around, we lose control, they add three justices. We begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.</p><p>I want to point out that the justices I've supported, when I defeated Robert Bork -- and I say when I defeated Robert Bork, I made sure we guaranteed a woman's right to choose for the better part of a generation. I would make sure that we move and insist that we pass, we codify Roe v. Wade.</p><p>The public is already there. Things have changed. And I would go out and I would campaign against those people in the state of Ohio, Alabama, et cetera, who in fact are throwing up this barrier. Reproductive rights are a constitutional right. And, in fact, every woman should have that right.</p><p>And so I would not pack the court. What I would do is make sure that the people that I recommended for the court, from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to Elena Kagan, who used to work for me, to others, that they, in fact, support the right of privacy, on which the entire notion of a woman's right to choose is based. And that's what I would do. No one would get on the court.</p><p>And by the way, if, in fact, at the end of this -- beginning next year, if, in fact, one of the justices steps down, God forbid, in fact, I would make sure that we would do exactly what McConnell did last time out. We would not allow any hearing to be held for a new justice.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.</p><p>Mayor Buttigieg, you have discussed expanding the court from 9 to 15 justices. What's your response to the vice president?</p><p>[22:25:00]</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: That's right. When I proposed reforming the Supreme Court, some folks said that was too bold to even contemplate. Now, I'm not talking about packing the court just with people who agree with me, although I certainly will appoint people who share my values, for example, the idea that women's reproductive freedom is an American right.</p><p>What I'm talking about is reforms that will depoliticize the court. We can't go on like this, where every single time there is a vacancy, we have this apocalyptic ideological firefight over what to do next.</p><p>Now, one way to fix this would be to have a 15-member court where five of the members can only be appointed by unanimous agreement of the other 10. Smarter legal minds than mine are discussing this in the Yale Law Journal and how this could be done without a constitutional amendment. But the point is that not everybody arrives on a partisan basis.</p><p>There are other reforms that we could consider, from term limits -- don't forget, justices used to just retire like everybody else -- to a rotation off the appellate bench.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I'm not wedded to a particular solution, but I am committed to establishing a commission on day one...</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you, Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... that will propose reforms to depoliticize the Supreme Court, because we can't go on like this.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much, Mayor Buttigieg. Secretary Castro, he's talking about making the court bigger. Your response? Is it a good idea?</p><p>CASTRO: I don't think it is. I wouldn't pack the court. You know, I think the plan that Mayor Pete mentioned is an interesting one, but I actually believe, if we were selecting from one of those things, that the smarter move might be to look at term limits or having people cycle off from the appellate courts so that you would have a replenishment of perspective.</p><p>I would also make sure that I appoint as president people who respect the precedent of Roe v. Wade, that we codify Roe v. Wade, and that we do away with things like the Hyde amendment, because you shouldn't only be able to have reproductive freedom if you have money. We have to think about people who do not, people who are poor. And we have to concern ourselves not only with reproductive freedom, but also reproductive justice and invest in the ability of every woman to be able to make a choice and to be able to have her health care needs met.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator Warren, would you consider adding more justices to the Supreme Court to protect Roe v. Wade? Your response?</p><p>WARREN: I think there are a number of options. I think, as Mayor Buttigieg said, there are many different ways. People are talking about different options, and I think we may have to talk about them.</p><p>But on Roe v. Wade, can we just pause for a minute here? I lived in an America where abortion was illegal, and rich women still got abortions, because they could travel, they could go to places where it was legal.</p><p>What we're talking about now is that the people who are denied access to abortion are the poor, are the young, are 14-year-olds who were molested by a family member. And we now have support across this country. Three out of four Americans believe in the rule of Roe v. Wade. When you've got three out of four Americans supporting it, we should be able to get that passed through Congress.</p><p>BURNETT: Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: We should not leave this to the Supreme Court. We should do it through democracy, because we can.</p><p>BURNETT: Thank you very much, Senator.</p><p>COOPER: As some of you have indicated, the differences between all of you on this stage are tiny compared to the differences between you and President Trump. There are, however, fundamental differences between many of you on this stage.</p><p>Vice President Biden, just on either side of you, Senator Warren is calling for big structural change. Senator Sanders is calling for a political revolution. Will their visions attract the kind of voters that the Democrats need to beat Donald Trump?</p><p>BIDEN: Well, I think their vision is attracting a lot of people, and I think a lot of what they have to say is really important. But, you know, Senator Warren said we can't be running any vague campaigns. We've got to level with people. We've got to level with people and tell them exactly what we're going to do, how we're going to get it done, and if you can get it done.</p><p>I'm going to say something that is probably going to offend some people here, but I'm the only one on this stage that has gotten anything really big done, from the Violence Against Women Act to making sure that we pass the Affordable Care Act to being in a position where we, in fact, took almost a $90 billion act that kept us from going into a depression, making us -- putting us in a position where I was able to end roe -- excuse me, able to end the issue of gun sales in terms of assault weapons.</p><p>And so the question is, who is best prepared? We all have good ideas. The question is, who is going to be able to get it done? How can you get it done? And I'm not suggesting they can't, but I'm suggesting that that's what we should look at. And part of that requires you not being vague. Tell people what it's going to cost, how you're going to do it, and why you're going to do it. That's the way to get it done. Presidents are supposed to be able to persuade.</p><p>COOPER: Just to clarify, Vice President, who are you saying is being vague?</p><p>[22:30:00]</p><p>BIDEN: Well, the senator said -- she's being vague on the issue of -- actually, both are being vague on the issue of Medicare for all. No, look, here's the deal. Come on. It costs $30 trillion. Guess what? That's over $3 trillion -- it's more than the entire federal budget -- let me finish, OK?</p><p>COOPER: You'll both get in.</p><p>BIDEN: If you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing, plane, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites, it would get you -- it would pay for a total of four months. Four months. Where do you get the rest? Where does it come from?</p><p>SANDERS: Two things. Let me explain in two ways.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, respond. SANDERS: Joe, you talked about working with Republicans and getting things done. But you know what you also got done? And I say this as a good friend. You got the disastrous war in Iraq done. You got a bankruptcy bill, which is hurting middle-class families all over this country. You got trade agreements, like NAFTA and PNTR, with China done, which have cost us 4 million jobs.</p><p>Now, let's get to Medicare for all. Let's be honest. We spend twice as much per person as do the people of any other major country on Earth. And the answer is, if we have the guts that I would like to see the Democratic Party have that guts, to stand up to the drug companies and the insurance companies and tell them that the function of health care is to guarantee care to all people, not to make $100 billion in profit.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>SANDERS: If we stood together, we could create the greatest health care system in the world.</p><p>COOPER: Vice President Biden, you can respond, and then Senator Warren.</p><p>BIDEN: We can do that without Medicare for all. We can do that by adding a public option.</p><p>SANDERS: No.</p><p>BIDEN: We can.</p><p>SANDERS: No, you can't.</p><p>BIDEN: And we can afford to do it.</p><p>SANDERS: You've got to take on the greed and the profiteering of the health care industry.</p><p>BIDEN: By the way, the greed and...</p><p>COOPER: Let him respond. Mr. Vice President?</p><p>BIDEN: The greed and profiteering of those insurance companies, they are as much against my bill as they are anybody else. They were strongly against Obamacare. They know it cost them. And it's going to take away the right of people to choose, the 160 million people out there who've negotiated their health insurance, and they want to keep it. They should have a right to keep it.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, your response?</p><p>WARREN: So you started this question with how you got something done. You know, following the financial crash of 2008, I had an idea for a consumer agency that would keep giant banks from cheating people. And all of the Washington insiders and strategic geniuses said, don't even try, because you will never get it passed. And sure enough, the big banks fought us. The Republicans fought us. Some of the Democrats fought us. But we got that agency passed into law. It has now forced big banks to return more than $12 billion directly to people they cheated.</p><p>I served in the Obama administration. I know what we can do by executive authority, and I will use it. In Congress, on the first day, I will pass my anti-corruption bill, which will beat back the influence of money...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: ... and repeal the filibuster. And the third, we want to get something done in America, we have to get out there and fight...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: ... for the things that touch people's lives.</p><p>COOPER: Mayor...</p><p>BIDEN: I agree. Let me -- she referenced me. I agreed with the great job she did, and I went on the floor and got you votes. I got votes for that bill. I convinced people to vote for it. So let's get those things straight, too.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Warren, do you want to respond?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: I am deeply grateful to President Obama, who fought so hard to make sure that agency was passed into law, and I am deeply grateful to every single person who fought for it and who helped pass it into law. But understand...</p><p>BIDEN: You did a hell of a job in your job.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>But understand this. It was a dream big, fight hard. People told me, go for something little, go for something small, go for something that the big corporations will be able to accept.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: I said, no, let's go for an agency that will make structural change in our economy.</p><p>COOPER: Senator, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: And President Obama said, I will fight for that, and he sometimes had to fight against people in his own administration. We have...</p><p>BIDEN: Not me.</p><p>WARREN: We have to be willing to make good, big, structural change.</p><p>COOPER: Mayor Buttigieg, which is the right vision for a Democrat to beat Donald Trump? That's the essential question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: If I had a buck for every argument that I've witnessed like this, I could pay for college for everybody. We need to move past what has been consuming this whole political space for as long as I've been alive.</p><p>We're being offered a false choice. I don't agree with the vice president that Trump is an aberration.</p><p>[22:35:00]</p><p>I don't agree that there's any such thing as back to normal. Because here in the industrial Midwest, definitely where I live, normal didn't work. That's part of how we got here. That's part of how a guy like Donald Trump managed to get within cheating distance of the Oval Office in the first place.</p><p>But I also don't agree with Senator Warren that the only way forward is infinite partisan combat. Yes, we have to fight -- absolutely, we have to fight for the big changes at hand, but it's going to take more than fighting. Once again, I want to take you back to that day after Trump has stopped being president. Think about what the president can do to unify a new American majority for some of the boldest things we've attempted in my lifetime -- Medicare for all who want it, actually getting something done on immigration for the first time since the '80s, an assault weapons ban, which would be a huge deal, making college free for low- and middle-income students.</p><p>Yet there are some here on this stage who say it doesn't count unless we go even further, free college for low- and middle-income students isn't good enough unless we're also paying for the children of billionaires. Immigration reform isn't enough unless we also decriminalize border crossings. We have an opportunity to do the biggest things we've done...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: ... in my lifetime...</p><p>COOPER: Senator?</p><p>BIDEN: I did not say back to normal.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mayor. Senator Klobuchar? Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: Thank you. You know, this isn't a flyover part of the country to me. The heartland is where I live. And I want to win those states that we lost last time, and I have bold ideas to get us there. And I think just because they're different than Elizabeth's doesn't mean they're bold.</p><p>But we can't get any of this done on climate change or immigration reform unless they win. And what I have done is win and the only one up here, time and time again, the reddest of red districts, Michele Bachmann's, I -- I won that district three times, rural districts that border Iowa and North and South Dakota. And I do it by going not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable.</p><p>And that is why I have been in Pennsylvania and in Michigan and in Wisconsin and all over Ohio and in Iowa, because I think we need to build a blue Democratic wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Senator Warren, she referenced you, so you can respond.</p><p>WARREN: Now, people who are struggling to pay health care are fighting today. People who are getting crushed by student loans are in a fight today. People who are getting stopped by the police or paid less because of the color of their skin are in a fight today.</p><p>And anyone who doesn't understand that Americans are already in these fights is not someone who is likely to win them. For me, this is about knowing what's broken, knowing how to fix it, and, yes, I'm willing to get out there and fight for it.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: There's a missing people, and that is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, why is your approach more likely to beat President Trump?</p><p>SANDERS: I'll tell you why.</p><p>COOPER: Please respond.</p><p>SANDERS: And here's the radical reason why. It's what the American people want.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>SANDERS: All right, the American people do not want tax breaks for billionaires. They want the rich to start paying their fair share of taxes. A poll came out yesterday, 71 percent of Democrats support Medicare for all. The people of this country understand that we've got to make public colleges and universities tuition-free. And more and more Americans, including Republicans, understand we need bold action if we're going to save this planet for our children and our grandchildren.</p><p>The way you win an election in this time in history is not the same old, same old. You have to inspire people. You have to excite people. You've got to bring working people and young people and poor people into the political process...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>SANDERS: ... because they know you stand for them, not corporate America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, is political revolution what the American people want? Your response.</p><p>O'ROURKE: There was some talk about getting big things done. When I was first elected to Congress, I found that El Paso, Texas, had the worst wait times in the country to see a mental health care provider at the V.A. I don't know how sensational or exciting that was to everyone in the country or even most people in El Paso, but it was important to those veterans who I serve.</p><p>So we set about turning around the V.A., hiring up the psychiatrists and psychologists and therapists to take care of those women and men who had put their lives on the line for this country. And we were able to do that, and we took what we learned, and we applied it to a national law as a member of the minority working with Republicans and Democrats alike to expand mental health care access for veterans nationally.</p><p>And then in Texas, one of what was thought to be the reddest states in the country, going to every single county...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congressman.</p><p>O'ROURKE: ... talking about this progressive agenda, and winning more votes than any Democrat has ever won, that's the way that we defeat Donald Trump in November of 2020.</p><p>COOPER: Congressman O'Rourke, thank you. We have to take a quick break. The CNN-New York Times debate live from Ohio will continue right after this.</p><p>[22:44:29]</p><p>COOPER: We are back with the CNN-New York Times Democratic presidential debate. We have time for one more question that we would like all of you to weigh in on.</p><p>Last week, Ellen DeGeneres was criticized after she and former President George W. Bush were seen laughing together at a football game. Ellen defended their friendship, saying, we're all different and I think that we've forgotten that that's OK that we're all different.</p><p>So in that spirit, we'd like you to tell us about a friendship that you've had that would surprise us and what impact it's had on you and your beliefs.</p><p>Secretary Castro, let's begin with you.</p><p>[22:45:00]</p><p>CASTRO: Well, first of all, thank you to Marc, thank you, Anderson, and thank you, Erin, and CNN, and New York Times and everybody who is here tonight.</p><p>You know, some of the most interesting friendships that I've had have been with people different from me, either people older than me that had a lot to teach me, or people who grew up very different from me. Also, teachers, as I was growing up, people that had a life experience that when I was growing up was beyond mine.</p><p>And sometimes also -- and this goes to the heart of your question, I think -- people who thought differently from me, folks that I considered and have considered friends, and I think that there's a value to that. I think that that should be reflected more in our public life.</p><p>I also believe, to just speak about the incident last week with Ellen and George W. Bush, I completely understood what she was saying about being kind to others. I believe that we should be more kind to other folks.</p><p>I also believe that we should hold people to account for what they've done, especially public servants who have a record of having done something or not done something. And I think that we can do both of those things. I think that we can be kind to people and also hold them accountable for their actions.</p><p>And there are people, whether it's our former president, George W. Bush, or others that should be held accountable. Just as we should be kind, we shouldn't be made to feel shameful about holding people accountable for what they've done.</p><p>COOPER: Congresswoman Gabbard?</p><p>GABBARD: Thank you. You know, where I come from in Hawaii, many of you know, we greet each other with \"aloha.\" It's not a word that means hello and goodbye. It actually means something much more powerful than that. It means I come to you with respect and a recognition that we're all connected, we're all brothers and sisters, we're all God's children.</p><p>So I've developed friendships that some people may be surprised about within the Washington circles, especially, with Republicans, like Trey Gowdy, for example. He and I disagree a lot and very strongly on a lot of political issues. We've developed a friendship that's based on respect. And he's been there for me during some personally challenging times.</p><p>The challenge before us today is that our country is very divided. Donald Trump must be defeated. But we must do more than just defeat Donald Trump. We need to deliver a win for the American people. We must stand united as Americans, remembering that we are all brothers and sisters, that we are all connected. This is the kind of leadership that I seek to bring as president, inspired by the example of presidents like Abraham Lincoln, who talked about how we should have malice for none and charity for all.</p><p>When I look out at our country, I don't see deplorables, I see fellow Americans, people who I treat with respect, even when we disagree and when we disagree strongly. I will work to restore a White House that represents light and compassion and respect for every American regardless of race, religion, orientation, gender, or political affiliation.</p><p>So I want to ask everyone to join me. Join me in bringing about this government of, by, and for the people that serves all the people of this country. You can visit my website, tulsi2020.com, for more information.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Congresswoman.</p><p>Senator Klobuchar?</p><p>KLOBUCHAR: For me, it's John McCain, and I miss him every day. I traveled all over the world with him. And he would sometimes, when we were seated with world leaders, and they would look away from me, he'd say, \"Senator Klobuchar is the lead Democrat on this trip, and she will go next.\"</p><p>And I still remember being there at his ranch. John and I went to visit him and Cindy when he was dying. And he pointed to some words in his book, because he could hardly talk. And the words says this: \"There is nothing more liberating in life than fighting for a cause larger than yourself.\"</p><p>That's what we're doing right now. And while we have had major debates about policy, we have to remember that what unites us is so much bigger than what divides us. And we have to remember that our job is to not just change policy, but to change the tone in our politics, to look up from our phones, to look at each other, to start talking to each other, because the way we win -- and not just win the presidency, but take back the U.S. Senate -- is by winning big.</p><p>And the way we win big is with that fired up Democratic base that's out there today, but it is also about bringing in independents and moderate Republicans. I can lead this. And I ask you to join me because I've done it before and I will do it again, amyklobuchar.com. Join our team. Thank you.</p><p>COOPER: Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Mr. Steyer, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>STEYER: So I'm friends with a woman from Denmark, South Carolina, named Deanna Berry, who's fighting for clean water and environmental justice in her community. [22:50:00]</p><p>She's a different gender. She's a different race. She's from a different part of the country. But she reminds me of my parents in terms of her courage and her optimism and her honor.</p><p>My mother was a schoolteacher in the New York Public Schools and in the Brooklyn House of Detention. My father was the first generation in his family to go to college. My grandfather was a plumber. He interrupted his law degree to go into the Navy in World War II and he ended up prosecuting the Nazis at Nuremberg. And when I asked him what that experience meant, he said, when you see something wrong in your society, you fight it from the first day and every single day after.</p><p>And that's why I started the Need to Impeach movement two years ago, because there was something terribly wrong at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. And over 10 years ago, I saw that there was a terrible threat to the safety and health of every American in terms of the climate crisis. And I've been fighting those companies with the help of the American people ever since successfully, and that's why I'm running for the president, because our government has failed, it's been bought by corporations, and it's absolutely essential to return power to the people.</p><p>I have been doing exactly what my parents taught me to do, which is to take on the biggest problems in America directly and fight for them every single day.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Steyer.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Congressman O'Rourke?</p><p>O'ROURKE: I've always tried to bring people in to the solutions that we have to our common challenges, regardless of the differences. I did that as a small-business owner more than 20 years ago, making sure that we could get a small tech company off the ground in El Paso, Texas.</p><p>Did it as a member of the City Council, where I saw my colleagues not as Republicans or Democrats, but my fellow El Pasoans who had a responsibility to deliver for our community.</p><p>As a member of Congress, I remember being in San Antonio. I was visiting the V.A. there, March of 2017. Found that my flight had been snowed in, in Washington, D.C. I happened to be in the elevator with a Republican member of Congress, Will Hurd. And on a whim, I said, do you want to just rent a car and drive from San Antonio to Washington?</p><p>And he called my bluff. We got in that Chevy Impala, last car on the lot. It was spring break. Drove 1,600 miles across the country. Live streamed the conversation, a Republican and a Democrat finding out what we had in common.</p><p>By the end of that trip, not only had we formed a friendship, but we had formed trust. We worked with each other on each other's bills. I got Will to work with me on an immigration bill, showing party leaders from either side that Republicans and Democrats could work together on an otherwise contentious issue.</p><p>And then across Texas, I mentioned winning more votes than any Democrat. We won independents and Republicans in record numbers, as well. I will bring people in and together to face the common challenges that we have and to make sure that America rises to this opportunity.</p><p>COOPER: Senator Booker, tell us about your most surprising friendship.</p><p>BOOKER: Well, look, I have so many, I don't even know where to count. I was the mayor of a large city with a Republican governor. He and I had to form a friendship, even though I can write a dissertation on our disagreements. When I got to the United States Senate, I went there with the purpose of making friendships across the aisle.</p><p>I go to Bible study in Chairman Inhofe's office. He and I pass legislation together to help homeless and foster kids. I went out to try to invite every one of my Republican colleagues to dinner. And let me again say, finding a dinner at a restaurant, agreeing on one with Ted Cruz was a very difficult thing. I'm a vegan, and he's a meat- eating Texan.</p><p>But I'll tell you this right now, this is the moment in America that this is our test. The spirit of our country, I believe in the values of rugged individualism and self-reliance, but think about our history. Rugged individualism didn't get us to the Moon. It didn't beat the Nazis. It didn't map the human genome. It didn't beat Jim Crow. Everything we did in this country big.</p><p>And, Vice President, we have done so many big things. The fact that there's an openly gay man, a black woman, all of us on the stage are because we in the past are all inheritors of a legacy of common struggle and common purpose.</p><p>This election is not a referendum on one guy in one office. It's a referendum on who we are and who we must be to each other. The next leader is going to have to be one amongst us Democrats that can unite us all, not throw elbows at other Democrats that are unfair, because the preparation is being the leader that can revive civic of grace in our country, teach us a more courageous empathy, and remind America that patriotism is love of country, and you cannot love your country unless you love your fellow countrymen and women.</p><p>And love is not sentimentality. It's not anemic. Love is struggle. Love is sacrifice. Love is the words of our founders who said at the end of the Declaration of Independence that if we're ever going to make it as a nation, we must mutually pledge to each other...</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: ... our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor. I am running for president to restore that sacred honor.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>BOOKER: And if you believe in that like I do, please join me by going to corybooker.com. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator. Mr. Yang?</p><p>YANG: First, I want to thank all the voters tuned in at home.</p><p>[22:55:00]</p><p>And if you don't feel like you answered your -- you got your question answered tonight, it's understandable. There are 12 of us.</p><p>I'm going to be answering voter questions for 10 straight hours this Friday. My web site, yang2020.com. And if you ask your question tonight, there's a better chance I'll get to it.</p><p>My surprising friendship, it's been so much fun running for president, because I've gotten to meet so many Americans I never would have gotten to meet otherwise. The friendship that sticks out for me is a guy named Fred, who's an avid Trump supporter, a trucker. He let me ride in his truck for hours. He spent some time in jail. I heard about his experiences trying to get other people off of drugs.</p><p>And I'm happy to say that, after our ride together, he actually said that he would move from Donald Trump to my campaign, which was a thrill for me. And we remained in touch ever since.</p><p>The truth is that what happened to the 4 million manufacturing workers here in Ohio and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Iowa did not care about our political party. The fourth industrial revolution is now migrating from manufacturing workers to retail, call centers, transportation, as well as to white-collar workers like attorneys, pharmacists, and radiologists. It does not care about our party.</p><p>Donald Trump had a set of solutions in 2016. What did he say? He said we're going to build a wall, we're going to turn the clock back, we're going to bring the old jobs back. America, we have to do the opposite of all of these things. We have to turn the clock forward. We have to accelerate our economy and society as quickly as possible. We have to evolve in the way we think about ourselves and our work and our value. It is not left. It is not right. It is forward. And that is where we must take the country in 2020.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Mr. Yang, thank you very much. Senator Harris?</p><p>HARRIS: Thank you. Probably Rand Paul. He and I -- actually, I invited him to join me on a bill to end the money bail system in the United States. He and I agree on almost nothing, but we agree on that. And after we joined forces, he said to me, \"Kamala, you know, Appalachia loves this.\" And it really made the point that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And I guess that's why I'm running. I do believe that to beat Donald Trump, but also to heal our country, we need a leader who has the ability to unify our country and see that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.</p><p>And I'll tell you, my mother was 19 when she left India alone. And she wanted to travel to learn science because her mission in life was to cure cancer. And so she arrived in California. She got -- you know, she was supposed to have an arranged marriage, but she got involved in the civil rights movement, she met my father, and that produced my sister and me. They got married. But when I was five, that marriage ended.</p><p>But my mother convinced us that we could do anything. And so I became the first woman attorney general of California, the second black woman elected to the United States Senate, and I will tell you, that's part of why I'm running, because Donald Trump, if he had his way, my story would not be possible. And I am running to make sure that that dream, the American dream, American values, American ideas will always hold true.</p><p>And so that's what is at stake in this election. And I believe I am uniquely able to see the commonalities among us and to speak the story of the American dream and the need to reclaim it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Harris. Mayor Buttigieg?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: Well, I think about the friendships that I formed in the military, people who were radically different from me, different generation, different race, definitely different politics. And we learned to trust each other with our lives.</p><p>When they got into my vehicle and when we went outside the wire, they didn't care if I was going home to a boyfriend or a girlfriend, they didn't care what country my dad immigrated from and whether he was documented or not. We just learned to trust each other.</p><p>In fact, the fact that I want every American to have that experience without having to go to war to get there is one of the reasons why I believe national service is so important. I guess I'll follow in the pattern tonight and point out you can go to peteforamerica.com and read all about it.</p><p>It's also about building a sense of belonging in this country, because I think that's what friendship and that's what service can create. And I think we have a crisis of belonging in this country that is helping to explain so many of our problems, from our politics being what it is to the fact that people are self-medicating and we're seeing a rise in the deaths from despair.</p><p>I believe only the president can build a sense of belonging and purpose for the entire country. The purpose of the presidency is not the glorification of the president. It is the unification of the American people. And I'm asking for your vote to be that president, when the dust clears over the rubble of our norms and institutions at the end of the Trump presidency, pick up the pieces and guide us toward a better future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Mr. Mayor, thank you. Senator Sanders?</p><p>[23:00:00]</p><p>SANDERS: When I was chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, I tried to get through the most comprehensive piece of veterans legislation in modern American history. And I failed. I only had two Republicans to vote with me in the Senate. So we had to go back to the drawing board.</p><p>And I worked with John McCain. I certainly did not get in that legislation working with McCain all that I wanted. But it turned out that we were able to pass a very, very significant piece of legislation, including $5 billion more for the Veterans Administration.</p><p>More recently, I worked with a very conservative Republican from Utah, Mike Lee. And Mike understood, although he and I disagree on everything, that the U.S. involvement in the Saudi-led war in Yemen was a catastrophic disaster for the people of Yemen. And for the first time in 45 years, we were able to get the War Powers Act utilized and get U.S. -- get the votes to get the U.S. troops out of that area.</p><p>But I think, at the end of day, what I appreciate is that we have got to end the hatred that Trump is fostering on our people, the divisiveness, trying to divide us up by the color of our skin or where we were born or our sexual orientation or our religion.</p><p>And there is no job that I would undertake with more passion than bringing our people together around an agenda that works for every man, woman, and child in this country rather than the corporate elite and the 1 percent. A progressive agenda that stands for all is the way that we transform this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Senator Sanders, thank you. Senator Warren?</p><p>WARREN: You ask about a surprising friend. For me, it would be Charles Fried. Twenty-seven years ago, when I was under consideration for a job, he was someone who had been George Bush, the first, solicitor general, a deeply principled Republican.</p><p>And we didn't agree on much. I was far more liberal than he was. But he also was willing to listen to my work about what's happening to America's middle class. And Charles engaged with it over and over and ultimately is the person who made sure I got the job.</p><p>You know, I grew up out in Oklahoma. I have three elder brothers. They all served in the military. Two of the three are still Republicans. I love all three of my brothers. And there are a lot of things that we're divided on, but there are core things that we believe in together.</p><p>We want to see all of our children get a good start in life. We don't want to see any of our friends or neighbors not get covered by health care. We're willing to get out there for the things we believe in.</p><p>Look, people across this country, whether they're Democrats, independents, or Republicans, they know what's broken. They know that we have an America that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner and thinner slice at the top and leaving everyone else behind.</p><p>People across this country, regardless of party, are ready to say no more, we want an America that works for everyone. 2020 is our moment in history. It is a deep honor to be here, to be in this fight.</p><p>COOPER: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: I know what's broken. I know how to fix it. And we are building a grassroots movement to get it done that includes everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Thank you, Senator Warren. Vice President Biden?</p><p>BIDEN: This is reassuring in the fact that we're all acknowledging that we have to reach across the aisle, get things done. No other way to get anything done in this country.</p><p>The two people maybe would surprise you the most were -- he's been mentioned twice, but John McCain. John McCain worked for me when he worked in the Navy, and he was -- he was my assigned to me to travel around the world. We became close friends. He became very close friends with my wife, Jill. Visited our home. He was there with his children.</p><p>And on his death bed, he asked me to do his eulogy. John, I would say to John, \"John, you didn't see a war you never wanted to fight.\" And he'd say, \"You didn't see a problem you never wanted to solve.\" But he was a great man of principle. He was honorable. He was honorable.</p><p>And one of the things -- that's the reason why I'm running. We have to restore the soul of this country. That's why I'm doing this. In fact, this president has ripped the soul out of this country, divided us in ways that are absolutely outrageous. A liar, he cheats, he does not do anything to promote people generally.</p><p>Secondly, we have to rebuild the middle class. The only way we're going to do that is to be able to reach across the aisle. My dad used to say a job is about a lot more than a paycheck, Joey. It's about your dignity. We have to restore people's dignity.</p><p>And lastly, we have to unite the country, because, folks, it's time we stopped walking around with our heads down. We are better positioned than any country in the world to own the 21st century. So for god's sake, get up. Get up and remember, there is the United States of America. There's nothing, nothing we're unable to do when we decide we're going to do it. Nothing at all. Period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>COOPER: Candidates, thank you. That concludes the fourth Democratic presidential debate. We want to thank Otterbein University for hosting us. Now please stay tuned to CNN for special coverage of tonight's debate with Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>[23:05:57]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019101503CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X91-XRG1-DXH2-62TK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Live Event</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Elizabeth Warren, who is running for US president.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TAPPER: Good evening from Jackson, Mississippi, and welcome to a CNN Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. I'm Jake Tapper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are live at Jackson State University, a historically black university founded in 1877 for the first major Democratic 2020 event in the state of Mississippi. We're here with Senator Warren, a former special needs teacher and law professor who made her name fighting the big banks. If elected, she would make history as the first female president of the United States of America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Senator Warren will take questions from Democrats and independents who say they plan to participate in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. Please welcome Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: Hey, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER: How are you? Good to see you.</p><p>WARREN: Good to see you.</p><p>TAPPER: Have a seat.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: Oh, this is fun.</p><p>TAPPER: So before we begin, you're a former law professor. Feel good to be back on a campus?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, it always feels good to be back on a campus. Absolutely.</p><p>TAPPER: Which is more fun, teaching law students, teaching on a campus, or working with senators in the U.S. Senate?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, teaching. Are you kidding?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Much more fun.</p><p>TAPPER: I thought you might give that answer.</p><p>WARREN: That's right.</p><p>TAPPER: Let's start with our first town hall question. The first one comes from Christopher Lane. He's a doctoral candidate in public health here at Jackson State University. Christopher?</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, Senator Warren. My question is, Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states in the country, yet many white poor and working-class citizens continue to vote against their economic interests. What message, if any, do you have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to vote for you?</p><p>WARREN: So, thank you for the question, Christopher. Look, this is how I see it. Washington is working great, it's working fabulously for giant drug companies. It's just not working for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for big oil companies that want to drill everywhere. It's just not working for people who see climate change bearing down upon us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for giant financial institutions and for payday lenders. It's just not working great for people who are living paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich and the powerful. I want a Washington that works for the rest of America. That's why I'm in this fight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I believe on that, that Democrats, independents, and Republicans, they know a scam when they see it. And they see a Washington working for those guys. I think they're ready to get in the fight and get a Washington and a country that works for the rest of America. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER: So our next -- our next questioner is Khalita Hicks. She's a supporter of yours and a Spanish language translator from Jackson. Khalita?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Khalita.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening. Since the election of Donald Trump, the number of hate crimes has increased and white supremacists have become more emboldened online and in public. What are your plans to unite the country? WARREN: Oh, good. Thank you for that question. You know, it starts with the fact that we've got to recognize the threat posed by white nationalism. White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist group, like ISIS, like Al Qaida.</p><p>And leadership starts at the top. And that means you've got to call it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No sitting by. And then when you call it out, as president of the United States, you've got to use the tools available to you. And that means get the Justice Department when they break the law to go after them with full prosecution. That's what I can do. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you. Good question.</p><p>TAPPER: Our next question comes from Georgia Cohran. She's a graduate student here at Jackson State University. Georgia?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, thank you, Senator Warren, for taking my question.</p><p>TAPPER: Got to hold the mike up there.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you so much for taking my question. I am an African- American female with -- I'm an African-American female with five beautiful adult children and 10 grandchildren.</p><p>WARREN: Oh, Georgia, count your blessings every day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION: Please, please, describe to me what a public apology to -- for 400 years of free labor...</p><p>WARREN: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: ... in the South, especially Mississippi, will look like in the African American community in the new election.</p><p>WARREN: All right, thank you, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION: In the new administration.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom, and on the backs of slave labor. This is a stain on America, and we're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until we address it head on, directly. (APPLAUSE)</p><p>And make no mistake: It's not just the original founding. It's what's happened generation after generation. The impact of discrimination handed down from one to the next means that today in America, because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination, we live in a world where for the average white family has $100, the average black family has about $5.</p><p>So I believe it's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what's right and begin to heal. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Senator, if I could just follow up on -- if I could just follow up on Georgia's question, you've said you're open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and also to Native Americans, you also said. Might that include direct payments, direct financial transfer of money?</p><p>WARREN: So there are a lot of ways to think about how reparations should be formed. And I noticed, Georgia's question actually started with just the frame of an apology, right, with the frame of a national recognition.</p><p>We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists who have a whole lot of different approaches to it. And I think the best we can do right now -- I love the idea of this congressional commission. Let's bring people together and let's open that conversation as Americans. Let's see what ideas people want to put on the table, and let's talk them through, because I got to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Let me bring in Jay Kucia. He's a supporter of yours, as well. He's a student who founded a labor rights group at the University of Mississippi Law School. That's in Oxford, I believe.</p><p>WARREN: Right.</p><p>TAPPER: He has a question about Medicare for all. Jay?</p><p>WARREN: All right.</p><p>QUESTION: Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here this evening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care. As a supporter of universal health care and an advocate for organized labor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of private health insurance...</p><p>WARREN: Oh, yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: ... that would eliminate the private health employer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for. Can you explain how Medicare for all would be better for workers than simply improving the Affordable Care Act?</p><p>WARREN: OK, so it's a good question. Let's start with our statement that we should make every time we start to talk about changes in our health care, and that is health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate that your question starts with the Affordable Care Act. Let's all remember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start where we are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expand health care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody is covered. Republicans right this minute are out there trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They've got a lawsuit pending down in Texas where they're trying to roll it back. What they couldn't do with a vote, they're trying to do with the courts. HHS every day is doing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>So when we're talking about health care in America right now, the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the Affordable Care Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Then part two. Let's make the improvements that are what I think of as low-hanging fruit. For example, let's bring down the cost of prescription drugs all across this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We got lots of ways we can do that. We can import drugs from Canada where the safety standards are the same. That would cut costs dramatically. We can negotiate the prices under Medicare. That would cut costs dramatically.</p><p>And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on generic drugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions. So let's get those costs down.</p><p>And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumer advocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companies accountable. And that means no tricking and trapping people on those insurance contracts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure everybody gets covered. And some folks are talking about let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55, 50. That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful, for example, to the labor's plans.</p><p>Some people say, do it the other way. Let's bring it up from -- everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare. Others say let employees be able to buy into the Medicare plans. Others say let's let employees buy into the Medicare plans.</p><p>For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this, that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on their own, everybody comes to the table together. And we figure out how to do Medicare for all in a way that makes sure that we're going to get 100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost for everyone. That's our job.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You like that?</p><p>TAPPER: If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question, so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all bill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths to universal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored would essentially eliminate private insurance. Is that something you could support?</p><p>WARREN: He's got a runway for that. I think we get everybody together. And that's what it is, we'll decide. I've also co- sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use. But what's really important to me about this is we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center is about making sure that every single person in this country gets the coverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford. We start with our values, we'll get to the right place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: So, theoretically, though, there could be a role for private insurance companies under President Warren?</p><p>WARREN: There could. Or there could be a temporary role. Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's -- look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got to stay covered. It's critical.</p><p>TAPPER: Let me bring in Kari Johnson. She's a high school principal in Canton, Mississippi. Kari?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Kari.</p><p>QUESTION: Hello, Senator Warren, and thank you for coming.</p><p>WARREN: I'm glad to be here.</p><p>QUESTION: Obviously, building a wall will not prevent foreigners from crossing on U.S. land.</p><p>WARREN: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: What will you do -- what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants?</p><p>WARREN: OK. So let me just start where I think of our whole immigration policy, and that is, we need to have policies on immigration that are consistent with our values.</p><p>We are a country that is built on our differences. That is our strength, not our weakness. And when people come to the United States because they are fleeing terror in Central America, they fear for their lives, then we have a moral responsibility to listen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... and to be there. You know, if I can just take a minute to say on this one, I went down to the border last year when the word first began to come out about children taken away from their mothers. And I just want you all to envision this.</p><p>Think of a big, old Amazon warehouse, only dirty and smelled bad. And when I walked in on my left were cages, maybe 10 feet wide, 40 feet deep, a toilet back in the corner, one after another after another crammed full of men. On the right, one after another after another crammed full of women. And then you walk into the main area, and there were cages about the size of this central area here with nothing but little girls in it. And over there, nothing but little boys.</p><p>That's not who we are. That is not the country we want to be. And an immigration system that is administered so that it is not able to tell the difference between a criminal, a terrorist, and a 12-year-old little girl is an immigration system that not only is not keeping us safer, it does not reflect our values.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I will not support the building of a wall that does not make us safer. The administration itself, people within it, have already said this is not about security, this is not how we're going to make ourselves safer. The kind of wall that is proposed now is a monument to hate and division. We are a better country than that. So, I'll just stop there. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: So, Senator, just to follow up, so Kari's specific question was what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants.</p><p>WARREN: So -- I should hit both of those. You're exactly right. One thing we can do is remember all the tools in the toolbox. And that is, when there's a problem in Central America, because the gangs have taken over, because the local officials can't manage, then that's not a point at which we should be cutting our aid. If we want to stop the problem of mamas fleeing for their lives, then let's make a little more investment in the areas that are troubled. And let's help people be able to stay where they are safely.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's a much kinder way to do it.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Paul Buckley. He's a high school history teacher from Jackson. Paul?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, how are you, Paul?</p><p>QUESTION: Doing well. Good evening. Welcome to Mississippi.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: So, Senator, conservatives are increasingly using the socialist label as a means of attack. So how and to what degree with your policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance, offering financially challenged Americans a hand up, but not a handout?</p><p>WARREN: So, you know, this one really -- this is just a reminder that folks can say whatever they want, but the reality is, at least for me, I believe in markets and I believe in the value that we get out of markets. But it's got to be markets with rules. You know, market without rules is theft.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But a market with rules, a market with rules, a market with a cop on the beat to enforce those rules, that's how it is that small businesses get a chance to start and to grow. That's how it is that employees get to move from one place to another. That's how it is that we get new products. I'm a supporter of markets with rules.</p><p>And what's wrong right now in Washington is the big folks, they don't want rules.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>These giant corporations, they just want to be able to run over whoever they want to run over. And if that means run over their own employees, then, by golly, they'll do it. If that means run over their customers, by golly, they'll do it. If that means running over their local communities, by golly, they will do it.</p><p>So the way I see this is we not only need a government that's on our side with these rules. We need big, systemic change. And that means we need more balance out there in the marketplace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you, real quick, a couple of ways we can do that. The first one is, we need for employees to have more power, and that means we need to make it easier to join a union and unions need to have more power once people have joined.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Unions built America's middle class. Unions will rebuild America's middle class. That's how we make it happen. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: And we should note, you're here in Mississippi, you're focusing on housing for people who are struggling. You have a plan to try to tackle that. You say it's going to help lower rent. How does that work?</p><p>WARREN: So I have a proposal to build about 3 million new housing units across America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I just want to stop for a second. Anybody in here worry about the rise price of housing? Right? Yeah, that's pretty much everybody, right?</p><p>The idea is that we need to make a real investment in housing. In the same way that we think about health care as a basic human right, having a decent and safe place to live should be a basic human right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And the squeeze is everywhere. It's the poor, it's the working poor, it's the working class, it's the middle class, shoot, it even kind of moves up into the upper middle class, that people feel squeezed on housing, because we just don't have enough affordable housing across this country.</p><p>So I believe what we should do is we should make a big investment in housing. And by the way, if we do that, independent analysis from Moody's says that we would lower rents across this country by about 10 percent -- that's across the board -- and we'd create an opportunity for more people to become buyers.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So housing is important. And if I can, Jake, I want to tell you about one other part of this. This bill also addresses the black-white gap in housing that comes from generation after generation, not just a passive discrimination, but realize that into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families. That's red- lining.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>This bill tackles that head on. And it says for people who are living in formally red-lined areas, there's going to be special assistance for first-time homebuyers, for people who got cheated in the run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, some special assistance for folks to be able to get that first home and to start building the generation after generation of wealth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's a step in the right direction.</p><p>TAPPER: We're going to take a very quick break. We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>TAPPER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campus of Jackson State University.</p><p>We're going to go to the questioners in a second, but before we do, I do want to ask a little bit about your personal story, because voters nationwide are just getting to know you. You grew up in Oklahoma.</p><p>WARREN: I did.</p><p>TAPPER: And you've talked about how your family stood at the brink...</p><p>WARREN: There's one.</p><p>TAPPER: One person from Oklahoma.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WARREN: There we go.</p><p>TAPPER: Welcome to Mississippi. So you talked about how your family stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good part of your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?</p><p>WARREN: So, I'll tell you about that. So I have three older brothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was their ticket to America's middle class.</p><p>I was the late-in-life baby. My mother always just called me \"the surprise.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heart attack, and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The church neighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time.</p><p>He survived, but he couldn't go back to work. And we lost our family's station wagon. And at night, I'd hear my parents talk, and that's where I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" And I remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and laying out on the bed is the dress.</p><p>And some people here will know the dress. It's the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. And my mother is in her slip, and she's stocking feet, and she's pacing back and forth, and she's crying. She's saying, \"We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified.</p><p>And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.</p><p>Anybody who wants to know me has just heard this story. But here's the thing for me now. For a long time, I used to think that was just a story about my mother, how when you get scared, you reach down and you find what you have to find and you bring it up.</p><p>And then, years later, I came to understand this is a story about millions of Americans, who -- it doesn't matter if you're scared. When you got to do something to take care of people you love, you reach down, you find it, and you pull it up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then it was years later that I came to understand it was also a story about government, because when this happened to my family, the minimum wage in America would support a family of three. It would take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on the table.</p><p>Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. I am in this fight...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... because I believe that is wrong.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, it's -- for me, there's the whole story of why I'm in this fight. Washington once asked the question, at least on minimum wage, what does it take to support a family, to get a little toe in the door? Today, I hear them in Washington. They ask, what will improve the profitability of giant multinational banks?</p><p>Well, I want a government that doesn't work for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for little families like mine.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Latoya Hubbard. She works for a defense contracting firm here in Mississippi. Latoya?</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening.</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Latoya.</p><p>QUESTION: Do you have any plans of relieving federally funded, overwhelming student loan debt burdens, in that many middle-class and poor individuals obtained those loans to create a better future, but are having issues doing that?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: Oh, Latoya, the answer is yes. I have got plans to reduce student loan debt. Let me just start there.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, there are parts of this that are so personal. I've had one dream since I was in second grade. There's just one thing I wanted to be. All three of my brothers went off and joined the military, and God bless them. Do you know what I wanted to be? I wanted to be a public schoolteacher from the time I was in second grade. Can we hear it for America's public schoolteachers? Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But you've got to have a four-year diploma to do that. And by the time I graduated high school, my family didn't have the money for a college application, much less to send me off to school. And I have a long and twisty story, got a scholarship, then I fell in love...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... got married, the first time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And I thought I'd lost it all. I thought I was -- I thought I had given up on that dream. And I found a commuter college, public college, that cost $50 a semester. And that was my ticket. And I became a special needs teacher. I got to live my dream.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So let me just say, I believe in what we can do through education. But if America wants to be a stronger country, America wants to be a country of real opportunity for everyone, then that means that every kid has a right to get an education without getting crushed by student loan debt, period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: While we're on the subject -- while we're on the subject of education, our next question has to do with the place we're standing in right now, a historically black university.</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Kathy Johnson. She works in banking in Ridgeland, Mississippi. Kathy?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Kathy.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Senator Warren. Being a graduate of a historically black college and university, I see firsthand how we are the first to lose funding or to have budget cuts.</p><p>WARREN: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: How would you make it a priority that we receive more funding and being able to compete with non-historically black colleges and universities?</p><p>WARREN: All right. So, great question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I believe in HBCUs. I just want to say, I am the proud recipient of a diploma that was granted to me at Morgan State University, so...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>As part of their commencement address. So, let me put it this way. What we've got to do is we've got to be willing to invest more in our colleges and universities across the board. We have got to bring down the cost of an education.</p><p>And for the schools that are serving the students who often come from -- first time to come to college, from families that struggle more, then that means we've got to double down and double down a second time to make sure they have the resources they need.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's not enough just for somebody to stand here and talk about it generally. I want you to know, I get this one. Right now, in America, African American students are more likely to have to borrow money to go to college. They're more likely to borrow more money. And they are more likely to have trouble paying off that debt when they leave college. That is a national disgrace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And part of dealing with our student loan debt burden needs to focus on that specifically. So, thank you. It's a good question. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Brennan Breeland. He's a lawyer and an officer in the Army Reserves. Brennan?</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, Senator.</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Brennan.</p><p>QUESTION: How do you respond to people who think that, regardless of the underlying facts, the way you handled the question of your Native American heritage was tone-deaf, offensive, and indicative of a lack of presidential tact?</p><p>WARREN: Well, you know, I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned about my family from my family. And based on that, that's just kind of who I am. And I do the best I can with it. You know, there was an investigation. Nothing I ever did or my family played any role in any job I ever got.</p><p>But I'll tell you this. I have now done 38 town halls in Massachusetts last year, and this is my 32nd town hall since January. And what I've discovered is that people care a lot about what's happening to their lives every single day and what touches them, like housing and education and health care. That's the kind of reason that I'm in this fight. And I'm going to stay in this fight.</p><p>And I'll tell you this. I'm going to fight it from the heart every inch of the way. I'll do my best.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: The next question comes from Rukia Lumumba. She's a legal advocate and community organizer here in Jackson. She also happens to be the sister and former campaign manager of Jackson's current mayor. Chokwe Antar Lumumba, her late father, Chokwe Lumumba, was also once the mayor of this city, as well. Rukia?</p><p>QUESTION: All right. Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Good to see you.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Thank you for being here. Welcome to Jackson, Mississippi. Yeah. So voter disenfranchisement is real. In Mississippi, there are 23 felonies that once convicted ban a person from voting for the rest of their lives, literally limiting their citizenship and right to democracy. Moreover, residents' access to voting is limited by archaic voter registration processes and limited voting formats. How will you expand voting rights to the formerly incarcerated, ensure online voter registration, and non-excuse early voting?</p><p>WARREN: All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great question. But can I go you one bigger?</p><p>QUESTION: Yeah.</p><p>WARREN: And that is, I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure that vote gets counted.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to put some federal muscle behind that. And we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there right now.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you one more. We need to make sure that every vote counts. And, you know, I want to -- I want to push that right here in Mississippi, because I think this is an important point. You know, come a general election, presidential candidates don't come to places like Mississippi.</p><p>QUESTION: That's right.</p><p>WARREN: Yeah. They also don't come to places like California and Massachusetts, right? Because we're not the \"battleground states.\" Well, my view is that every vote matters. And the way we can make that happen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... is that we can have national voting. And that means get rid of the Electoral College and everybody counts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: I want to...</p><p>WARREN: I think everybody ought to have to come and ask for your vote. What do you think? Yeah.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Hannah Burnell Williams from here in Jackson. She's hoping to go to graduate school. Hannah?</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Hannah.</p><p>QUESTION: Recently, many leaders in our nation have taken a stance on whether or not Confederate symbols should remain in the public eye in many of our cities, towns, and parks. As a presidential hopeful, do you have any plans on addressing the removal or lack thereof, of the reminders of this nation's dark past or have any plans on preserving the nation's history in a way that explains it in a more educational sense versus showing praise to the losing side?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: All right. You put it right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, I would support removing Confederate celebrations from federal lands and putting them in museums where they belong. That's right. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Let me follow up, if I can, because Mississippi is the only state in the country that still has the Confederate battle emblem on the state flag. Do you think Mississippi should adopt a new flag? WARREN: Yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: That was the shortest answer I've ever gotten from a politician in my life. We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're living in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>WARREN: All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall. We're here with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson State University in Mississippi.</p><p>In 2018, Jackson, Mississippi, had it highest homicide rate in more than 20 years, with 84 murders. According to local media, it's among the highest murder rates in the country. On that topic, I want to bring in Arreone Hill. She's an accountant for the office of the state treasurer. Arreone?</p><p>QUESTION: Hi. With Jackson, Mississippi, having a very high homicide rate, will there be any revisions to gun control to help ensure less killings throughout the metropolitan city?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: So here's how I look at this. Laws should reflect our values. Laws are about our morals. And right now, across this country, we lose on average seven children and teenagers every single day to gun violence. Just pause for a minute and think, if we were losing seven children every single day to some mysterious virus, man, we'd be pulling out all the stops to say what can we do to change that, where's the medicine we need to develop, how can we respond, what do we need to do?</p><p>But instead, with gun violence, right now we don't do anything, not even the most sensible kinds of things, background checks...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... at the federal level. No fly, no buy. Like if you're on the terrorist watch list, maybe you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That weapons of war do not belong on our streets.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No bump stocks to make it easier to kill. No.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>There's so much that we could do to improve safety for our children and for all of us, things that people agree with who are gun-owners and things that people agree with who are not gun-owners. And we have to do them at a federal level, because the problem is, even if you change your laws right here in Mississippi, if they don't change their laws in the other states, if they still have the gun show loopholes, somebody can just go there, put it in the back of a pickup, and come on down.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So this is a national problem. It goes back to the question I've been talking about, who does government work for? Right now, it works for the wealthy and the well-connected, and that means we have a federal government being held hostage by the NRA. I believe we can fight back and we can change that together.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Senator, let me bring in Samantha Manning. She works here at Jackson State University as an administrative assistant in the Disabilities Services Department. Samantha?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Samantha.</p><p>QUESTION: Hello. As a mother of black boys, I am constantly reminded of a judicial system where the scales are often weighed against them, and those that have sworn to protect them, fear them, and are most often ruled justified in excessive actions against other children who look like them. As president, how would you address the concerns that I and many other parents like me have when it comes to protecting our children and restoring our faith in the judicial system?</p><p>WARREN: So, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I start with the principle, the four words carved above the United States Supreme Court, \"Equal justice under law.\" That's what I believe in.</p><p>But I understand today in America we don't have that.</p><p>QUESTION: Right.</p><p>WARREN: That's right. Race matters, and we need to call it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, I'd like to follow some of the very practical efforts that Barack Obama, President Obama, put into place when he had his Justice Department going after the police departments that were violating the rights of young black men and women across this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) I know there's much to criticize this administration about, but the very fact that the Justice Department under President Obama had worked with police departments around the country -- and they were -- they were not finished, but had worked with, and some had already reached the point of signing consent decrees, of starting new training, of trying to put themselves on a better path.</p><p>There are many good people in law enforcement who want this to work and want to make it work if they have the right resources, if they have the right opportunities, if they can do community policing. That's where President Obama was leading us, and this administration pulled that out of the Justice Department, reversed it, and that makes the world a lot more dangerous for everyone. I would reverse that and go where President Obama went. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Mary Crump. She's a retired nurse from Jackson. Mary?</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you, Senator Warren, for being here. How do you plan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes?</p><p>WARREN: Whoa!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, look, we need big structural change in this country. And that means the kind of -- let's just admit it. When you've got a government that works for the rich and it's not working nearly as well for anyone else, that's corruption, and we need to call it out plain and simple.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So the first thing we need to do is we need to attack that corruption head on. I have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. Big problem, you got to have a big bill to deal with it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, it's got a lot of pieces to it, but the main point is to beat back on the influence of money, because that's how they keep getting this government, getting this country to work for them. So, for example, my bill says we're going to end lobbying as we know it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Lock the revolving door between Main Street -- between Wall Street and Washington.</p><p>I'll give you one more. Everyone who runs for federal office ought to have to put their taxes online, everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, part one, we got to deal with the corruption head on. But let me give you a part two. I was talking earlier about we got to rewrite the rules in this economy. And part of that is putting more power back in the hands of workers. Unions, that's one way to do it. I've got an accountable capitalism bill that says, on the big Fortune 500 companies, that we're going to have employees also sit on the board of directors and help make decisions.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But there's one more we've got to talk about, and that is my ultra- millionaires tax. So the idea is, on the truly great fortunes, $50 million and above, we start charging 2 percent a year on just that $50 millionth and first dollar and on up, 2 percent a year.</p><p>And by the way, anybody in here a homeowner?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You've been paying wealth taxes for a long time. They're just called property taxes. I just want to include the Rembrandt and the diamonds in the property taxes. So...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I'm going to put a wealth tax in place. And I just want to talk to you for one minute about how that restructures our whole economy. We get a 2 percent tax on the 75,000 richest families in this country, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare, universal Pre- K, universal Pre-Pre-K for every child in America, and still have $2 trillion left over. Let's make it happen.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>TAPPER: Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campus of Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.</p><p>I want to bring in Marcy Croft, she is a lawyer from Madison, Mississippi. Marcy?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Marcy.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Hi, Senator. You have proposed breaking up the big tech companies.</p><p>WARREN: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: Is it really possible to increase regulation of private tech companies without stifling innovation?</p><p>WARREN: Oh, good question, Marcy. But here's my point. If you break them up, you actually need less regulation. Because here's how this works right now. Think about the big tech companies -- Amazon, Facebook, Google, right?</p><p>Here's what they do. They run a platform, OK, where people come -- let's just stick with Amazon. That's where you go to check out 63 coffee makers, all of which can be delivered in 24 hours, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And think about this, just so you get an idea of how vast they are right now in our economy. Walmart is about 9 percent of all physical retail sales in America. Amazon, 49 percent of all online. So this is a big deal. If you want to sell online, you're a little guy, you're trying to get your business started, you're an entrepreneur, you've got to be there.</p><p>So Amazon runs this platform. You come to the platform. All sounds great. But Amazon also is collecting information on every single buyer who visits and on every single seller who's there, and on every single transaction. And what it does is it has the capacity to look out there and see, you know, Pete's pet pillows, and say, whoa, Pete had a good idea here. He's making money off this. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to take Pete off page one, move him back to page 16, where nobody goes, and then Amazon Pete Pet Pillows is going to step right in front of him.</p><p>You know, think of it this way like in baseball. You can be an umpire, run the platform, or you can have a team in the game, run one of the businesses competing with the other businesses. But you don't get to do both at the same time.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So here's my pitch. I just want to break those two things apart. I want you still to be able to go and check out all the coffeemakers you want to check out. The platform works. But nobody gets to suck a lot of information off the platform for the purpose of being able to put a bunch of little businesses out of business.</p><p>We want to have more competition in America, break up those tech giants. We can make that work.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: The next question comes from Rodney Smith. He's a lawn maintenance contractor here in Jackson. Rodney?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Rodney.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening. The cities of America have crumbling infrastructure. How would you combat these issues? These are problems that everyone knows about but have failed to do anything about these problems. WARREN: Right. All right, it's a good question. So, look, think of infrastructure this way. I kind of think of it like a farmer plows the fields. We get out there together through our government, and we build the roads and the bridges, we put up the communications system, we do these things together because you can't start a little business and at the same time try to build the road in front of your house, right? So you need all these pieces to make it work. A farmer who does a good job of planting the fields, it means a lot of seeds get to grow and to go forward.</p><p>Now, what's happened in America is that we've cut back on making those infrastructure investments. And you all see it every day. You see it in your lives. You see it when you see roads that are crumbling, bridges that are dangerous. Yeah, you're all seeing this, right?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So understand, it's worse than what you see, because America competes all around the world now. That's just the reality. And right now, here in America, we are spending about 0.6 percent, just a smidge, on our infrastructure. In fact, some people say it's not even enough to replace what's breaking and falling apart. China, by comparison, is spending about 5 percent of its GDP on infrastructure. It is spending eight times more, almost nine times more on its infrastructure.</p><p>It's building a future for those small businesses, for those medium- sized businesses, for those giant businesses. It is building a future for work in China. We need to step up our investment in infrastructure right here in the United States of America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's how we build a future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll add one little piece to it and say, when you take a look at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building the infrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: Let me bring in Maggie Spitz. She works at a public library in Madison, Mississippi. Maggie?</p><p>QUESTION: Hi, thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Hi.</p><p>QUESTION: Presently the state of Mississippi imposes a special tax on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles as a penalty for paying less in gas taxes. Do you believe this is the right approach, considering the warnings about climate change? And what would you propose to encourage the increased use of alternative energy? WARREN: OK. So, can we just start with the issue of climate change? And I want to say something that is very controversial. So, most of you are sitting down. Maggie, is it? You may want to sit down, too, OK, or just hold on to a chair. Because I spend time in Washington. In Washington, this is a very controversial statement: I believe in science.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Climate change is real, it is manmade, and we are running out of runway to be able to fix this problem.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need all hands on deck on this one. So I mentioned earlier, as part of infrastructure, we need to be thinking about infrastructure in terms of hardening our infrastructure against the climate change that's coming our way and in terms of building green energy infrastructure.</p><p>We need to do more, though. We've got to be working in every single direction. More money on research. More money on how we get our vehicles so that we get to a place where we have a sustainable Earth. This is truly the crisis that faces not just our nation, but the world.</p><p>The United States is a world leader. The problem is we are leading in the wrong direction right now on climate.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We've got to go the other way. We've got to show the world what can be done. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER: Senator, I just want to follow up on Maggie's question, because she talked about the gas tax. As you know, the federal gas tax has not been raised...</p><p>WARREN: I know.</p><p>TAPPER: ... since 1993, leaving many states to fend for themselves to maintain the roads and bridges. Would you support, theoretically, raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructure needs?</p><p>WARREN: So, you know, I'll tell you what worries about doing this through gas tax. I'm open to the conversation, but what worries me is it falls hardest on working people. When I talk about raising taxes, what I really want to see is I want to see an ultra-millionaire's tax.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I want to see taxes on the top. And then let's use that to help subsidize what it is that we really want to see: Cleaner vehicles. That's the direction I'd much rather see us go. I want to get us there, but I want to do it the other way.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: The next question comes from Ally Mack, a longtime Jackson resident, who served as the dean of international studies here at Jackson State University. Dean Mack?</p><p>QUESTION: What is your position on the impeachment of Donald Trump?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN: So, we have a report that is due from the special prosecutor any day now. Understand that that investigation from Mr. Mueller has produced already -- I believe it's 34 indictments or guilty pleas. This is a serious investigation. We need to protect him in finishing that report. And then that report needs to be made public to the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>When we get it, we will know what to do with it. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER: Senator Warren, you sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p><p>WARREN: I do.</p><p>TAPPER: I want to introduce you to Daniel Bamrick. He's a U.S. Army veteran who served in Kuwait and Syria who is now a research lab technician. Daniel?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Daniel.</p><p>QUESTION: Hey, Senator. Good evening.</p><p>WARREN: Hi. Thank you for your service.</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you. Your family, too. Big brothers.</p><p>WARREN: All right. Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION: As a veteran, I've seen the amazing capability of our armed forces.</p><p>WARREN: Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION: But I was also shocked to see the lack of clearly defined goals and objectives coming down from the highest level. It also worries me that military service itself is becoming a very uncommon experience...</p><p>WARREN: Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION: ... for the U.S. population at large. So, as president, my question is, what would you do to provide clear, achievable goals for our military and to broaden the participation rate of American citizens in what is their government's largest organization?</p><p>WARREN: Yes. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you for the question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>QUESTION: Thank you.</p><p>WARREN: Look, with three brothers in the military, my oldest one spent more than five years off and on in combat in Vietnam. We were lucky to get him back home. And my second brother was overseas for over a year. My third brother trained as an Army medic. I understand the sacrifices that our military makes and the sacrifices their families make. I stood there every day and watched my mother as she waited for the mail to hear from my brothers.</p><p>We have the best military on Earth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>They will do whatever we ask them to do. They will go out and fight and, if necessary, die for us. But that puts a sacred responsibility on our leadership to understand that, around the world, we cannot use our military to solve non-military problems.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to be willing to use all of the tools in the toolbox, and that means we need to be using our diplomatic tools much stronger. We need to use our economic tools. And we need, when we do feel absolutely pressed to use a military alternative, we need to be clear not just on what our objective is going in, what the measure is of success, but what our plan is to get out on the other side.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We cannot fight endless wars. It's wrong.</p><p>TAPPER: So, Daniel worked in Syria. He served in Syria. You've said it's, quote, \"right to get our troops out of Syria,\" but you did criticize President Trump for failing to plan the withdrawal...</p><p>WARREN: Yes.</p><p>TAPPER: ... with U.S. allies. The U.S. is currently planning to leave 400 or more servicemembers in Syria on what is being called a peacekeeping mission. Would you as president keep any troops on the ground in Syria? And if so, how many?</p><p>WARREN: I think we need to get out. We need to get out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Until someone can identify -- and this is the whole point about it. I ask this in hearings in Armed Services. What is the measure of success? If you're going to be there, describe, let us see so we can tell if you're failing or succeeding at this. And no one can come up with an answer. And until they can do that, we need our troops back home. (APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: I want to bring in Jayda Lee, a public health educator from Jackson. Jada?</p><p>WARREN: Hello, hi, Jayda.</p><p>QUESTION: Hi. Good evening. Mississippi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. Black and brown women make up the majority of those who fall victim to higher rates of pregnancy- related mortality.</p><p>WARREN: Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION: Although some of this disparity can be attributed to lack of access, other issues are less easily explained. How would you administration create legislation to improve outcomes for these women?</p><p>WARREN: So, it is an excellent question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let me tell you something I've already been working on in this area. This is a place where we need not only more funding for the National Institutes of Health to be able to do the research, but we need to insist that the National Institutes of Health is actually doing research and keeping track of male/female, African American/other races, so that we better understand all of what's wrong.</p><p>As you say, we know that part of this is related to lack of access, but that's not explaining everything that's going on. I believe in research. And we've got to support it so that it supports all of our mamas and all of our babies. It's very important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER: Senator, I want to bring in Michael Barber. He's a freshman here at Jackson State University. He says he's currently supporting Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run. Michael?</p><p>WARREN: Hi, Michael.</p><p>QUESTION: Good evening, ma'am. Yeah, my question is we have seen recently kids who have the luxury of parents paying their way into school no matter the GPA. The kids who attend inner city schools do not have that luxury or the resources to excel and they suffer greatly as they become closer to adult life. How would you not only improve, but make the educational system fair for all American people?</p><p>WARREN: All right. So, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, this scandal just shows one more time that some folks who are rich just think they don't have to play by the same set of rules as anyone else and that they can use their money to do whatever it is in terms of buying influence. We have to put a stop to that.</p><p>And it's not just -- it's everywhere now. And we're here talking about a presidential primary. It's everywhere in Washington. You know, I just -- I want to say something about democracy for a minute. I get that we have a lot of differences. There will be some people who have a little more money, some people who have a little less, some people who go further in school, some people who don't. But the one thing we should all own an equal share of is an equal share of our democracy.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need a government that doesn't just listen to the rich and the powerful, but a government that listens to all of us. And that starts right now in a Democratic primary. Something you can ask everyone in the Democratic primary who wants to ask for your vote is to ask them where they've been and how they've gotten their funding.</p><p>Me, I don't take corporate PAC money. In fact, I don't take PAC money of any kind.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't take federal lobbyists' money. And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I don't go behind closed doors with people of money and influence to try to get their help in this election. I come here to be with you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Because I believe that our democracy is really on the ropes. We have a country that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. In 2020, we have a chance to take that back. We have a chance to build a real grassroots foundation, face to face, person to person, neighborhood to neighborhood.</p><p>And if you believe that is how we should be running our presidential primary, I ask you, be part of this. Go to elizabethwarren.com. Be part of this. Make a contribution, volunteer. We're going to have to build this thing ourselves, because democracy is not a machine that will go of itself.</p><p>And government, our government, is not for sale. We need a government that works for the people, and that means the people have to be there as part of it. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: I have one final question for you, Senator. Faith is very important to many people across the country. It's very important to many people in Mississippi. What role does faith play in your life, your public life and your private life?</p><p>WARREN: So I was raised as a Methodist, and...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I was a fifth grade Sunday school teacher. All I can say is, nobody got hurt.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It was a low bar for being a fifth grade Sunday school teacher at our church. And I raised my children in the Methodist church. What it is for me is the importance of the lessons we learn when we remember our values, when we remember our faith.</p><p>The story for me is Matthew 26, and I'm sure some of you -- a lot of you know this story. You know, this is the one where the shepherd is dividing the world into the sheep and the goats. And as we all know, sheep are going to heaven, goats, nah, they're not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And the sheep ask him, why us? Why us, Lord? Why did you pick us? We look like those -- like those guys. And the shepherd, the Lord, answers back by saying, \"I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me water. I was in prison, and you visited me, naked and ye clothed me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.\"</p><p>And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day. The first is there is God, there is value in every single human being.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every single human being. And the second is that we are called to action.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That passage is not about you had a good thought and held onto it, you sat back and were just a part of -- you know, thought about good things. It does not say, you just didn't hurt anybody and that's good enough. No.</p><p>It says, you saw something wrong, you saw somebody who was thirsty, you saw somebody who was in prison.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You saw their face. You saw somebody who was hungry, and it moved you to act. I believe we are called on to act.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER: Our thank you to Senator Elizabeth warren. Thank you, as well, to our audience here and to Jackson State University. Great questions from all of you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Be sure to tune in Wednesday night at 10 p.m. Eastern. Dana Bash will moderate the next CNN Democratic candidate town hall with former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. \"CNN Tonight\" starts right now.</p><p>WARREN: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019031801CNV54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP2-3161-JB20-G28M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Elizabeth Warren, Campaign 2020, Jackson</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Debt Collection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjJFNEUwMDk3RTI3NEMxN0FDMkRBMzNBRDkzOTc5REE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njk4RUMyMDg4ODMwNDIwNUI1NEQwMDE0OUU3REYyOTM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Insurance Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDM4MzQ2QUYzMTY0NDQzQTkxRDQwRUUzRUM5RDg0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURCMkIyODk4NDUwNDQ2NkE3RkQ0Qzg3RUVCOENGQUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTA3MzFBREE5RDkxNEIyNkExMzYyNTkwMEI4ODA2MTQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Public Health &amp;

It was an act of hate targeting Muslim worshippers. In the end, a mass shooting, the worst in this country's history, taking the lives of 49 people; 20 people in critical condition in hospital. Lives still hanging in the balance, including that of a 4-year-old girl in critical condition because of her gunshot wounds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're learning more about the suspect. He appeared in court today. The suspected attacker made his first court appearance. He's an Australian national, 28-year-old. Brenton Tarrant is charged with murder. Additional charges may come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This as investigators pore over his hate-filled manifesto that he initially posted on 8chan and later was available on Twitter. He emailed it, in fact, to the office of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, before launching his attacks on the mosques around 1:40 pm in the afternoon on Friday.</p><p>I'm joined by a resident of Christchurch, Deepak Sharma.</p><p>Deepak, thank you so much for joining us this day. And my sympathies to you and everyone in the community here. You are an immigrant and a proud New Zealander.</p><p>DEEPAK SHARMA, CHRISTCHURCH RESIDENT: Yes, I am.</p><p>STOUT: You have been living here 10 years.</p><p>How do you feel when an attack like this takes place and tries to destroy your community?</p><p>SHARMA: Well, it's a very gruesome atrocity that took place on Friday. There is no way to describe this act of terror. I guess people just need to come together and against this hate and to make sure that we are one nation, all the different cultures. But that is the key point here. It is unity and diversity.</p><p>STOUT: Yes.</p><p>SHARMA: That's the message we need to spread from here. But the lives that were lost were not only 49 people but also 49 families.</p><p>STOUT: Absolutely, devastated families. And the xenophobic nature of attack, we saw the manifesto of the suspected gunman and terrorist. He called immigrants like yourself \"invaders.\"</p><p>How does that make you feel when you hear something like that?</p><p>SHARMA: Well, it hurts. It hurts. A person like me who has been here for the last 10 years, after giving my sweat, life, blood, everything here, if I'm still seen as an invader, I don't know where I should call myself a home.</p><p>Yes, I guess when a person decide to move overseas to call a new place his home, people need to understand they're leaving the luxuries all there, the families, friends, all those memories they spent all their life. They're leaving everything behind for a search of a new place where you can make a new home there.</p><p>When you are going to be there, settle there and someone going to do like this and call you an invader, well, that hurts.</p><p>STOUT: All the people forget that the story of migration is a story of survival and a story of hope.</p><p>SHARMA: I guess New Zealand has been a land of immigration since years. The only difference is that we are (INAUDIBLE) to the people who came here years earlier. I guess that's the only difference.</p><p>And I was thinking all night, what is an immigrant?</p><p>We all are immigrants in this whole world. We all are going to leave sooner or later.</p><p>STOUT: Your thoughts about how New Zealand and the community here at Christchurch as responded.</p><p>SHARMA: I was touched. I was here with my wife yesterday. So we spent a good three, four hours over there. Everyone was in tears. Everyone was shedding the tears. It was very touching to see them. I guess -- we haven't been close enough after this attack but that's not the right time to get together.</p><p>I guess we should have been together since ages. But it is the one offense then I hope won't happen again and we will be together again.</p><p>STOUT: Do you feel the terror attack, as horrible and devastating as it was, has brought your community closer together?</p><p>SHARMA: Yes, yes. I guess it will be test of time and your loyalty here and your support of your community is only tested when you are going to face a time like this. Yes, we have passed the test so far. Everyone was together yesterday. Everyone was coming.</p><p>It was really hard for parents to explain to their younger ones what happened and what to learn from here. I guess that will make the difference.</p><p>STOUT: And Christchurch has been through testing times before, right?</p><p>SHARMA: Yes.</p><p>STOUT: Ten years ago you experienced the earthquake. You were here.</p><p>SHARMA: Yes, I was here.</p><p>[13:05:00]</p><p>STOUT: And, yet, you love Christchurch. You will stay in Christchurch.</p><p>SHARMA: Yes. This is our home. So we're not going to move anywhere from here. But I guess the only thing is this is polarization. People need to understand that this is not just starting in a day. There are wars and ideology that keep running on and on. When some of the parties make statements, like just choose some borders for polarization, I'm not sure where it started from, probably the U.S. because they got influence over the rest of the world.</p><p>It started probably from there or from somewhere but it is out there. We used to listen to the media. It happened in the U.S., Canada. But it was not in my wildest dreams it was going to happen right here in Christchurch close to my place. That was very gruesome.</p><p>STOUT: But this response is so special and so beautiful. Deepak, I'm going to have to leave it at that. Thank you so much for joining us. Great to hear that you will stay.</p><p>Deepak was mentioning just the ideology, the anti-immigrant ideology that was expressed in this suspect's manifesto that was posted on 8chan, circulated on Twitter and on other platforms. Of course it has been well reported how the attack itself was livestreamed on Facebook.</p><p>Even though Facebook took it off its platform, it is already out there for the world to see. Let's focus more on the tech angle with my colleague, Salma Abdelaziz, who joins us from London.</p><p>Salma, it's not just a Facebook problem. It is a big tech problem and social media problem.</p><p>Why is it that when they have all the algorithms, all the human moderators and all the technology, that they can't take this despicable content down?</p><p>SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN PRODUCER: That's absolutely right. As you said, it is usually human moderators and AI online and it is simply not working. Watching this attack unfold was like watching some dystopia of technology gone terribly wrong. We know the attacker spent two years planning this massacre and it seems that much of that planning was centered around social media. Everything from the manifesto to the video to the phrases he uttered were meant to be shareable, something that would spread online at a rate that tech giants simply couldn't stop in time.</p><p>He began by posting pictures online hours before of his weapons with memes and tropes scrawled all over the guns. Then came that 87-page hate-filled manifesto, full, again, of references to Internet subculture. After that, 17 horrific minutes of murder broadcast on Facebook live via body camera.</p><p>Again, that choice of a body camera is significant. It was meant to look like a first-person shooter-style video. Now as you said, Facebook said they acted quickly to take it down. But it wasn't quick enough.</p><p>A day and a half after the attack, I could still easily find that video on YouTube, on Twitter and, even now, I can go online and find people who are glorifying, even uttering the same phrases he shared in that video.</p><p>And now the question is that these groups that once existed in the fringes of the Internet, in some form, in the dark web, now that they're in the mainstream, how can they tackle them?</p><p>How can they stop this message of hate?</p><p>STOUT: It's an open-ended question, whether it's -- they need to better police themselves or more regulations. This is definitely open for discussion. Salma, we thank you for that forensic analysis of technology's role in fueling the hatred behind the attack.</p><p>Joining me now is Alexandra Field, who has been in Christchurch, focusing on the story of the survivors, the people that were there.</p><p>They were witness to terror and they managed to survive.</p><p>What did they tell you?</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they describe a scenario that we can very easily imagine of sitting in their mosques, mosques they had attended for years with members of their community and suddenly either seeing people running and ducking or hearing those initial shots fired.</p><p>We know in these cases there is that moment of total confusion. They described a flurry of shots, people running in different directions. I spoke to two men who talked about just trying to save their lives, trying to protect others.</p><p>One man was able to jump out a window and get outside, another who stayed inside and witnessed the horror as it unfolded. It is hard to imagine, 41 people killed in one of the mosques, seven in another and we're learning now a little bit more about the people who were actually inside, the ones who didn't make it out.</p><p>STOUT: And as you point out, this took place in a mosque, in a place of worship. It should have been a safe place, a place for contemplation. And in New Zealand, no less. These are individuals who are immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers. Tell us more about where they come from.</p><p>FIELD: And the prime minister here --</p><p>[13:10:00]</p><p>FIELD: -- Jacinda Ardern, was really quick to point that out. New Zealand is a country that has such a tiny Muslim population, about 1 percent. She was quick to say that many of the people that were going to be victims of this attack would have been migrants, would have been refugees, who came here looking for a safer place or a better life.</p><p>I spoke to one man from Afghanistan. He had family members who were here as well. He said he left a country that was gripped by war to come to a place he thought he would be safe.</p><p>I spoke to another man from Saudi Arabia, who said he came here for the opportunity to pursue his PhD.</p><p>The victims in this attack came from so many different countries, were compelled to come here. All of them felt that their safety was all but guaranteed in this country, if in any country, really.</p><p>STOUT: How is this event going to change Christchurch?</p><p>We spoke to Deepak Sharma, himself an immigrant, who has been here for 10 years. He said, of course, I'm going to stay. I love Christchurch. He says this is an event, despite how horrific it was, has brought the community closer together.</p><p>Is that what you're hearing also from survivors and members of the community here?</p><p>FIELD: We are seeing people who are immediately coming out and showing support. Because the Muslim community here is so small, you are seeing so many who live in the area, saying they want to come forward and publicly show they are standing with Muslim members of the community, who have made New Zealand their home.</p><p>What's really interesting here is, in the United States, where we see mass shootings happen a lot, you will often hear in the immediate aftermath, you will hear politicians come on TV and say this is a time prayer and not really a time for politics.</p><p>What we saw here was a prime minister who came out very quickly and said the gun laws here will change. That was the commitment she made and that is certainly something we will have to watch in the days and weeks ahead.</p><p>STOUT: That prompted one online commentator, saying thoughts and prayers actually work in New Zealand because it has resulted in gun reform one day after this massacre. Alexandra Field, thank you so much.</p><p>We will continue our ongoing coverage of the aftermath of the terror attacks here in New Zealand. You are watching CNN. We'll be back right after this.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back to our continuing coverage of the New Zealand terror attacks. I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Christchurch.</p><p>PAULINE CHIOU, CNN ANCHOR: And I'm Pauline Chiou in New York. Here are the very latest developments.</p><p>The man accused of carrying out the mosque terror attacks made his first court appearance. Brenton Tarrant remained silent as he was charged with one count of murder. More charges will be filed later.</p><p>Two others are also in custody but their involvement in the attack remains unclear. We are learning that he emailed his manifesto to the prime minister's office minutes before the attack.</p><p>At least 49 people were killed and dozens more wounded in the shootings. Let's bring you up to date on other stories making news this hour.</p><p>[13:15:00]</p><p>CHIOU: The so-called Yellow Vest protests in Paris have turned violent once again. French police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters, who shattered store windows and set a newspaper stand on fire.</p><p>This is the 18th consecutive Saturday of demonstrations against president Emmanuel Macron and his policies.</p><p>Joining us live from Paris is France 24 correspondent Catherine Norris-Trent.</p><p>Catherine, are tensions still high at this hour?</p><p>CATHERINE NORRIS-TRENT, FRANCE 24 CORRESPONDENT: Pauline, yes. The tensions are still running high here in parties. Riot police have been clashing with a hardcore of those demonstrator.</p><p>What is happening right now is that the riot police, several dozen of them here have pushed the rioters back up the avenue there towards the ark. They're trying to get them circled and push them up the streets.</p><p>Throughout this afternoon they have been firing several rounds of tear gas and stun grenades at them. The protesters or rioters have set fire and looted several shops here. We have seen luxury cars set fire, too. And one building went up in smoke, just a couple of blocks from here, which had a bank on the ground floor.</p><p>But people living inside upstairs and firefighters had to rescue a mother and a 9-month-old baby from that building. So very tense scenes indeed.</p><p>CHIOU: Not all protesters have the same agenda. Tell us about some of the groups there on the street and what they're demanding.</p><p>NORRIS-TRENT: Well, it's very difficult to get an overall feel of who exactly the Yellow Vest protesters are because it's been a grassroots movement without any official leadership. None has yet emerged that's proved a consensus at any rate.</p><p>So some of these protesters, it is thought to be hardcore rioters from anarchist groups, from far right-wing, left-wing groups who are unhappy at the political system in general. You have also got many other Yellow Vest demonstrators, who are anti-Emmanuel Macron, who really dislike him and everything he stands for, saying that he is a president of the rich only and that he doesn't represent them and that his tax policies are hitting them hard in the pocket.</p><p>And then you have got still other protesters, who have joined a huge climate march here in Paris. On the other side of town, many Yellow Vest protesters there, too, today marching peacefully, saying more needs to be done about climate change. So it is a really diverse scene and a really diverse group of protesters out on the streets.</p><p>CHIOU: Catherine Norris-Trent, thank you so much for bringing up to date on the situation in Paris.</p><p>Also high tensions in Venezuela, where the standoff continues there. On one side, President Nicolas Maduro and the Venezuelan military.</p><p>On the other, supporters of self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido. And caught in the middle, the people of Venezuela, facing shortages of food, water and power. Our Paula Newton joins us live now from Caracas.</p><p>Paula, on the political front -- you have been there for several weeks now.</p><p>Is either side gaining an upper hand?</p><p>PAULA NEWTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I would say in my judgment not, in fact. We have settled into a many familiar pattern here. In the protests today, first we have the pro-government rally. Those supporting president Maduro are out on the street. And then there is Juan Guaido who has gone to Valencia, a couple of hours west of here, saying to people we need to try to keep the momentum of this opposition movement.</p><p>To do that, he says we need to get to every corner and crevice of the government. At this point in time, you even have U.S. officials acknowledging that, look, this could take some time in terms of getting to resolution. I will add that the last of the U.S. diplomats left on Thursday. That means there is no diplomatic representation here from the U.S. and it's not certain whether or not that will also reach the United States in terms of trying to figure out what's going on on the ground here and really having any kind of a breakthrough.</p><p>I have to say that people here remain quite exhausted and they're quite in a fragile mood, only recovering in the last few days from those power shortages, which led to shortages of other basics like food, water, medicine.</p><p>CHIOU: The situation there continues. Thank you so much, Paula Newton, for bringing us up to date on the picture there on the ground.</p><p>Well, still ahead, the latest on Friday's terror attack in New Zealand and the accused gunman's manifesto.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>[13:20:00]</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Christchurch. Welcome back to our ongoing coverage of the terror attacks here in New Zealand.</p><p>Chilling new details about the suspect, his hateful manifesto he sent out before the shootings took place, which killed 49 people. This is what we learned. The prime minister's office said it received an email containing the suspect's manifesto just minutes before the attacks began on Friday afternoon.</p><p>The document was also posted on social media, on 8chan, on Twitter. Authorities have declined to discuss the gunman's motive for killing dozens of people in Christchurch in two separate mosques on Friday.</p><p>But the diatribe is filled with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rants. Glenn Schoen joins me now from The Hague via Skype. He is a terror analyst.</p><p>Glenn, thank you for joining us. When the government of New Zealand is confronted with what happened on Friday and confronted with the threat posed by far right extremist hate, white supremacist hate, what can be done to combat it?</p><p>GLENN SCHOEN, TERRORISM EXPERT: Well, a whole number of things starting on the (INAUDIBLE) looking at home. The one -- I don't know if we call it an advantage here but, of course, this attack was essentially perpetrated by a foreigner, operating initially from foreign soil, coming to New Zealand and planning the attack there. Obviously, you don't want any form of repeat coming up there whatsoever, whether it's from somebody domestic or somebody foreign.</p><p>But I think for them, in essence, it's positive that this came from abroad rather than something from the inside or involved a big group of people from inside New Zealand.</p><p>Logically speaking, I think what we're going to see is a major effort now across the board, probably not just in New Zealand but other nations and I would assume perhaps Australia as well, where the full scale of looking at the preventive aspect of things, where we're bringing in everybody from community leaders, psychologists and teachers in terms of awareness about radicalization, whether it's radicalization for political extreme beliefs or other forms of radicalization, the work by law enforcement on the preventative side, to look at more monitoring capability and then moving on in the spectrum from there in terms of signaling and monitoring what's going on, on a daily basis.</p><p>STOUT: And in this day and age, radicalization can go viral. So what could be done to prevent a repeat attack, a copycat attack, inspired by the online manifesto or the atrocity livestreamed on Friday?</p><p>SCHOEN: Well, I think a number of things will happen. One is to look specifically at how did this unfold, who is this individual? His radicalization, moving into upcoming activity (ph) to whether people who actually tried to draw him into his beliefs, who reinforced these beliefs or who pushed him towards an action.</p><p>That's going to be a matter of analysis of a lot of things, his work history, his travel history, his personal history and, like you just mentioned, social media, everything virtual.</p><p>Within that virtual domain, there is an awful lot that can be done. But obviously it knows its limits as well. And I think New Zealand and perhaps other countries here will be looking at successful and programs where we don't yet know where they're very successful but which have been tried out in the past three or four years to counteract particularly jihadist extremism. That ranges from request more self-policing by the big companies, the Facebooks and the Twitters --</p><p>[13:25:00]</p><p>SCHOEN: -- to what can law enforcement, what can the community do to early detect and intervene.</p><p>STOUT: Yes. And to address extremism in all its forms, you also need to identify its seductive appeal and how to get rid of that appeal, the seductive appeal of ISIS and white supremacists.</p><p>What makes this type of extremist thinking so alluring?</p><p>And how can we remove that allure?</p><p>SCHOEN: Well, I'm not sure I know how we can remove it but we have seen more successful programs, particularly such as that used by the British government. They know that this is particularly alluring because of the clarity it offers followers.</p><p>This is right. That is wrong. You are going to be supporting the proper group, so to speak. You are going to be supported by that group. We're going to take care of you, make you famous if you do an action that results in our cause being promoted.</p><p>So there is a lot of smaller things here, where people can feel they become part of a family, part of a community, part of a bigger vision that gives them direction in life. And in a lot of these aspects, that's appealing, of course, for people, particularly people who have issues, who may have had problems in their life, who may have some mental weakness of some form, who have not always had that warmth in a regular family or a regular community or have felt cut off and isolated.</p><p>So I think in a number of these areas, as you mentioned, it will be multifocal but we will look at moving that kind of program forward.</p><p>STOUT: Glenn Schoen, terror analyst, joining us from The Hague. Thank you so much for providing your analysis on the type of thinking fueling the hatred in the act of terror in Christchurch on Friday.</p><p>We're talking about the massacre of two mosques that took the lives of 49 people; 29 people in hospital in serious condition, their lives hanging in the balance, including the life of a four-year-old girl suffering from gunshot wounds. This is something that has been criticized and condemned the world over by political leaders, by religious leaders, to say that this is a symptom of hate, a symptom of xenophobia and Islamophobia and is something that cuts deeply into the heart of people here in New Zealand, a country long been known as a friendly destination, a country of tolerance and diversity.</p><p>As the prime minister Jacinda Ardern said, New Zealand, in the wake of this tragedy ,is going through its darkest days. I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Christchurch. We will continue our coverage ahead.

A majority give the President positive reviews for his handling of the nation's economy (51% approve), and his overall approval rating has ticked up to 42% in the new poll. The 51% who say they disapprove of the President's job performance overall represent the lowest share to do so in CNN polling since the start of his presidency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RELATED: Full poll results</p><p>Trump's 42% approval rating at this point in his presidency puts him near the bottom of the list of modern elected presidents, between President Bill Clinton in 1995 (44%) and President Ronald Reagan in 1983 (41%). Both were re-elected to second terms.</p><p>The President's approval ratings for other major issues have largely held steady or turned downward. On handling foreign affairs, 40% approve -- the same share who said so in early February before the President's abruptly-ended summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. About 4 in 10 approve of Trump's handling of taxes (42%), roughly the same as just before the midterm elections last year.</p><p>On the heels of the release of the White House's 2020 budget proposal, which projects large deficits and growing public debt, Trump's ratings for handling the budget are deeply negative: 56% disapprove while just 34% approve.</p><p>The public also breaks sharply negative over the President's handling of immigration. Overall, 58% disapprove and 39% approve, a bit worse than the 41% approve, 54% disapprove divide registered in the early February results.</p><p/><p>That finding follows Congress' passage of a resolution seeking to overturn the President's declaration of a national emergency along the US border with Mexico. Half (50%) of Americans say Congress should have passed that resolution, 42% disagree, and most (55%) were opposed to the President's veto of that resolution. Just 35% say he should have used his veto power in this case.</p><p>The President's strong reviews on the economy come as a plurality say their personal financial situation is better off today than it was three years ago -- before Trump took office. About 4 in 10 (42%) say they are better off now, a similar share (41%) say they're about the same, and 15% say they're worse off than they were three years ago.</p><p>Those results are closely tied to partisanship, with Republicans most apt to report an improved financial situation (65%), and Democrats far less so (19%).</p><p>And as the Democratic Party weighs potential 2020 nominees who espouse stronger government regulation of business, the poll finds little public appetite for deeper regulation overall, or specifically for big tech companies such as Google, Facebook or Amazon.</p><p>About 7 in 10 Americans in the poll say they have more trust in the free market than in the government, up a bit from roughly two-thirds who said so in 2011, as the country was recovering from the Great Recession. That trend holds for all except Republicans -- 77% of whom currently place more faith in the free market than the government, down a tick from 81% who said so in 2011, when Democrat Barack Obama held the White House.</p><p>The share placing more trust in the markets increased among Democrats (from 55% to 61%) and independents (from 65% to 78%).</p><p>Looking specifically to big technology firms, majorities of Americans say they have just a little or no trust in those companies to do the right thing for the economy (57%) or for their users (58%).</p><p>Overall, 42% think government regulation of big tech should go farther, 35% say it's about right as it is and 17% say it goes too far. There is not a massive partisan difference here: 49% of Democrats and 42% of Republicans say it should go further. There's a bigger ideological gap, 52% of liberals say it should go farther and 39% of conservatives say so. But just 11% overall say these companies should be forced to sell off some parts of their businesses, as Elizabeth Warren has proposed.</p><p>That plan doesn't spark widespread interest among Democrats (16% say these businesses should have to sell off some parts of their businesses) or even among liberals (18%). Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, the group which could ultimately decide who wins the Democratic Party's nomination for president, 15% say these companies ought to be forced to sell off some parts of their business.</p><p>The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS March 14 through 17 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, it is larger for subgroups.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20190318cnn-poll-trump-economy-tech1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNV-3T21-JBPX-X0VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><timeReceived>4:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>cnn-poll-trump-economy-tech</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

And CNN is at the forefront.The Aspen Institute is hosting a Cyber Summit[1] in New York City on October 2. One of the topics slated for discussion involves 'Policing Tech.' </p><p>In fact, there will be two whole sessions that promise to focus on 'policing' tech, which will both be moderated by CNN anchors. CNN's Senior While House Correspondent Pamela Brown will moderate a session on 'Disinformation,' while Chief Media Correspondent Brian Stelter will moderate the session titled 'Policing Tech.'The session on 'Disinformation' will ask the question: 'How should we police the challenge of malevolent speech online?' Jigsaw's Director of Research and Development, Yasmin Green, will be attending. Jigsaw is the research branch of Google. Joining Green is Nina Jankowicz, Global Fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, and Richard Stengel, the Under Secretary of State for Public Affairs in the Obama administration.The program reads, 'We face unprecedented threats from misinformation and disinformation -- from both foreign actors and, increasingly, domestic ones.' The liberal media has been targeting conservative outlets more and more.The second session following this panel will be moderated by Stelter. The description for this event reads: 'The last year has seen an intensifying debate about the power of tech companies, questions around consent and the use of consumer data, and the balance between privacy, convenience, free speech, and the role of government regulation. How do we positively shape the rules of the internet for the 21st century?'Stelter is not a big fan of the First Amendment,[2] as he said on the air: 'Perhaps the internet is to the 1st Amendment what the AK-47 is to the 2nd Amendment.' Perhaps he will bring that positive outlook on the First Amendment to this panel.The Aspen Institute[3] is funded by billionaire Pierre Omidyar, who founded the Intercept. It is also massively funded by Big Tech companies such as Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google.

Over the course of CNN's 14-hour television extravaganza, Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates explained their positions with respect to climate change and floated a variety of proposals to cut Americans' energy use and, ostensibly, to stop the climate from changing. A central theme of the night wassacrifice[3]. Many of the candidates' climate change strategies require vast amounts of capital, from Joe Biden's $1.7 trillion to Bernie Sanders' $16.3 trillion. Who is going to end up paying that bill?</p><p> There was very little difference among the candidate positions on CO2-induced climate change, which they all claim is the most dangerous threat the world has ever faced, surpassing the human toll and carnage of any preceding economic or military-related disaster, including theHolocaust and World War II[4]. According to the candidates, our world has only12 years to reverse the coming climate apocalypse[5], so we had all better shape up and climb aboard their policy prescription bandwagons and get moving to avoid it. Because CNN says it's a 'crisis[6],' Democrats were free to offer one insane prediction after the next. CNN was not interested in the fact that the United States is theonly country in the world[7]that has reduced emissions over the past decade-and-a-half while growing its economy,and it certainly wasn't to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field, yet that is what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece, the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de-industrialize the U.S. economy, put millions of people out of work, and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more, all for the sake of 'science' they cannot explain and do not understand. But the candidates weren't fully to blame, as CNN kept making 'scientific' claims that ranged from half-truths to pure nonsense. More than once moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change, or a sign of things to come, when it wasn't. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 'U.S. Hurricane Strikes by Decade' data, reaching back to 1851, can be accessedhere[8]. They show that there has been a 50 percentreductionin the number of major hurricanes making landfall in the United States since the 1930s. For the entire period, there is a slight downward trend in frequency, but the decline since the 1930s is remarkable. So, if anything, hurricanes havebecome less frequent[9], not more, during the period of allegedly man-made global warming. Partial credit, however, must be given to CNN for noting that plans like the 'Green New Deal' will hurt mining and agricultural communities, which fell on deaf ear with some of the candidates. Among the worst ideas[10]: TAXING 'CARBON POLLUTION.' Some called it a 'carbon fee'; others called it a 'carbon tax.' Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX)was the only one offering a 'cap-and-trade' system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue-neutral \u2014 say, by lowering payroll taxes \u2014 though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. BANNING FRACKING.With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden (who agreed last month at the second debate that he would 'eliminate' fracking) and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro (who would back bans at state and local levels), all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years, powered the economic recovery, and made us less dependent on the Mideast. ENDING OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION ON PUBLIC LANDS. The Obama administration tried it, too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy, on fuel prices, and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmental-friendly technology (except as a warrant for more regulation). BANNING NUCLEAR ENERGY.Perhaps with Nevada \u2014 the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests \u2014 in mind, most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero-emissions alternative, with Booker making the obvious argument: if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly, nuclear is the only way. BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS, DISCOURAGING MEAT, ELIMINATING INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted that paper straws are useless, but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway, based on pseudoscience. Booker, a vegan, says you can eat what you want \u2014 thanks! \u2014 but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy-efficient bulbs \u2014 seemingly ignorant of health risks. But there was even more craziness: Biden blamed[11]climate change for the cancer and the genocide in Darfur. Buttigieg said[12]he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested[13]global population control, encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. All wanted to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords, none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification, but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the 'Green New Deal', the 'green' socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Climate change as nothing new Theearth has experienced[14]'Climate Change', Global Warming, and Global Cooling since its birth 4 billion years ago. Most of the myth about climate change are based on reports (recently retracted or drastically revised) of the UN's IPCC, where only a minority of the 2500 'scientists' on the IPCC are in fact are meteorologists. View here:UNIPCC Scientist Debunks UNIPCC Lies - YouTube[15] Restated below is what I've heard from various climate experts over the past few years andThe Heartland Institute's[16]NIPCC report[17](Nongovernmental International Panel of Climate Change).  There is no scientific, verified, meteorological, peer reviewed, evidence thatEXTRAORDINARY'global warming' or 'global cooling' is underway; which is why the left has switched to 'climate change'. There is no scientific, verified, peer reviewed, evidence that man made, (anthropogenic), 'climate change' is underway, nor anticipated. ALL projections to the contrary have proven false! If the U.S. eliminated every bit of its carbon emission producing activities TODAY, to zero emissions, there would be no significant impact on the environment by the year 2100. Major producers of carbon 'pollution' The major producers of carbon 'pollution' areChina and India[18]who are increasing their activities, (coal plant construction), and have no plans to do otherwise. Therefore, anything we do is futile until that changes, dramatically. From a worldwide, strategic, geopolitical viewpoint, 'climate change' efforts supported by the democrats are economically detrimental to the USA, and advantageous to China, Russia and India. Progressives seem to delight in inconveniencing the masses for no reason. Consider the plastic straw ban. EvenNational Geographic[19]\u2014 hardly an anti-environmentalist publication \u2014 admits that plastic straws comprise just 0.025 percent of the plastic in the oceans. China, alone,produces around a third[20]of the ocean's plastic waste.In addition, CO2 emissions aregreater than the U.S. and Europe combined[21], and keep going up. Do Democrats really believe in climate change? Consider the following written by Allum Bokhari on Sept. 6, 2019 and the answer should become apparent,If Democrats cared about the environment they'd talk about China[22]: 'If Democrats really believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, why are they proposing draconian and pointless curbs on the behavior of ordinary Americans? Why aren't they going after multinationals that continue to do business with the world's biggest polluter, without demanding any environmental commitments from them? The real reason Democrats won't go after China is that they are now the party of global elites, and global elites are constantly salivating about the profits that can be made from China's market of 1.4 billion people. They look to Europe and America and see a dwindling middle class with a declining population. There's no money in that, not long-term anyway. Maybe the problem could be fixed with pro-natal policies like Hungary's, but why bother? It's far easier to simply go overseas, to a country that does have a booming population and rising middle class. That's the same reason, by the way, that global elites are so vociferously opposed to President Donald Trump and his agenda. Trade restrictions on China, to protect American jobs? An outrage! The elites can't make money off American jobs, you see. They're just so much more expensive than Chinese jobs! Ask yourself, why is big tech so determined to work with China, despite the political pitfalls? Did Google, which once boasted the hipster motto 'don't be evil,' really think they'd suffer no blow back for developing a censored search engine designed to appease Chinese state censors? Or that working with the Chinese military but not the American one would somehow escape notice? Of course not \u2014 but for all its professed 'values,' there's no way a profit-seeking multinational like Google can resist the temptation of a 1.4 billion-person market. But plastic straw bans, meat bans, and one-child policies won't solve the problem. They simply cause unnecessary pain to ordinary people. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE DIRTY COAL FURNACES KEEP ON BURNING.' It is amusing that adherents to Climate Change, once called Global Warming in the 1990's, and Global Cooling, (A new Ice Age was predicted) in the 1970's, now say they believe in Climate Change. Isn't belief a philosophical or religious function, NOT a scientific function? In that human CO2 is known to cause global warming with high certainty, and confirmed by observations, is buta climate myth[23]. No science is ever 'settled'. Science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as 'settled.'

Over the course of CNN's 14-hour television extravaganza, Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates explained their positions with respect to climate change and floated a variety of proposals to cut Americans' energy use and, ostensibly, to stop the climate from changing. A central theme of the night wassacrifice[3]. Many of the candidates' climate change strategies require vast amounts of capital, from Joe Biden's $1.7 trillion to Bernie Sanders' $16.3 trillion. Who is going to end up paying that bill?</p><p> There was very little difference among the candidate positions on CO2-induced climate change, which they all claim is the most dangerous threat the world has ever faced, surpassing the human toll and carnage of any preceding economic or military-related disaster, including theHolocaust and World War II[4]. According to the candidates, our world has only12 years to reverse the coming climate apocalypse[5], so we had all better shape up and climb aboard their policy prescription bandwagons and get moving to avoid it. Because CNN says it's a 'crisis[6],' Democrats were free to offer one insane prediction after the next. CNN was not interested in the fact that the United States is theonly country in the world[7]that has reduced emissions over the past decade-and-a-half while growing its economy,and it certainly wasn't to expose the ignorance and extremism of the Democratic field, yet that is what happened. Given 40 minutes apiece, the aspiring Democratic contenders showed that they are willing to de-industrialize the U.S. economy, put millions of people out of work, and lower the standard of living for tens of millions more, all for the sake of 'science' they cannot explain and do not understand. But the candidates weren't fully to blame, as CNN kept making 'scientific' claims that ranged from half-truths to pure nonsense. More than once moderators suggested that Hurricane Dorian was caused by climate change, or a sign of things to come, when it wasn't. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 'U.S. Hurricane Strikes by Decade' data, reaching back to 1851, can be accessedhere[8]. They show that there has been a 50 percentreductionin the number of major hurricanes making landfall in the United States since the 1930s. For the entire period, there is a slight downward trend in frequency, but the decline since the 1930s is remarkable. So, if anything, hurricanes havebecome less frequent[9], not more, during the period of allegedly man-made global warming. Partial credit, however, must be given to CNN for noting that plans like the 'Green New Deal' will hurt mining and agricultural communities, which fell on deaf ear with some of the candidates. Among the worst ideas[10]: TAXING 'CARBON POLLUTION.' Some called it a 'carbon fee'; others called it a 'carbon tax.' Former U.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX)was the only one offering a 'cap-and-trade' system as an alternative. All believe that you should be paying more for fuel. None suggested making it revenue-neutral   say, by lowering payroll taxes   though South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg would redistribute the money to the poor. BANNING FRACKING.With the possible exception of former vice president Joe Biden (who agreed last month at the second debate that he would 'eliminate' fracking) and former HUD Secretary Julin Castro (who would back bans at state and local levels), all of the Democrats want to ban the one innovation that has made the greatest difference for our planet in the last twenty years, powered the economic recovery, and made us less dependent on the Mideast. ENDING OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION ON PUBLIC LANDS. The Obama administration tried it, too. Never mind that some public lands have been specifically set aside for oil and gas development. There seems to be little thought about the impact that would have on the U.S. economy, on fuel prices, and on national security. Nor is any credit given for industry advances in environmental-friendly technology (except as a warrant for more regulation). BANNING NUCLEAR ENERGY.Perhaps with Nevada   the fourth state in the 2020 primary contests   in mind, most of the candidates objected to nuclear energy because of challenges around nuclear waste storage. Only businessman Andrew Yang and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) offered defenses of nuclear power as a zero-emissions alternative, with Booker making the obvious argument: if you believe we need to reduce emissions quickly, nuclear is the only way. BANNING PLASTIC STRAWS, DISCOURAGING MEAT, ELIMINATING INCANDESCENT LIGHT BULBS.Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) admitted that paper straws are useless, but wants to ban the plastic ones anyway, based on pseudoscience. Booker, a vegan, says you can eat what you want   thanks!   but the rest want you to find another source of protein. And the candidates mocked Trump for halting the imposition of energy-efficient bulbs   seemingly ignorant of health risks. But there was even more craziness: Biden blamed[11]climate change for the cancer and the genocide in Darfur. Buttigieg said[12]he would explain climate change to folks in the heartland by telling them God thought greenhouse gases were a sin. Bernie Sanders suggested[13]global population control, encouraged by organizations that promote abortion abroad. All wanted to rejoin the Paris Climate Accords, none wants to submit them to the Senate for ratification, but several want to eliminate or evade the filibuster to pass the 'Green New Deal', the 'green' socialist manifesto written by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). Climate change as nothing new Theearth has experienced[14]'Climate Change', Global Warming, and Global Cooling since its birth 4 billion years ago. Most of the myth about climate change are based on reports (recently retracted or drastically revised) of the UN's IPCC, where only a minority of the 2500 'scientists' on the IPCC are in fact are meteorologists. View here:UNIPCC Scientist Debunks UNIPCC Lies - YouTube[15] Restated below is what I've heard from various climate experts over the past few years andThe Heartland Institute's[16]NIPCC report[17](Nongovernmental International Panel of Climate Change).  There is no scientific, verified, meteorological, peer reviewed, evidence thatEXTRAORDINARY'global warming' or 'global cooling' is underway; which is why the left has switched to 'climate change'. There is no scientific, verified, peer reviewed, evidence that man made, (anthropogenic), 'climate change' is underway, nor anticipated. ALL projections to the contrary have proven false! If the U.S. eliminated every bit of its carbon emission producing activities TODAY, to zero emissions, there would be no significant impact on the environment by the year 2100. Major producers of carbon 'pollution' The major producers of carbon 'pollution' areChina and India[18]who are increasing their activities, (coal plant construction), and have no plans to do otherwise. Therefore, anything we do is futile until that changes, dramatically. From a worldwide, strategic, geopolitical viewpoint, 'climate change' efforts supported by the democrats are economically detrimental to the USA, and advantageous to China, Russia and India. Progressives seem to delight in inconveniencing the masses for no reason. Consider the plastic straw ban. EvenNational Geographic[19]  hardly an anti-environmentalist publication   admits that plastic straws comprise just 0.025 percent of the plastic in the oceans. China, alone,produces around a third[20]of the ocean's plastic waste.In addition, CO2 emissions aregreater than the U.S. and Europe combined[21], and keep going up. Do Democrats really believe in climate change? Consider the following written by Allum Bokhari on Sept. 6, 2019 and the answer should become apparent,If Democrats cared about the environment they'd talk about China[22]: 'If Democrats really believe that climate change is an existential threat to humanity, why are they proposing draconian and pointless curbs on the behavior of ordinary Americans? Why aren't they going after multinationals that continue to do business with the world's biggest polluter, without demanding any environmental commitments from them? The real reason Democrats won't go after China is that they are now the party of global elites, and global elites are constantly salivating about the profits that can be made from China's market of 1.4 billion people. They look to Europe and America and see a dwindling middle class with a declining population. There's no money in that, not long-term anyway. Maybe the problem could be fixed with pro-natal policies like Hungary's, but why bother? It's far easier to simply go overseas, to a country that does have a booming population and rising middle class. That's the same reason, by the way, that global elites are so vociferously opposed to President Donald Trump and his agenda. Trade restrictions on China, to protect American jobs? An outrage! The elites can't make money off American jobs, you see. They're just so much more expensive than Chinese jobs! Ask yourself, why is big tech so determined to work with China, despite the political pitfalls? Did Google, which once boasted the hipster motto 'don't be evil,' really think they'd suffer no blow back for developing a censored search engine designed to appease Chinese state censors? Or that working with the Chinese military but not the American one would somehow escape notice? Of course not   but for all its professed 'values,' there's no way a profit-seeking multinational like Google can resist the temptation of a 1.4 billion-person market. But plastic straw bans, meat bans, and one-child policies won't solve the problem. They simply cause unnecessary pain to ordinary people. MEANWHILE, THE CHINESE DIRTY COAL FURNACES KEEP ON BURNING.' It is amusing that adherents to Climate Change, once called Global Warming in the 1990's, and Global Cooling, (A new Ice Age was predicted) in the 1970's, now say they believe in Climate Change. Isn't belief a philosophical or religious function, NOT a scientific function? In that human CO2 is known to cause global warming with high certainty, and confirmed by observations, is buta climate myth[23]. No science is ever 'settled'. Science deals in probabilities, not certainties. When the probability of something approaches 100%, then we can regard the science, colloquially, as 'settled.'

Have a look at the deep state. I appreciate it.  Have a wonderful weekend. \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\" is up next. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening from Chicago. I'm Laura  Ingraham and welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE Special: Trump's Week of  Battles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> President Trump is a fighter. There's no doubt about that, and it's a good  thing because he's facing attacks on multiple fronts. In the next hour,  we're going to tell you how the media are putting stories out, some of them  blatant lies to undermine the president's agenda. Alan Dershowitz will be  here to discuss Trump's latest fight with the Justice Department.  You  won't believe what we're learning about DOJ official Bruce Ohr. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Raymond Arroyo is here with his \"Friday Folly\" segment, where he's going to  tell us of how the funeral of a music legend at times became a political  rally. </p><p> Plus, we've got updates about NFL players kneeling during the anthem and  President Trump's efforts to remake the NAFTA agreement, all coming up. </p><p> But first, our top story, CNN caught red-handed. As we've been telling you  this week, CNN's blockbuster story last month about Michael Cohen was dead  wrong. The network went wild with an anonymously sourced report that claim  Cohen was prepared to tell Mueller's team that President Trump knew in  advance about that infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump,  Jr. and a Russian lawyer. </p><p> We now know that CNN lied about Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis being a  source for the piece. And here's the kicker. Davis now says the story is  false. But still CNN is sticking with its story. And \"Business Insider\" is  reporting that the network isn't planning on revealing its alleged second  source. Huh? </p><p> And the left wonders why Trump's fake news narrative is working. Joining me  now for reaction is \"The Federalist\" Mollie Hemingway who's also a Fox News  contributor, Howie Kurtz, host of Fox News' \"Media Buzz\" which airs at  11:00 a.m. on Sunday, and Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new film \"Death  of a Nation\" is in theaters now and will be in a special showing all  weekend long over Labor Day.</p><p> Dinesh, let's start with you here. This is wild. I mean, CNN is you know,  \"This is CNN,\" the James Earl Jones booming voice. At one time back in the  '80s when CNN started, it was considered kind of a gold standard of this  new2 type of journalism. Where does it stand now after this Lanny Davis  story, the complete bungle by the network? </p><p> DINES D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER;  Well, one can almost think back nostalgically to  the '80s when CNN would have shows like \"Crossfire\" where they would have a  liberal, a conservative, Matt Buchanan on one side, Michael Kinsley on the  other. That's not the CNN of today. Now, it's one thing to spin the news  and interpret it in a manner that is consistent with your own ideological  agenda. </p><p> It's a completely different thing to have a story I which you are reporting  facts. The facts are exposed as false and you dig your heels in and say  that they're true anyway. I mean, this is taking fake news to a new level  and it is setting, you may say, almost a new standard of deception that I  think will haunt CNN for a while. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes. Dinesh, your movie, \"Death of a Nation.\" This is like death  of journalism. Howie Kurtz, I know that cables compete with each other and  it can be pretty rough and tumble and one side -- I get that. But this is  unbelievable. </p><p> They claimed that they tried to, what, contact Lanny Davis initially with  the story and that he declined to comment but it turns out he was initially  the source of the story. I mean, this story gets worse and worse the more  people marinate on it. </p><p> HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST:  Yes, but Lanny Davis has told  me that he never confirmed this allegation for CNN and then he sort of  outed himself as a source. Look, CNN is trying to defend the indefensible. </p><p> It will not discuss on the air, will not discuss publicly what went wrong  with the story about what Michael Cohen knew that Michael Cohen's lawyer  now says it's not true. And this one sentence we standby our story isn't  working because the network is accusing the president of lying about his  knowledge about that Trump Tower meeting. </p><p> I'll tell you one other thing, Laura. If the White House had done something  like this, throw out an incendiary charge and then stand by as the story  begun to crumble, CNN and lots of other news organizations would be  hammering the place for stone walling. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Mollie, and it's not just how they're stone walling tonight,  it's how damaging the particular allegation was that they ran with,  apparently with some source they said was Lanny Davis, which ended up kind  of not being Lanny Davis. So it's the underlying allegation about that  Trump Tower meeting which we know would have been at the crux of the  Mueller investigation. </p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NES CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, they claimed it was a  bombshell when they first reported the story. And as the story is falling  apart, I think part of the reason why they're unable to take responsibility  for flubbing the story is that they hyped it so much. But it's really part  of a pattern of behavior for CNN as it relates to the Russia conclusion  conspiracy theory that they have been pushing for a year and a half. </p><p> And there had been other stories that they claim to have multiple anonymous  sources that also fell through. You remember that they claim that Don, Jr.  had advance knowledge of a WikiLeaks dump while they claim they have  multiple sources, it turned out not to be true and they never explained how  their multiple sources got it wrong. </p><p> They also claimed that James Comey would contradict Donald Trump's  testimony about how James Comey had told him three times he wasn't under  investigation. But we all saw that testimony. He admitted that he had told  President Trump that three times, just as President Trump said. They never  explained how they got that wrong. And these are just three examples of  many stories that they have gotten wrong about the Russia collusion theory. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Now Dinesh, CNN is not the only network under fire for botching  a huge story getting it wrong. But according to now new reports, the top  brass at NBC tried to put the kibosh on Ronan Farrow's bombshell -- real  bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein's sexual predation, basically  forcing Ronan Farrow to take the story to \"The New Yorker\" magazine where  everybody knows by now he ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize.</p><p> And tonight the rumors are also swirling that NBC News chairman, Andy Lack,  is on the hot seat. And this is after President Trump weighed in on NBC's  troubles last night. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Remember the lines from NBC  which is probably worse than CNN. But the word is they're firing the head  of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Dinesh, this is unreal. Harvey Weinstein has a lot of power.</p><p> D'SOUZA:  I think if the CNN story was a lie of commission, the NBC story  is a lie of omission. Now, just think about how powerful their ideology  would have to be because, remember, this is actually not a lie that would  have helped Trump. This actually is a lie to cover up a principle, the  principle of sexual harassment, the principle of sexual abuse, which is  actually a principle on the left. </p><p> And so essentially this principle could only be trumped by a greater  principle on the left. And the greater principle on the left here is we  have to protect our own team. There are very powerful people on the left,  George Soros, Harvey Weinstein, and it is an unwritten rule in a sense of  progressive journalism that these people are untouchable and that you have  to run defense for them and run protection for them. I believe that was  what was going on at NBC. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yeah, he thought he was untouchable and Harvey Weinstein thought  everyone else was touchable, that's the problem here. Howie Kurtz, this is  another wild story. Harvey Weinstein had enormous amount of influence in  Hollywood, enormous amount of political clout with all the fundraisers he  hosted, the money he raised, and deep friendships within the peacock. </p><p> I mean, he and Andy Lack I hear were very good friends. What happened to  the \"we treat all women the same as men. We believe in women's rights\"? And  when this Ronan Farrow, a young journalist was hot on the trail of this  story, general counsel was saying, \"you better back off or we're going to  smear you.\" Again, these are reported allegations by I guess the producers  of Farrow's work. </p><p> KURTZ:  Right. Well, that particular allegation is denied by NBC and I  don't know how much pressure Weinstein brought to (inaudible) but it  remains a huge embarrassment for NBC that after eight months of (inaudible)  let Ronan Farrow walk out the door with that prize-winning story that  essentially launched the MeToo Movement. </p><p> And now you have Farrows investigative reporter -- producer, excuse me --  who just left NBC saying this is a massive breach of journalistic integrity  by NBC, but NBC was never enthusiastic about the story. NBC claims he  didn't have enough and then (inaudible) willing to do on camera, but two  months later, this meticulously reported piece appears in \"The New Yorker\"  and it looked like NBC just didn't have the guts to take on Harvey  Weinstein. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  But what's your gut on this, Howie? Do you think this producer  is blowing smoke here? I mean, it sounds a little odd to me, doesn't it?  Like, oh, we didn't have enough -- they said today he didn't have enough  sources. It wasn't well sourced enoghh. I think he was working on it and  they came down on him and said -- </p><p> KURTZ:  Oh yes. When you're a reporter, you know whether your bosses are  enthusiastic particularly about a sensitive investigative piece. NBC was  not. NBC was willing to let him walk out the door and so nothing can change  the fact that NBC blew this one big time. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And Mollie, before we let you go, this story also bled into  Andrew Cuomo because the report came out that he pulled back on an  investigation into Weinstein I guess after what Weinstein's attorney gave a  $25,000 donation. So, it even bleeds into that part of the political world. </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  It's really clear that we see a lot of stories that get  suppressed or elevated depending on political affiliations or friendships  and that's really inappropriate. We want to believe that our legal  institutions and our media institutions will tell the story regardless of  where it takes them or apply justice regardless and that is a problem that  we're facing in this country right now with different standards for  different people. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right. We have one more topic. We have time for that one  final topic. President Trump last night also shared his thoughts on the  current censorship controversy with big tech.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  Look at social media. It's a thing called free speech rights. You  look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants, and I've  made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship,  blacklisting, and rigged search results. And you know it can go the other  way also. We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, the focus on this from President Trump and conservatives  may be having an effect. With reports like this one from the \"New York  Times\" stating that some Facebook employees are fighting against this  intolerant liberal culture. </p><p> Dinesh, you have written about this in books and spoken about this on  college campuses. The west coast, otherwise effectually (ph) known as the  left coast, especially in big tech, overwhelmingly left wing,  overwhelmingly probably voted for Hillary. And yet they say, oh, this is  just an algorithm. You're all floating conspiracy theories, but now you got  Facebook employees complaining about the mono-culture.</p><p> D'SOUZA:  This I think is very scary. So many conservatives fled to social  media to escape the bias of the mainstream media. And now to discover this  effort to sort of take people and make them into digital non-persons, I  mean, one has to go back to all this (inaudible) George Orwell to find out  this kind of stuff going on now. </p><p> A lot of people say, well, gee, these are private companies. They should be  able to do whatever they want. But this is actually not true. If Google or  Facebook decided for example we're going to shadow ban blacks or we're  going to shadow ban Latinos. These companies would be shut down overnight.</p><p> They know that they can't do that and they wouldn't even dare, but  apparently with conservatives they feel like it's OK to have political  discrimination even though I don't see fundamentally the difference here  between political discrimination and discrimination on any other basis. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Howie, how big of an issue is this? I mean, I can tell when my  radio audience, it blows up the lines. Everyone wants to talk about it.  Everyone seems to have an experience with it. I know it seems anecdotal but  I find Bing by the way -- Bing is the best search engine -- the least  biased in Bing. For whatever reason, that's what I've discovered. Howie? </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Right. Well, it's a huge issue because social media is the new  public square. And Facebook and Twitter both have acknowledged that they  have a problem with instances of bias against conservatives. I think the  evidence against Google is a little less clear. </p><p> So President Trump and others on the right are obviously going to speak out  about this because if you don't, you know, you can disappear if you don't  show up in the search rankings or in0 the trending topics or whatever. But  at the same time, I don't think government regulation is the answer. So  there has to be another way. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes. Mollie, we talked about this earlier. There's a thought  that given the enormity of these corporations, and as Howie said and Dinesh  pointed out, this is a public square today. This is the equivalent of what,  you know, we used to see in the old town square with people with a bull  horn. </p><p> And so could there be a movement to treat them more like public utilities,  so they have some quasi, you know, government oversight of these entities  or would that open up a total can of worms perhaps in the other direction  at some point? </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I personally am not a fan of regulation as an answer to this  situation, but these companies absolutely have sometimes huge market share,  the percentage of which would make standard oil blush. They are cognizant  that they are going to make the government want to weigh in. </p><p> Just because though they're not governmental entities does not mean they  aren't threats to free expression. In the same way that people get mad when  President Trump criticizes the media because they claim that that's a  threat to free expression. It's also a threat when big tech is telling  people what they can and can't say. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right guys. Thank you so much. And wild speculation becomes  a media manufactured frenzy over the Mueller investigation. Details on the  latest desperate play with Alan Dershowitz, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  If you've been watching other news anchors and pundits over the  last day, you may think they sound like a bunch of kids on Christmas Eve.  Now, why am I saying that? </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p> ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST:  You made it to Friday. It is the beginning of the  Labor Day weekend and talk heating up that special counsel Robert Mueller  could drop an August surprise. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Axios looking at speculation over whether Bob Mueller  may actually make some sort of an announcement today. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's hot speculation among the president's lawyers that  today might be a day of action for Robert Mueller.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIPS) </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, today's not quite over yet, but it's a nice serving of  wild unsourced speculation on a Friday. Come on, guys, the news isn't that  boring today. There's a lot happening. But are the president's critics  grasping at any straws over the Mueller probe at this point? </p><p> Joining us now to analyze is Alan Dershowitz, author of the big bestseller  \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump.\" We're also joined by Kendall Coffey, a  former U.S. attorney. Great to see both of you. Professor Dershowitz, that  is quite amusing. </p><p> I've been hearing, it's coming, it's coming, there's something coming. I  don't think Mueller's office is leaking anything. They've been pretty  tight. So, is this just, you know, a case of desperate wishful thinking on  the part of the media? </p><p> ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW:  I think they thought  that we're now two months away from the beginning really of the election.  And Justice Department regulations say you shouldn't have matters that  might interfere with voting or interfere with the election or put a thumb  on the scale of voting within two months. So, this was a time when maybe  something would have happened. </p><p> But look, I think today what's happened is news reporting has become part  of the adversary system. Kendall and I are used to the adversary system.  He's one of the world's great lawyers. He was my lawyer, in fact. And he  and I both understand the adversary system. </p><p> One side presents its view of the facts, the other side presents its view  of the facts, then you have a judge or a jury decides. That's what's  happening with journalism today. And wishful thinking substitutes often for  capital analysis. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  And, Kendall, we're going to play -- we have a couple of  different George Stephanopoulos sound bites. We'll play the second one  where again -- this guy has been around for a while now. He used to work  for the Clinton's obviously, but he's been around for a while, but this is  what constitutes reporting today. Let's watch.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST:  The New York Attorney General has  filed suite against the Trump Foundation which could lead to a criminal  referral. The Manhattan District Attorney also considering charges against  the Trump organization. Trump facing lawsuits in Maryland and D.C. over the  constitution of (inaudible) clause. </p><p> And of course special counsel Robert Mueller investigating possible  collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. The bog question going  forward, will any of these investigations lay the groundwork for  impeachment proceedings in Congress? </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. And we're reporting it  breathlessly like this is all new stuff. Kendall </p><p> KENDALL COFFEY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, I mean, I've never seen a  speculation become so intoxicating to the media. I have to say by the way  as in aside. Alan Dershowitz is the greatest legal talent in America and a  personal hero of mine. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Oh, you guys are too much. You guys are too much.</p><p> COFFEY:  Alan is -- Alan speaks for himself. He is magnificent. But let me  talk about the election because they're not supposed to drop bombshells on  the midterm. Who knows if there's any bombshells to drop? And let's also  recognize that the election is coming up very fast. If there's a two-month  standard years ago, early voting in Florida, pretty important state, starts  around October 27th. </p><p> Overseas absentees go out next month and by October, beginning of October,  domestic absentees go out. So, I don't think there is any bombshell that  they are rolling out anytime soon, but from the standpoint of avoiding  interference with an election, I think the deadline has passed. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right. Professor Dershowitz, the guy who's already in the  middle of the Lanny Davis-Trump Tower story anonymous source controversy,  Jim Sciutto, who a name I always mispronounce. He also weighed in on the  speculation. Let's watch. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOIST:  You used the term constitutional crisis and that  phrase has been uttered a number of times and warned about on a number of  things. In this environment, though, would it really be received that way,  right? Because arguably the president has shirked constitutional  responsibility, certainly broken norms a number of times, frankly without  consequence. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Broken norms. Now we're at broken norms, Alan. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I just don't agree with that. Well, you know, the system  of checks and balances is working very, very effectively. The courts are  striking down some executive orders, upholding some. The media is critical  of the president, some supporting the president. The academy is generally  putting pressure against the president. Churches, business, everybody is  involved in checking and balancing everybody else. </p><p> Democracy is working. This is not a constitutional crisis. If the president  is subpoenaed, he'll go to court. And if he goes to court he may win, he  may lose. And if he loses he will comply with the orders of the court. This  is the way Madison had in mind when he created our awkward system of checks  and balances, which was not designed to promote efficiency, but to avoid  tyranny. It's working. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Kendall, I'd say I'm not sure Madison had a special counsel in  mind. I might beg to differ with the professor there. I don't know about  that. To me it seems like this has gone way beyond a check and a balance.  Check and balance was impeachment and conviction of a sentence. I'm not  sure a special counsel is what any of our framers intended. </p><p> But I want to run another topic because I have you two gentlemen here. I  would like to get your thought on another Mueller-related tip. Two sources  told Fox News' Catherine Herridge, that DOJ's Bruce Ohr kept a Mueller  deputy in the loop about anti-Trump Steele dossier. So, in other word, does  that endanger Mueller's ethical standing? I'll go to kendall on that. </p><p> COFFEY:  Well, it's troubling, isn't it? I mean, if you think about -- and  whether it splashes over to Bob Mueller is a different question. But it's  obvious that Bruce Ohr's wife was working for a private company funded by  Democrats. Some of my best friends are Democrats (inaudible), but  nevertheless, that is a glaring conflict of interest. </p><p> And what interactions he had with others, which were frankly outside of his  immediate duties as the director of OCDETF, which focuses on drug  trafficking organizations, its also in (inaudible). So it raises a lot of  questions. DOJ in my mind has not done a satisfactory job of explaining it.  They're really effective at investigating others, but when they go under  the microscope, sometimes we don't get a lot of clarity. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, Alan, at the end of the week here, any more thoughts  on Bruce Ohr as a close door testimony this week when his name has been  occupying a lot of air time, for obvious reasons with his connection with  Christopher Steele. His wife of course works at Fusion GPS. You know the  drill. </p><p> DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I was prepared to give Bruce Ohr the presumption of  innocence. He was a student at Harvard Law School. Everybody tells me he's  a really good guy. And the thing that really put me away from Ohr, maybe  overcame the pure presumption of innocence, is the presence of his wife at  a lunch or breakfast or whatever it was, meeting where obviously he was  trying to obtain information in an official capacity and his wife was  working for a private company. </p><p> I do think that the inspector general now has to really look into that  relationship. And I trust the inspector general. I think he's one of the  very few people who come away from all of this looking very good. And I  would leave it to the inspector general to give us a thorough investigation  or good answer as to the relationship between Bruce Ohr, his wife, the  company, the Democrats, the Justice Department. It's very complicated. </p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. And a musical legend's  funeral turning political? And Ryan Gosling setting up a huge controversy  around the American flag and his new Neil Armstrong biopic. All that in  \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS HOST:  We're live from America's News  Headquarters, I'm Marianne Rafferty. John McCain receiving the highest  honor from Congress today, lying in state in the capitol rotunda. The  Arizona senator is just the 30th person in the nation's history to receive  this honor joining a distinguished list that includes President Abraham  Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan. Members of Congress gave  tribute during today's ceremony after which members of the public were also  allowed to pay their respects.</p><p> President Trump pushing for a new deal with Canada, but negotiations with  Canada are off to a rocky start. The Toronto star today saying it was given  off the record remarks from President Trump where he said he refused to  compromise with Canada. President Trump called the leak a serious  violation, but added that at least Canada knows where it stands.</p><p> I'm Marianne Rafferty.  Now back to the INGRAHAM ANGLE.</p><p> INGRAHAM:   It's Friday, and you know what that means.  </p><p> Ryan Gosling's new Neil Armstrong biopic has set off a huge controversy and  a boycott is under way.  For more on that and the political edge of Aretha  Franklin's funeral, we're joined by \"New York Times\" bestselling author of  the \"Will Wilder\" series, and FOX News contributor, Raymond Arroyo.  Now,  Ryan Gosling, Raymond, he's such an affable, nice guy.  It sounds like such  an interesting biopic, astronaut.  Why could this be possibly in any way  cantankerous or controversial?  </p><p> RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Laura, they decided not to show Neil  Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon, which is of course a fact  of his life.  Now, their reasoning for doing this, Gosling says in an  interview around the Venice film festival, is this, and we'll put it up on  the screen.  He says, \"I think this was widely regarded in the end as a  human achievement, and that's how we chose to view it.  So I don't think  that Neil viewed himself as an American hero.  From my interviews with his  family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite.  And we wanted  the film to reflect Neil.\"  </p><p> Now, I don't understand how planting a flag on the moon in any way  contradicts his being a humble hero or being reluctant to embrace that  moniker as the hero.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  It's another way of trashing patriotism.  It's another way of  moving beyond the nationalism or nationalistic spirit, fervor of the  moment.  And Chuck Yeager tweeted out, Raymond, who obviously knew Neil  Armstrong well, he basically threw some water on what Gosling said, that he  wouldn't like that flag, he mentioned, he didn't consider it an American  achievement.  It's ridiculous.  </p><p> ARROYO:  My feeling is, if you're doing a biopic, stick to the facts.  He  planted an American flag.  Plant an American flag.  Now there's a boycott  movement, a #boycottfirstmanmovement.  And this thing is sparking all sorts  of outrage, and it's not even out yet.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes.  What's that on his space outfit there?  I think that's an  American flag.  Yes, Chuck Yeager said, not the Chuck I knew, basically,  he's 95 years old, and he still had it in him.  Yes, look at that flag on  his astronaut uniform there.  Come on.  </p><p> All right, Raymond, what else is happening?  We had kind of dueling  funerals today.  It was something on television.  You had the John McCain  funeral and then you had the -- or memorial service.  He was lying in state  at the capital.  Then you Aretha Franklin funeral in Detroit.  </p><p> ARROYO:  Two great Americans, a musical legend, a statesman, both being  honored.  But both these events in some ways, particularly Aretha  Franklin's funeral, turned very political.  Here is Al Sharpton at the  queen of soul's funeral in Detroit.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REV. AL SHARPTON:  On Sunday on my show I misspelled \"respect,\" and a a lot  of you all corrected me.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> SHARPTON:  Now I want you all to help me correct President Trump to teach  him what it means.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> SHARPTON:  When word had went out that Ms. Franklin had passed, Trump said  she used to work for me.  No, she used to perform for you.  She worked for  us.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ARROYO:  I don't know why they have to politicize everything, but we see  this across American life.  People just want to turn sports, now even the  great celebration of a life, a musical legend, the queen of soul, it's  being twisted and turned into a political rally.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Raymond, no, no, this was so gratuitous.  And, again, Aretha  Franklin, one of the great American voices of all time.  Didn't she get an  award from George W. Bush?  I guess she was a Democrat, but she didn't seem  like an overtly political person.  Maybe I missed that.  Maybe I wasn't  aware of that.  But it just seemed completely out of step.  And then you  had Farrakhan up on stage.  You had Jesse Jackson, but Farrakhan was an  interesting person to have there on the same stage as Bill Clinton and  other luminaries.  </p><p> ARROYO:  Ariana Grande took the stage, Chaka Khan.  This was \"The Voice\"  meets \"Showtime at the Apollo.\" It was unbelievable.  Everybody trying to  top one another.  And as you said, it was a rather interesting backdrop to  Ariana Grande.  And it looks like Farrakhan and Bill Clinton got quite an  eyeful.</p><p> But here's my larger problem with this.  Rather than focus on the  individual whose life is being celebrated, it turns into everybody elbowing  each other to get their moment on the stage.  Even Maxine Waters managed to  barge into this celebration.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Councilwoman -- I'm sorry, congresswoman who has been  attacked like never before because she's a strong black woman.   Congresswoman Maxine Waters from southside L.A., South Central.</p><p> (APPLAUSE)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody just point over there.  Tell her, we've got  your back.  Come on, say it so everybody will hear you out there.  We've  got your back.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ARROYO:  But Maxine during the Wakanda salute there from \"Black Panther.\"   So everybody got their moment in the spotlight.  You know, Laura, my  problem with this is both of these funerals had become television events.   Multi-venues, star-studded lineups, they really are made for TV events.   And my concern is we're going to see people ahead of time booking the  rights to their own funeral so that the networks can get -- Netflix  announces Cher's funeral.  They've got the exclusive right.  I don't see  how this serves the end of celebrating a life and bringing people together.   We're using great lives to divide Americans, and that's not --  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Some mean person on Facebook said something like, Aretha  Franklin's memorial service was so great that it's been picked up for ten  episodes on Netflix.  I almost fell over.  But, OK, I guess it was on for  four or five hours.  But, my goodness, it was star-studded and it did get  political.  </p><p> ARROYO:  Six hours.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Six hours, that's all.  OK.  And Raymond, thanks so much.</p><p> And as the NFL season prepares to kick off, there's new data on just how  many Americans side with President Trump over the National Anthem protest.   Why it should send chills through the league, next.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know you well.  You love  our country.  You're proud of our history.  And you always respect our  great American flag.  </p><p> We are standing up for the heroes who protect America.  We are proudly  standing up for our National Anthem.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, that was President Trump in  Evansville, Indiana, last night.  And when the NFL season is ready to kick  off, the National Anthem protests are yet again taking center field, pun  intended.  The league has plenty of reason to be concerned.  A new \"Wall  Street Journal\"/NBC News poll finds that 54 percent of voters think that  kneeling during the anthem is not appropriate.  And that's compared to 43  percent who say it's a fair way to protest racial inequality.  </p><p> Joining me now with their reactions, Kevin Jackson is an author and a FOX  News contributor, and Antjuan Seawright is a Democratic strategist.   Gentlemen, it's great to see you tonight.  Antjuan, let's start with you.   The numbers aren't hugely disparate there, a majority saying the National  Anthem, kneeling is not appropriate.  But there's a sizable number of  people saying it's fine, it doesn't really bother them.  It's not clear  that this is probably good, ultimately, for NFL viewership, though,  Antjuan.  I'm ready to go to the Notre Dame game tomorrow night.  And  college football is where it's at.  I'm sorry.  NFL football, I just know a  lot of people who are just not all that jazzed on it.  And I think this is  part of the reason.  Even if it's not intended to be disrespectful to the  military, a lot of military veterans do feel that way.  And I think that  ends up hurting the whole experience for just a lot of folks.  </p><p> ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, Laura, a couple things.  I  think sometimes what gets lost in the conversation is why this even  started.  This started because Kaepernick felt like black and brown people  were mistreated at the hands of law enforcement.  That's number one.  </p><p> Number two, when you look at polls, and I'll take this scenario or any  other scenario where people are being surveyed, it's all about how the  question is asked, who is doing the asking, and how the question is being  framed.  But if you look at the NFL and you look at the bottom line, their  revenue numbers, their revenue increased by five percent last year, not to  mention the $50 million Amazon deal for streaming that was signed.  </p><p> And so while these people may say they may not agree with the protests, I  tend to believe that they still will watch the NFL.  And football, like any  other sport, is one of the very few things that most people, Democrats,  Republicans, black or white, rich or poor, agree on.  I just hate it's  turned into a political football, no pun intended.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, Kevin, I don't think anyone is trying to make it  political.  I think people -- </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Well, the president is, Laura.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Well, I think the president is standing up for what he believes  in, which is just like the folks who are kneeling.  They're kneeling for  what they believe in, and the president is standing up for what he believes  in.  You can't have it one way and say this whole side gets to do this when  the president can't talk about what he believes.  Kevin, your thoughts on  this?  </p><p> KEVIN JACKSON:  As Jerry Glanville said one time, NFL is going to stand for  \"Not For Long.\"  He can quote all the numbers and statics he wants.  The  NFL is in triage.  And I don't know why they're on this self-defeating  path, but they like being on it.  And it reminds me of what the Democrats  are doing in going against Donald Trump in many ways.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Here we go.  </p><p> JACKSON:  At the end of the day -- yes, here we go.  You're exactly right.   Here we go.  When you look at what's going on with what Donald Trump is  standing up, the flag, he's standing up for veterans.  By the way, he's  also standing up for police.  I've got a film coming out called \"Bleeding  Blue,\" and one of police in there says, hey, when something happens in your  neighborhood, are you going to call a cop or are you going to call Colin  Kaepernick?  And he's exactly right.  The police are going to have to do  their jobs, and Colin Kaepernick, whether he likes it or not, he started a  trend.  And, Laura, I don't know what the statistics are, but I'll tell  you, the overwhelming number of Americans believe in the flag, believe in  the Anthem, believe in standing for it, and believe in the military, and  believe in the police.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  You can take a knee in protest but also stand up for believing  in America and everything she stands for.  </p><p> JACKSON:  Take a knee for the people killed in Chicago. </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Again, I'll say, you can focus on why this even started, the  fact that African-American, black and brown people are five times more  likely to be mishandled or killed at the hands of law enforcement.  This is  why that started.  And so while you can see these people are not pro- America, look, my father served in the military.  My father served so that  these players would have the right to take their knee.  </p><p> JACKSON:  More black people are killed by other black people than cops.   And you can argue this as much as you want.  Randy Moss wore a tie to get  inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame and it had 12 black people's names on it  that expanded over a decade.  This idea that cops are out hunting and  killing black people is ridiculous.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  No one ever said they were out hunting and killing black  people.  I said they were mishandled at the hands of law enforcement.   Statistics will prove that to be true.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  We've got to move on.  We've got other topics we want to hit  while I have you both here.  So I want to get your reaction to this.  Last  night CNN's Don Lemon took a pretty nasty shot at Kanye West over Kanye's  support for President Trump.  Watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  It's like a word salad where you realize that Kanye  West, entitled to his own opinion, but is not very bright and not very --  when it comes -- I'm talking about this position, not overall, but when it  comes to these issues, he's not clued in.  He needs to read about it before  he speaks about it.  I'm not saying he's not a bright person.  I take that  back.  That's not what I meant.  But when it comes to this particular  issue, he needs to look at a book, read some history, and understand what  he's talking about.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  That's pretty condescending coming from Don Lemon, who himself  has had a few wobbly moments.  Let's watch.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love you, too, but we really don't need to see  what's about to happen here.  I love you, Don.  No, keep it closed.  OK,  I'm cutting you off after this one.  Should I cut him off?  </p><p> DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  A lot of people have been asking about that, about  black holes and on and on and on, and all of these conspiracy theories.   Let's look at this.  Noah says, \"What else can you think about?  Black  hole?  Bermuda Triangle.\"  And then Deji says \"Just like the movie \"Lost?\"  And of course it's also referencing \"The Twilight Zone,\" which has a very  similar plot.  That's what people are saying.  I know it's preposterous.   But is it preposterous?  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  He was talking in that last sound bite about the Malaysian jet  that disappeared, crashed, but could have been pulled up by a black hole.   I mean, I guess.  I'm being charitable tonight.  I guess.  </p><p> JACKSON:  You don't have to have Don Lemon being drunk to showcase his  lunacy.  Just watch his program any night.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Because you don't agree with him.  </p><p> JACKSON:  No.  I don't agree with you, but you're sitting here and I'm not  interrupting you.  Look, at the end of the day, when you look at what he  said about Kanye West, he's trying to correct a grown man who dare have an  opinion that differs from his.  And, oh, by the way, Donald Lemon, Kanye  happens to be right.  There are many reasons for us to be looking at Donald  Trump through the prism, it certainly is black folks, to be looking to  Donald Trump as a person who's done a lot more for blacks than Barack  Obama.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Oh, Jesus Christ, man. </p><p> JACKSON:  And people don't want to admit this.  And for Don Lemon and this  particular gentleman to keep talking about Donald Trump as if he's some bad  guy, or Kanye West who is bringing out what we're calling the Kanye effect  is ridiculous.  More black people are waking up because of Kanye West and  his comments, because they're tired of being demonized, because --</p><p> INGRAHAM:  All right, let's go to Antjuan.  Antjuan?</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Laura, that sounds all good.  What Don Lemon did -- he  corrected his statement.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Antjuan, Antjuan.</p><p> JACKSON:  I know, but I'm going to interrupt him like he did me, Laura.  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  What Don Lemon corrected was Kaney's position, and Kanye even  apologized and walked it back, his comment about enslavement a couple of  days ago on a national radio show because he was actually wrong.  And I  appreciate him taking his comments back.</p><p> JACKSON:  He wasn't wrong.</p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Look, I am not for criticizing someone for having an opinion  because we all have one.  </p><p> JACKSON:  Yes, you are.</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, why not?  </p><p> SEAWRIGHT:  Make sure when you speak of a certain instance, make sure that  the facts are very, very clear.  And I'm glad that Kanye West was able to  be man enough to walk back his comments.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Guys, we've got to roll.  All right, we've got to roll, guys.   Thanks so much for joining us tonight.  </p><p> I have a question, though.  Is President Trump about to prove his naysayers  wrong and score a huge victory for America?  Well, how about in trade?   Back in a moment.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Canada feeling the heat from President Trump over a new trade  deal.  Tensions spilled out in the public view throughout the day under a  looming deadline.  Take a listen to Canada's minister of foreign affairs.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  We are committed  to speaking for Canada to a deal which is a good deal for Canada, not just  any deal.  We are very good as Canadians at finding win-win compromises.   At the end of the day, though, we are only going to sign a deal that's good  for Canada.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  Now, a final agreement was not yet inked, reached today.  But  talks are set to resume next Wednesday.  And my sources are telling me  they're very close.  </p><p> Joining us now to analyze is Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy, along with  Democratic strategist Roger Risk.  Great to see you both.  Roger, let's  start with you.  This issue of trade is something I've been writing about  for, I don't know, about 20 years.  And Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, Luis  Videgaray who was on our show exclusively on Monday night, and Freeland  were all behind closed doors today.  They're hammering this out.  It's very  complicated.  The agricultural subsidies that Canada gives, especially to  its dairy farmers, are incredibly important to Quebec.  And that's a  sticking point.  But my sources are telling me they're extremely close.   And no one wants Canada to walk away from the table.  Canada doesn't and  obviously the administration doesn't.  Your reaction tonight?  </p><p> ROGER FISK, FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's almost the  tale of two trade talks.  I find some encouraging elements to how the  administration has conducted itself with the Mexican set of the trade  talks.  That's been more sober, more process-driven.  They've been working  on it for a year.  I hope that the success of that as we move forward  starts to guide how the president views the resources around him, starts to  maybe trust in some of the professionals that are there to help him.  </p><p> The Canadian discussion is obviously much more accelerated and I think is  going to take more time maybe than what we think right now.  And then  there's other factors that are going to make this more difficult as we go  ahead.  We have the 90-day window with Congress.  If you look at the letter  that the Senate majority leader sent to the president with 35 of his  colleagues, I think there's every indication that Congress wants to get  into the details of this.  And then you're going to have a change of  administrations in Mexico.  </p><p> Overall, I think we are actually closer to the starting line than we are to  the finish line.  I wouldn't want the administration to start spiking the  football.  There's more work to do, but this is actually encouraging.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Yes, I mean, Sean, Congressman Duffy, this is something that the  left, never Trump, they were all against it.  Chamber of Commerce never  wanted this.  They said it was never going to happen.  It is going to  happen.  I will count my chickens.  It is going to happen and it's probably  going to happen next week.  And no one thought Trump could do it.  No one  thought Trump could do it.  Your reaction tonight.  </p><p> REP. SEAN DUFFY, (R) WISCONSIN:  They had no faith in a great negotiator,  Donald Trump.  Let's be clear what's happening, Laura.  When Donald Trump  engaged Mexico, they recognized that there was some unfair practices  between the two countries.  They sat down and they worked them out with us,  and it's a winner for both of us, but it's a winner for the American  worker.  From all my contacts inside the administration, the Canadians,  they've been really hard to deal with.  They're using America as a piggy  bank, as Donald Trump will say, and they want to keep that piggy bank alive  and well, sucking cash and jobs out of our country.  </p><p> And Donald Trump, thank God he's standing up for the Wisconsin dairy.  We  want to sell our products all over the world.  We can't sell them into  Canada.  They put a 200 to 300 percent tariff on our products.  Laura, what  happens if we said, OK, you put a 300 percent tariff on our milk.  We'll  put a 300 percent tariff on your autos that you're producing and trying to  sell here.  See how that goes over in Canada.  Unfair.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Roger, what happened in this NAFTA set of talks is Canada was  involved for almost the entire last year except for the last two months,  because then they thought, oh, they're never going to agree, Mexico and the  United States.  Then we'll stand with Mexico against the United States and  we'll get more out of it.  Lo and behold, Mexico struck a deal with the  United States and Canada was odd man out.  </p><p> So Freeland flies in at the last minute and says, OK, maybe we can work  something out.  But that was a brilliant move.  I think they underestimated  the strength of the relationship forged by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner,  the entire U.S. TR team.  These guys have been working around the clock,  literally around the clock over the last 10 days.  And I don't think people  fully understood the strength of this new relationship with Mexico,  presidential tweets notwithstanding.  </p><p> FISK:  Well, I think it's a great indication that the president should be  able to rely on some of the experts he has.  And I hope he starts to do  that in some of the other challenges that he has on his plate.  The issues  with Mexico, some of the progress that was made with the auto parts and  where the assembly points are located and things like that I think are  great.  I think you have to agree, there's still more work to be done.   This is not the end of the whole process.</p><p> DUFFY:  The left wants us to look to the globalists that were there before  for their expertise.  Donald Trump has a great gut himself, but we want  those who are going to negotiation for America, for American dairy, for  American manufacturers.  </p><p> INGRAHAM:  Guys, thank you so much.  We're out of time, but fantastic  conversation.  We're going to be right back.    </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> INGRAHAM:  That's all the time we have tonight.  I want to give a big  thanks to a team out here in our Chicago bureau who helped get together the  show over the last few days.  It was a Herculean effort.  And don't forget  to tweet me @IngrahamAngle.  Have a wonderful Labor Day weekend, and be  sure to watch a special addition of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE on Labor Day.  It's  the best of \"Seen and Unseen\" with my partner in crime, Raymond Arroyo.  </p><p> And until then, have a wonderful weekend, fly your flag, hang out with your  family and friends.  Up next, Shannon Bream.  Goodnight form Chicago.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Have a look at the deep state. I appreciate it. Have a wonderful weekend. \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\" is up next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Good evening from Chicago. I'm Laura Ingraham and welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE Special: Trump's Week of Battles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is a fighter. There's no doubt about that, and it's a good thing because he's facing attacks on multiple fronts. In the next hour, we're going to tell you how the media are putting stories out, some of them blatant lies to undermine the president's agenda. Alan Dershowitz will be here to discuss Trump's latest fight with the Justice Department. You won't believe what we're learning about DOJ official Bruce Ohr.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Raymond Arroyo is here with his \"Friday Folly\" segment, where he's going to tell us of how the funeral of a music legend at times became a political rally.</p><p>Plus, we've got updates about NFL players kneeling during the anthem and President Trump's efforts to remake the NAFTA agreement, all coming up.</p><p>But first, our top story, CNN caught red-handed. As we've been telling you this week, CNN's blockbuster story last month about Michael Cohen was dead wrong. The network went wild with an anonymously sourced report that claim Cohen was prepared to tell Mueller's team that President Trump knew in advance about that infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump, Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</p><p>We now know that CNN lied about Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis being a source for the piece. And here's the kicker. Davis now says the story is false. But still CNN is sticking with its story. And \"Business Insider\" is reporting that the network isn't planning on revealing its alleged second source. Huh?</p><p>And the left wonders why Trump's fake news narrative is working. Joining me now for reaction is \"The Federalist\" Mollie Hemingway who's also a Fox News contributor, Howie Kurtz, host of Fox News' \"Media Buzz\" which airs at 11:00 a.m. on Sunday, and Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new film \"Death of a Nation\" is in theaters now and will be in a special showing all weekend long over Labor Day.</p><p>Dinesh, let's start with you here. This is wild. I mean, CNN is you know, \"This is CNN,\" the James Earl Jones booming voice. At one time back in the `80s when CNN started, it was considered kind of a gold standard of this new2 type of journalism. Where does it stand now after this Lanny Davis story, the complete bungle by the network?</p><p>DINES D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER; Well, one can almost think back nostalgically to the `80s when CNN would have shows like \"Crossfire\" where they would have a liberal, a conservative, Matt Buchanan on one side, Michael Kinsley on the other. That's not the CNN of today. Now, it's one thing to spin the news and interpret it in a manner that is consistent with your own ideological agenda.</p><p>It's a completely different thing to have a story I which you are reporting facts. The facts are exposed as false and you dig your heels in and say that they're true anyway. I mean, this is taking fake news to a new level and it is setting, you may say, almost a new standard of deception that I think will haunt CNN for a while.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Dinesh, your movie, \"Death of a Nation.\" This is like death of journalism. Howie Kurtz, I know that cables compete with each other and it can be pretty rough and tumble and one side -- I get that. But this is unbelievable.</p><p>They claimed that they tried to, what, contact Lanny Davis initially with the story and that he declined to comment but it turns out he was initially the source of the story. I mean, this story gets worse and worse the more people marinate on it.</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST: Yes, but Lanny Davis has told me that he never confirmed this allegation for CNN and then he sort of outed himself as a source. Look, CNN is trying to defend the indefensible.</p><p>It will not discuss on the air, will not discuss publicly what went wrong with the story about what Michael Cohen knew that Michael Cohen's lawyer now says it's not true. And this one sentence we standby our story isn't working because the network is accusing the president of lying about his knowledge about that Trump Tower meeting.</p><p>I'll tell you one other thing, Laura. If the White House had done something like this, throw out an incendiary charge and then stand by as the story begun to crumble, CNN and lots of other news organizations would be hammering the place for stone walling.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Mollie, and it's not just how they're stone walling tonight, it's how damaging the particular allegation was that they ran with, apparently with some source they said was Lanny Davis, which ended up kind of not being Lanny Davis. So it's the underlying allegation about that Trump Tower meeting which we know would have been at the crux of the Mueller investigation.</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NES CONTRIBUTOR: Well, they claimed it was a bombshell when they first reported the story. And as the story is falling apart, I think part of the reason why they're unable to take responsibility for flubbing the story is that they hyped it so much. But it's really part of a pattern of behavior for CNN as it relates to the Russia conclusion conspiracy theory that they have been pushing for a year and a half.</p><p>And there had been other stories that they claim to have multiple anonymous sources that also fell through. You remember that they claim that Don, Jr. had advance knowledge of a WikiLeaks dump while they claim they have multiple sources, it turned out not to be true and they never explained how their multiple sources got it wrong.</p><p>They also claimed that James Comey would contradict Donald Trump's testimony about how James Comey had told him three times he wasn't under investigation. But we all saw that testimony. He admitted that he had told President Trump that three times, just as President Trump said. They never explained how they got that wrong. And these are just three examples of many stories that they have gotten wrong about the Russia collusion theory.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now Dinesh, CNN is not the only network under fire for botching a huge story getting it wrong. But according to now new reports, the top brass at NBC tried to put the kibosh on Ronan Farrow's bombshell -- real bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein's sexual predation, basically forcing Ronan Farrow to take the story to \"The New Yorker\" magazine where everybody knows by now he ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>And tonight the rumors are also swirling that NBC News chairman, Andy Lack, is on the hot seat. And this is after President Trump weighed in on NBC's troubles last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Remember the lines from NBC which is probably worse than CNN. But the word is they're firing the head of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Dinesh, this is unreal. Harvey Weinstein has a lot of power.</p><p>D'SOUZA: I think if the CNN story was a lie of commission, the NBC story is a lie of omission. Now, just think about how powerful their ideology would have to be because, remember, this is actually not a lie that would have helped Trump. This actually is a lie to cover up a principle, the principle of sexual harassment, the principle of sexual abuse, which is actually a principle on the left.</p><p>And so essentially this principle could only be trumped by a greater principle on the left. And the greater principle on the left here is we have to protect our own team. There are very powerful people on the left, George Soros, Harvey Weinstein, and it is an unwritten rule in a sense of progressive journalism that these people are untouchable and that you have to run defense for them and run protection for them. I believe that was what was going on at NBC.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yeah, he thought he was untouchable and Harvey Weinstein thought everyone else was touchable, that's the problem here. Howie Kurtz, this is another wild story. Harvey Weinstein had enormous amount of influence in Hollywood, enormous amount of political clout with all the fundraisers he hosted, the money he raised, and deep friendships within the peacock.</p><p>I mean, he and Andy Lack I hear were very good friends. What happened to the \"we treat all women the same as men. We believe in women's rights\"? And when this Ronan Farrow, a young journalist was hot on the trail of this story, general counsel was saying, \"you better back off or we're going to smear you.\" Again, these are reported allegations by I guess the producers of Farrow's work.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Well, that particular allegation is denied by NBC and I don't know how much pressure Weinstein brought to (inaudible) but it remains a huge embarrassment for NBC that after eight months of (inaudible) let Ronan Farrow walk out the door with that prize-winning story that essentially launched the MeToo Movement.</p><p>And now you have Farrows investigative reporter -- producer, excuse me -- who just left NBC saying this is a massive breach of journalistic integrity by NBC, but NBC was never enthusiastic about the story. NBC claims he didn't have enough and then (inaudible) willing to do on camera, but two months later, this meticulously reported piece appears in \"The New Yorker\" and it looked like NBC just didn't have the guts to take on Harvey Weinstein.</p><p>INGRAHAM: But what's your gut on this, Howie? Do you think this producer is blowing smoke here? I mean, it sounds a little odd to me, doesn't it? Like, oh, we didn't have enough -- they said today he didn't have enough sources. It wasn't well sourced enoghh. I think he was working on it and they came down on him and said --</p><p>KURTZ: Oh yes. When you're a reporter, you know whether your bosses are enthusiastic particularly about a sensitive investigative piece. NBC was not. NBC was willing to let him walk out the door and so nothing can change the fact that NBC blew this one big time.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And Mollie, before we let you go, this story also bled into Andrew Cuomo because the report came out that he pulled back on an investigation into Weinstein I guess after what Weinstein's attorney gave a $25,000 donation. So, it even bleeds into that part of the political world.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: It's really clear that we see a lot of stories that get suppressed or elevated depending on political affiliations or friendships and that's really inappropriate. We want to believe that our legal institutions and our media institutions will tell the story regardless of where it takes them or apply justice regardless and that is a problem that we're facing in this country right now with different standards for different people.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. We have one more topic. We have time for that one final topic. President Trump last night also shared his thoughts on the current censorship controversy with big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Look at social media. It's a thing called free speech rights. You look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants, and I've made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting, and rigged search results. And you know it can go the other way also. We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, the focus on this from President Trump and conservatives may be having an effect. With reports like this one from the \"New York Times\" stating that some Facebook employees are fighting against this intolerant liberal culture.</p><p>Dinesh, you have written about this in books and spoken about this on college campuses. The west coast, otherwise effectually (ph) known as the left coast, especially in big tech, overwhelmingly left wing, overwhelmingly probably voted for Hillary. And yet they say, oh, this is just an algorithm. You're all floating conspiracy theories, but now you got Facebook employees complaining about the mono-culture.</p><p>D'SOUZA: This I think is very scary. So many conservatives fled to social media to escape the bias of the mainstream media. And now to discover this effort to sort of take people and make them into digital non-persons, I mean, one has to go back to all this (inaudible) George Orwell to find out this kind of stuff going on now.</p><p>A lot of people say, well, gee, these are private companies. They should be able to do whatever they want. But this is actually not true. If Google or Facebook decided for example we're going to shadow ban blacks or we're going to shadow ban Latinos. These companies would be shut down overnight.</p><p>They know that they can't do that and they wouldn't even dare, but apparently with conservatives they feel like it's OK to have political discrimination even though I don't see fundamentally the difference here between political discrimination and discrimination on any other basis.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Howie, how big of an issue is this? I mean, I can tell when my radio audience, it blows up the lines. Everyone wants to talk about it. Everyone seems to have an experience with it. I know it seems anecdotal but I find Bing by the way -- Bing is the best search engine -- the least biased in Bing. For whatever reason, that's what I've discovered. Howie?</p><p>INGRAHAM: Right. Well, it's a huge issue because social media is the new public square. And Facebook and Twitter both have acknowledged that they have a problem with instances of bias against conservatives. I think the evidence against Google is a little less clear.</p><p>So President Trump and others on the right are obviously going to speak out about this because if you don't, you know, you can disappear if you don't show up in the search rankings or in0 the trending topics or whatever. But at the same time, I don't think government regulation is the answer. So there has to be another way.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. Mollie, we talked about this earlier. There's a thought that given the enormity of these corporations, and as Howie said and Dinesh pointed out, this is a public square today. This is the equivalent of what, you know, we used to see in the old town square with people with a bull horn.</p><p>And so could there be a movement to treat them more like public utilities, so they have some quasi, you know, government oversight of these entities or would that open up a total can of worms perhaps in the other direction at some point?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I personally am not a fan of regulation as an answer to this situation, but these companies absolutely have sometimes huge market share, the percentage of which would make standard oil blush. They are cognizant that they are going to make the government want to weigh in.</p><p>Just because though they're not governmental entities does not mean they aren't threats to free expression. In the same way that people get mad when President Trump criticizes the media because they claim that that's a threat to free expression. It's also a threat when big tech is telling people what they can and can't say.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right guys. Thank you so much. And wild speculation becomes a media manufactured frenzy over the Mueller investigation. Details on the latest desperate play with Alan Dershowitz, next.</p><p>INGRAHAM: If you've been watching other news anchors and pundits over the last day, you may think they sound like a bunch of kids on Christmas Eve. Now, why am I saying that?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST: You made it to Friday. It is the beginning of the Labor Day weekend and talk heating up that special counsel Robert Mueller could drop an August surprise.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Axios looking at speculation over whether Bob Mueller may actually make some sort of an announcement today.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's hot speculation among the president's lawyers that today might be a day of action for Robert Mueller.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, today's not quite over yet, but it's a nice serving of wild unsourced speculation on a Friday. Come on, guys, the news isn't that boring today. There's a lot happening. But are the president's critics grasping at any straws over the Mueller probe at this point?</p><p>Joining us now to analyze is Alan Dershowitz, author of the big bestseller \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump.\" We're also joined by Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney. Great to see both of you. Professor Dershowitz, that is quite amusing.</p><p>I've been hearing, it's coming, it's coming, there's something coming. I don't think Mueller's office is leaking anything. They've been pretty tight. So, is this just, you know, a case of desperate wishful thinking on the part of the media?</p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW: I think they thought that we're now two months away from the beginning really of the election. And Justice Department regulations say you shouldn't have matters that might interfere with voting or interfere with the election or put a thumb on the scale of voting within two months. So, this was a time when maybe something would have happened.</p><p>But look, I think today what's happened is news reporting has become part of the adversary system. Kendall and I are used to the adversary system. He's one of the world's great lawyers. He was my lawyer, in fact. And he and I both understand the adversary system.</p><p>One side presents its view of the facts, the other side presents its view of the facts, then you have a judge or a jury decides. That's what's happening with journalism today. And wishful thinking substitutes often for capital analysis.</p><p>INGRAHAM: And, Kendall, we're going to play -- we have a couple of different George Stephanopoulos sound bites. We'll play the second one where again -- this guy has been around for a while now. He used to work for the Clinton's obviously, but he's been around for a while, but this is what constitutes reporting today. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST: The New York Attorney General has filed suite against the Trump Foundation which could lead to a criminal referral. The Manhattan District Attorney also considering charges against the Trump organization. Trump facing lawsuits in Maryland and D.C. over the constitution of (inaudible) clause.</p><p>And of course special counsel Robert Mueller investigating possible collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. The bog question going forward, will any of these investigations lay the groundwork for impeachment proceedings in Congress?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. And we're reporting it breathlessly like this is all new stuff. Kendall</p><p>KENDALL COFFEY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes, I mean, I've never seen a speculation become so intoxicating to the media. I have to say by the way as in aside. Alan Dershowitz is the greatest legal talent in America and a personal hero of mine.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Oh, you guys are too much. You guys are too much.</p><p>COFFEY: Alan is -- Alan speaks for himself. He is magnificent. But let me talk about the election because they're not supposed to drop bombshells on the midterm. Who knows if there's any bombshells to drop? And let's also recognize that the election is coming up very fast. If there's a two-month standard years ago, early voting in Florida, pretty important state, starts around October 27th.</p><p>Overseas absentees go out next month and by October, beginning of October, domestic absentees go out. So, I don't think there is any bombshell that they are rolling out anytime soon, but from the standpoint of avoiding interference with an election, I think the deadline has passed.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right. Professor Dershowitz, the guy who's already in the middle of the Lanny Davis-Trump Tower story anonymous source controversy, Jim Sciutto, who a name I always mispronounce. He also weighed in on the speculation. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOIST: You used the term constitutional crisis and that phrase has been uttered a number of times and warned about on a number of things. In this environment, though, would it really be received that way, right? Because arguably the president has shirked constitutional responsibility, certainly broken norms a number of times, frankly without consequence.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Broken norms. Now we're at broken norms, Alan.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I just don't agree with that. Well, you know, the system of checks and balances is working very, very effectively. The courts are striking down some executive orders, upholding some. The media is critical of the president, some supporting the president. The academy is generally putting pressure against the president. Churches, business, everybody is involved in checking and balancing everybody else.</p><p>Democracy is working. This is not a constitutional crisis. If the president is subpoenaed, he'll go to court. And if he goes to court he may win, he may lose. And if he loses he will comply with the orders of the court. This is the way Madison had in mind when he created our awkward system of checks and balances, which was not designed to promote efficiency, but to avoid tyranny. It's working.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Kendall, I'd say I'm not sure Madison had a special counsel in mind. I might beg to differ with the professor there. I don't know about that. To me it seems like this has gone way beyond a check and a balance. Check and balance was impeachment and conviction of a sentence. I'm not sure a special counsel is what any of our framers intended.</p><p>But I want to run another topic because I have you two gentlemen here. I would like to get your thought on another Mueller-related tip. Two sources told Fox News' Catherine Herridge, that DOJ's Bruce Ohr kept a Mueller deputy in the loop about anti-Trump Steele dossier. So, in other word, does that endanger Mueller's ethical standing? I'll go to kendall on that.</p><p>COFFEY: Well, it's troubling, isn't it? I mean, if you think about -- and whether it splashes over to Bob Mueller is a different question. But it's obvious that Bruce Ohr's wife was working for a private company funded by Democrats. Some of my best friends are Democrats (inaudible), but nevertheless, that is a glaring conflict of interest.</p><p>And what interactions he had with others, which were frankly outside of his immediate duties as the director of OCDETF, which focuses on drug trafficking organizations, its also in (inaudible). So it raises a lot of questions. DOJ in my mind has not done a satisfactory job of explaining it. They're really effective at investigating others, but when they go under the microscope, sometimes we don't get a lot of clarity.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, Alan, at the end of the week here, any more thoughts on Bruce Ohr as a close door testimony this week when his name has been occupying a lot of air time, for obvious reasons with his connection with Christopher Steele. His wife of course works at Fusion GPS. You know the drill.</p><p>DERSHOWITZ: Well, I was prepared to give Bruce Ohr the presumption of innocence. He was a student at Harvard Law School. Everybody tells me he's a really good guy. And the thing that really put me away from Ohr, maybe overcame the pure presumption of innocence, is the presence of his wife at a lunch or breakfast or whatever it was, meeting where obviously he was trying to obtain information in an official capacity and his wife was working for a private company.</p><p>I do think that the inspector general now has to really look into that relationship. And I trust the inspector general. I think he's one of the very few people who come away from all of this looking very good. And I would leave it to the inspector general to give us a thorough investigation or good answer as to the relationship between Bruce Ohr, his wife, the company, the Democrats, the Justice Department. It's very complicated.</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. And a musical legend's funeral turning political? And Ryan Gosling setting up a huge controversy around the American flag and his new Neil Armstrong biopic. All that in \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo.</p><p>MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS HOST: We're live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Marianne Rafferty. John McCain receiving the highest honor from Congress today, lying in state in the capitol rotunda. The Arizona senator is just the 30th person in the nation's history to receive this honor joining a distinguished list that includes President Abraham Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan. Members of Congress gave tribute during today's ceremony after which members of the public were also allowed to pay their respects.</p><p>President Trump pushing for a new deal with Canada, but negotiations with Canada are off to a rocky start. The Toronto star today saying it was given off the record remarks from President Trump where he said he refused to compromise with Canada. President Trump called the leak a serious violation, but added that at least Canada knows where it stands.</p><p>I'm Marianne Rafferty. Now back to the INGRAHAM ANGLE.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's Friday, and you know what that means.</p><p>Ryan Gosling's new Neil Armstrong biopic has set off a huge controversy and a boycott is under way. For more on that and the political edge of Aretha Franklin's funeral, we're joined by \"New York Times\" bestselling author of the \"Will Wilder\" series, and FOX News contributor, Raymond Arroyo. Now, Ryan Gosling, Raymond, he's such an affable, nice guy. It sounds like such an interesting biopic, astronaut. Why could this be possibly in any way cantankerous or controversial?</p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Laura, they decided not to show Neil Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon, which is of course a fact of his life. Now, their reasoning for doing this, Gosling says in an interview around the Venice film festival, is this, and we'll put it up on the screen. He says, \"I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement, and that's how we chose to view it. So I don't think that Neil viewed himself as an American hero. From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.\"</p><p>Now, I don't understand how planting a flag on the moon in any way contradicts his being a humble hero or being reluctant to embrace that moniker as the hero.</p><p>INGRAHAM: It's another way of trashing patriotism. It's another way of moving beyond the nationalism or nationalistic spirit, fervor of the moment. And Chuck Yeager tweeted out, Raymond, who obviously knew Neil Armstrong well, he basically threw some water on what Gosling said, that he wouldn't like that flag, he mentioned, he didn't consider it an American achievement. It's ridiculous.</p><p>ARROYO: My feeling is, if you're doing a biopic, stick to the facts. He planted an American flag. Plant an American flag. Now there's a boycott movement, a #boycottfirstmanmovement. And this thing is sparking all sorts of outrage, and it's not even out yet.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes. What's that on his space outfit there? I think that's an American flag. Yes, Chuck Yeager said, not the Chuck I knew, basically, he's 95 years old, and he still had it in him. Yes, look at that flag on his astronaut uniform there. Come on.</p><p>All right, Raymond, what else is happening? We had kind of dueling funerals today. It was something on television. You had the John McCain funeral and then you had the -- or memorial service. He was lying in state at the capital. Then you Aretha Franklin funeral in Detroit.</p><p>ARROYO: Two great Americans, a musical legend, a statesman, both being honored. But both these events in some ways, particularly Aretha Franklin's funeral, turned very political. Here is Al Sharpton at the queen of soul's funeral in Detroit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. AL SHARPTON: On Sunday on my show I misspelled \"respect,\" and a a lot of you all corrected me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SHARPTON: Now I want you all to help me correct President Trump to teach him what it means.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SHARPTON: When word had went out that Ms. Franklin had passed, Trump said she used to work for me. No, she used to perform for you. She worked for us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: I don't know why they have to politicize everything, but we see this across American life. People just want to turn sports, now even the great celebration of a life, a musical legend, the queen of soul, it's being twisted and turned into a political rally.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Raymond, no, no, this was so gratuitous. And, again, Aretha Franklin, one of the great American voices of all time. Didn't she get an award from George W. Bush? I guess she was a Democrat, but she didn't seem like an overtly political person. Maybe I missed that. Maybe I wasn't aware of that. But it just seemed completely out of step. And then you had Farrakhan up on stage. You had Jesse Jackson, but Farrakhan was an interesting person to have there on the same stage as Bill Clinton and other luminaries.</p><p>ARROYO: Ariana Grande took the stage, Chaka Khan. This was \"The Voice\" meets \"Showtime at the Apollo.\" It was unbelievable. Everybody trying to top one another. And as you said, it was a rather interesting backdrop to Ariana Grande. And it looks like Farrakhan and Bill Clinton got quite an eyeful.</p><p>But here's my larger problem with this. Rather than focus on the individual whose life is being celebrated, it turns into everybody elbowing each other to get their moment on the stage. Even Maxine Waters managed to barge into this celebration. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Councilwoman -- I'm sorry, congresswoman who has been attacked like never before because she's a strong black woman. Congresswoman Maxine Waters from southside L.A., South Central.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everybody just point over there. Tell her, we've got your back. Come on, say it so everybody will hear you out there. We've got your back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO: But Maxine during the Wakanda salute there from \"Black Panther.\" So everybody got their moment in the spotlight. You know, Laura, my problem with this is both of these funerals had become television events. Multi-venues, star-studded lineups, they really are made for TV events. And my concern is we're going to see people ahead of time booking the rights to their own funeral so that the networks can get -- Netflix announces Cher's funeral. They've got the exclusive right. I don't see how this serves the end of celebrating a life and bringing people together. We're using great lives to divide Americans, and that's not --</p><p>INGRAHAM: Some mean person on Facebook said something like, Aretha Franklin's memorial service was so great that it's been picked up for ten episodes on Netflix. I almost fell over. But, OK, I guess it was on for four or five hours. But, my goodness, it was star-studded and it did get political.</p><p>ARROYO: Six hours.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Six hours, that's all. OK. And Raymond, thanks so much.</p><p>And as the NFL season prepares to kick off, there's new data on just how many Americans side with President Trump over the National Anthem protest. Why it should send chills through the league, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I know you well. You love our country. You're proud of our history. And you always respect our great American flag.</p><p>We are standing up for the heroes who protect America. We are proudly standing up for our National Anthem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: Well, that was President Trump in Evansville, Indiana, last night. And when the NFL season is ready to kick off, the National Anthem protests are yet again taking center field, pun intended. The league has plenty of reason to be concerned. A new \"Wall Street Journal\"/NBC News poll finds that 54 percent of voters think that kneeling during the anthem is not appropriate. And that's compared to 43 percent who say it's a fair way to protest racial inequality.</p><p>Joining me now with their reactions, Kevin Jackson is an author and a FOX News contributor, and Antjuan Seawright is a Democratic strategist. Gentlemen, it's great to see you tonight. Antjuan, let's start with you. The numbers aren't hugely disparate there, a majority saying the National Anthem, kneeling is not appropriate. But there's a sizable number of people saying it's fine, it doesn't really bother them. It's not clear that this is probably good, ultimately, for NFL viewership, though, Antjuan. I'm ready to go to the Notre Dame game tomorrow night. And college football is where it's at. I'm sorry. NFL football, I just know a lot of people who are just not all that jazzed on it. And I think this is part of the reason. Even if it's not intended to be disrespectful to the military, a lot of military veterans do feel that way. And I think that ends up hurting the whole experience for just a lot of folks.</p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, Laura, a couple things. I think sometimes what gets lost in the conversation is why this even started. This started because Kaepernick felt like black and brown people were mistreated at the hands of law enforcement. That's number one.</p><p>Number two, when you look at polls, and I'll take this scenario or any other scenario where people are being surveyed, it's all about how the question is asked, who is doing the asking, and how the question is being framed. But if you look at the NFL and you look at the bottom line, their revenue numbers, their revenue increased by five percent last year, not to mention the $50 million Amazon deal for streaming that was signed.</p><p>And so while these people may say they may not agree with the protests, I tend to believe that they still will watch the NFL. And football, like any other sport, is one of the very few things that most people, Democrats, Republicans, black or white, rich or poor, agree on. I just hate it's turned into a political football, no pun intended.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, well, Kevin, I don't think anyone is trying to make it political. I think people --</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Well, the president is, Laura.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Well, I think the president is standing up for what he believes in, which is just like the folks who are kneeling. They're kneeling for what they believe in, and the president is standing up for what he believes in. You can't have it one way and say this whole side gets to do this when the president can't talk about what he believes. Kevin, your thoughts on this?</p><p>KEVIN JACKSON: As Jerry Glanville said one time, NFL is going to stand for \"Not For Long.\" He can quote all the numbers and statics he wants. The NFL is in triage. And I don't know why they're on this self-defeating path, but they like being on it. And it reminds me of what the Democrats are doing in going against Donald Trump in many ways.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Here we go.</p><p>JACKSON: At the end of the day -- yes, here we go. You're exactly right. Here we go. When you look at what's going on with what Donald Trump is standing up, the flag, he's standing up for veterans. By the way, he's also standing up for police. I've got a film coming out called \"Bleeding Blue,\" and one of police in there says, hey, when something happens in your neighborhood, are you going to call a cop or are you going to call Colin Kaepernick? And he's exactly right. The police are going to have to do their jobs, and Colin Kaepernick, whether he likes it or not, he started a trend. And, Laura, I don't know what the statistics are, but I'll tell you, the overwhelming number of Americans believe in the flag, believe in the Anthem, believe in standing for it, and believe in the military, and believe in the police.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: You can take a knee in protest but also stand up for believing in America and everything she stands for.</p><p>JACKSON: Take a knee for the people killed in Chicago.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Again, I'll say, you can focus on why this even started, the fact that African-American, black and brown people are five times more likely to be mishandled or killed at the hands of law enforcement. This is why that started. And so while you can see these people are not pro- America, look, my father served in the military. My father served so that these players would have the right to take their knee.</p><p>JACKSON: More black people are killed by other black people than cops. And you can argue this as much as you want. Randy Moss wore a tie to get inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame and it had 12 black people's names on it that expanded over a decade. This idea that cops are out hunting and killing black people is ridiculous.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: No one ever said they were out hunting and killing black people. I said they were mishandled at the hands of law enforcement. Statistics will prove that to be true.</p><p>INGRAHAM: We've got to move on. We've got other topics we want to hit while I have you both here. So I want to get your reaction to this. Last night CNN's Don Lemon took a pretty nasty shot at Kanye West over Kanye's support for President Trump. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: It's like a word salad where you realize that Kanye West, entitled to his own opinion, but is not very bright and not very -- when it comes -- I'm talking about this position, not overall, but when it comes to these issues, he's not clued in. He needs to read about it before he speaks about it. I'm not saying he's not a bright person. I take that back. That's not what I meant. But when it comes to this particular issue, he needs to look at a book, read some history, and understand what he's talking about.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's pretty condescending coming from Don Lemon, who himself has had a few wobbly moments. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I love you, too, but we really don't need to see what's about to happen here. I love you, Don. No, keep it closed. OK, I'm cutting you off after this one. Should I cut him off?</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: A lot of people have been asking about that, about black holes and on and on and on, and all of these conspiracy theories. Let's look at this. Noah says, \"What else can you think about? Black hole? Bermuda Triangle.\" And then Deji says \"Just like the movie \"Lost?\" And of course it's also referencing \"The Twilight Zone,\" which has a very similar plot. That's what people are saying. I know it's preposterous. But is it preposterous?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: He was talking in that last sound bite about the Malaysian jet that disappeared, crashed, but could have been pulled up by a black hole. I mean, I guess. I'm being charitable tonight. I guess.</p><p>JACKSON: You don't have to have Don Lemon being drunk to showcase his lunacy. Just watch his program any night.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Because you don't agree with him.</p><p>JACKSON: No. I don't agree with you, but you're sitting here and I'm not interrupting you. Look, at the end of the day, when you look at what he said about Kanye West, he's trying to correct a grown man who dare have an opinion that differs from his. And, oh, by the way, Donald Lemon, Kanye happens to be right. There are many reasons for us to be looking at Donald Trump through the prism, it certainly is black folks, to be looking to Donald Trump as a person who's done a lot more for blacks than Barack Obama.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Oh, Jesus Christ, man.</p><p>JACKSON: And people don't want to admit this. And for Don Lemon and this particular gentleman to keep talking about Donald Trump as if he's some bad guy, or Kanye West who is bringing out what we're calling the Kanye effect is ridiculous. More black people are waking up because of Kanye West and his comments, because they're tired of being demonized, because --</p><p>INGRAHAM: All right, let's go to Antjuan. Antjuan?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Laura, that sounds all good. What Don Lemon did -- he corrected his statement.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Antjuan, Antjuan.</p><p>JACKSON: I know, but I'm going to interrupt him like he did me, Laura.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: What Don Lemon corrected was Kaney's position, and Kanye even apologized and walked it back, his comment about enslavement a couple of days ago on a national radio show because he was actually wrong. And I appreciate him taking his comments back.</p><p>JACKSON: He wasn't wrong.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Look, I am not for criticizing someone for having an opinion because we all have one.</p><p>JACKSON: Yes, you are.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, why not?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT: Make sure when you speak of a certain instance, make sure that the facts are very, very clear. And I'm glad that Kanye West was able to be man enough to walk back his comments.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, we've got to roll. All right, we've got to roll, guys. Thanks so much for joining us tonight.</p><p>I have a question, though. Is President Trump about to prove his naysayers wrong and score a huge victory for America? Well, how about in trade? Back in a moment.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Canada feeling the heat from President Trump over a new trade deal. Tensions spilled out in the public view throughout the day under a looming deadline. Take a listen to Canada's minister of foreign affairs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: We are committed to speaking for Canada to a deal which is a good deal for Canada, not just any deal. We are very good as Canadians at finding win-win compromises. At the end of the day, though, we are only going to sign a deal that's good for Canada.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM: Now, a final agreement was not yet inked, reached today. But talks are set to resume next Wednesday. And my sources are telling me they're very close.</p><p>Joining us now to analyze is Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy, along with Democratic strategist Roger Risk. Great to see you both. Roger, let's start with you. This issue of trade is something I've been writing about for, I don't know, about 20 years. And Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, Luis Videgaray who was on our show exclusively on Monday night, and Freeland were all behind closed doors today. They're hammering this out. It's very complicated. The agricultural subsidies that Canada gives, especially to its dairy farmers, are incredibly important to Quebec. And that's a sticking point. But my sources are telling me they're extremely close. And no one wants Canada to walk away from the table. Canada doesn't and obviously the administration doesn't. Your reaction tonight?</p><p>ROGER FISK, FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL: I think it's almost the tale of two trade talks. I find some encouraging elements to how the administration has conducted itself with the Mexican set of the trade talks. That's been more sober, more process-driven. They've been working on it for a year. I hope that the success of that as we move forward starts to guide how the president views the resources around him, starts to maybe trust in some of the professionals that are there to help him.</p><p>The Canadian discussion is obviously much more accelerated and I think is going to take more time maybe than what we think right now. And then there's other factors that are going to make this more difficult as we go ahead. We have the 90-day window with Congress. If you look at the letter that the Senate majority leader sent to the president with 35 of his colleagues, I think there's every indication that Congress wants to get into the details of this. And then you're going to have a change of administrations in Mexico.</p><p>Overall, I think we are actually closer to the starting line than we are to the finish line. I wouldn't want the administration to start spiking the football. There's more work to do, but this is actually encouraging.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Yes, I mean, Sean, Congressman Duffy, this is something that the left, never Trump, they were all against it. Chamber of Commerce never wanted this. They said it was never going to happen. It is going to happen. I will count my chickens. It is going to happen and it's probably going to happen next week. And no one thought Trump could do it. No one thought Trump could do it. Your reaction tonight.</p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY, (R) WISCONSIN: They had no faith in a great negotiator, Donald Trump. Let's be clear what's happening, Laura. When Donald Trump engaged Mexico, they recognized that there was some unfair practices between the two countries. They sat down and they worked them out with us, and it's a winner for both of us, but it's a winner for the American worker. From all my contacts inside the administration, the Canadians, they've been really hard to deal with. They're using America as a piggy bank, as Donald Trump will say, and they want to keep that piggy bank alive and well, sucking cash and jobs out of our country.</p><p>And Donald Trump, thank God he's standing up for the Wisconsin dairy. We want to sell our products all over the world. We can't sell them into Canada. They put a 200 to 300 percent tariff on our products. Laura, what happens if we said, OK, you put a 300 percent tariff on our milk. We'll put a 300 percent tariff on your autos that you're producing and trying to sell here. See how that goes over in Canada. Unfair.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Roger, what happened in this NAFTA set of talks is Canada was involved for almost the entire last year except for the last two months, because then they thought, oh, they're never going to agree, Mexico and the United States. Then we'll stand with Mexico against the United States and we'll get more out of it. Lo and behold, Mexico struck a deal with the United States and Canada was odd man out.</p><p>So Freeland flies in at the last minute and says, OK, maybe we can work something out. But that was a brilliant move. I think they underestimated the strength of the relationship forged by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, the entire U.S. TR team. These guys have been working around the clock, literally around the clock over the last 10 days. And I don't think people fully understood the strength of this new relationship with Mexico, presidential tweets notwithstanding.</p><p>FISK: Well, I think it's a great indication that the president should be able to rely on some of the experts he has. And I hope he starts to do that in some of the other challenges that he has on his plate. The issues with Mexico, some of the progress that was made with the auto parts and where the assembly points are located and things like that I think are great. I think you have to agree, there's still more work to be done. This is not the end of the whole process.</p><p>DUFFY: The left wants us to look to the globalists that were there before for their expertise. Donald Trump has a great gut himself, but we want those who are going to negotiation for America, for American dairy, for American manufacturers.</p><p>INGRAHAM: Guys, thank you so much. We're out of time, but fantastic conversation. We're going to be right back.</p><p>INGRAHAM: That's all the time we have tonight. I want to give a big thanks to a team out here in our Chicago bureau who helped get together the show over the last few days. It was a Herculean effort. And don't forget to tweet me @IngrahamAngle. Have a wonderful Labor Day weekend, and be sure to watch a special addition of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE on Labor Day. It's the best of \"Seen and Unseen\" with my partner in crime, Raymond Arroyo.</p><p>And until then, have a wonderful weekend, fly your flag, hang out with your family and friends. Up next, Shannon Bream. Goodnight form Chicago.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018083101cb257</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T5D-JSW1-JB20-G23M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 31, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fake News</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Twitter</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Censorship</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mueller investigations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CNUK</classCode><className>US LABOR DAY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLCU</classCode><className>FAKE NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Have a look at the deep state. I appreciate it.  Have a wonderful weekend. \"THE INGRAHAM ANGLE\" is up next. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Good evening from Chicago. I'm Laura  Ingraham and welcome to THE INGRAHAM ANGLE Special: Trump's Week of  Battles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump is a fighter. There's no doubt about that, and it's a good  thing because he's facing attacks on multiple fronts. In the next hour,  we're going to tell you how the media are putting stories out, some of them  blatant lies to undermine the president's agenda. Alan Dershowitz will be  here to discuss Trump's latest fight with the Justice Department.  You  won't believe what we're learning about DOJ official Bruce Ohr. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Raymond Arroyo is here with his \"Friday Folly\" segment, where he's going to  tell us of how the funeral of a music legend at times became a political  rally. </p><p>Plus, we've got updates about NFL players kneeling during the anthem and  President Trump's efforts to remake the NAFTA agreement, all coming up. </p><p>But first, our top story, CNN caught red-handed. As we've been telling you  this week, CNN's blockbuster story last month about Michael Cohen was dead  wrong. The network went wild with an anonymously sourced report that claim  Cohen was prepared to tell Mueller's team that President Trump knew in  advance about that infamous 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump,  Jr. and a Russian lawyer. </p><p>We now know that CNN lied about Cohen's attorney, Lanny Davis being a  source for the piece. And here's the kicker. Davis now says the story is  false. But still CNN is sticking with its story. And \"Business Insider\" is  reporting that the network isn't planning on revealing its alleged second  source. Huh? </p><p>And the left wonders why Trump's fake news narrative is working. Joining me  now for reaction is \"The Federalist\" Mollie Hemingway who's also a Fox News  contributor, Howie Kurtz, host of Fox News' \"Media Buzz\" which airs at  11:00 a.m. on Sunday, and Dinesh D'Souza, a filmmaker whose new film \"Death  of a Nation\" is in theaters now and will be in a special showing all  weekend long over Labor Day.</p><p>Dinesh, let's start with you here. This is wild. I mean, CNN is you know,  \"This is CNN,\" the James Earl Jones booming voice. At one time back in the  '80s when CNN started, it was considered kind of a gold standard of this  new2 type of journalism. Where does it stand now after this Lanny Davis  story, the complete bungle by the network? </p><p>DINES D'SOUZA, FILMMAKER;  Well, one can almost think back nostalgically to  the '80s when CNN would have shows like \"Crossfire\" where they would have a  liberal, a conservative, Matt Buchanan on one side, Michael Kinsley on the  other. That's not the CNN of today. Now, it's one thing to spin the news  and interpret it in a manner that is consistent with your own ideological  agenda. </p><p>It's a completely different thing to have a story I which you are reporting  facts. The facts are exposed as false and you dig your heels in and say  that they're true anyway. I mean, this is taking fake news to a new level  and it is setting, you may say, almost a new standard of deception that I  think will haunt CNN for a while. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes. Dinesh, your movie, \"Death of a Nation.\" This is like death  of journalism. Howie Kurtz, I know that cables compete with each other and  it can be pretty rough and tumble and one side -- I get that. But this is  unbelievable. </p><p>They claimed that they tried to, what, contact Lanny Davis initially with  the story and that he declined to comment but it turns out he was initially  the source of the story. I mean, this story gets worse and worse the more  people marinate on it. </p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, FOX NEWS MEDIA BUZZ SHOW HOST:  Yes, but Lanny Davis has told  me that he never confirmed this allegation for CNN and then he sort of  outed himself as a source. Look, CNN is trying to defend the indefensible. </p><p>It will not discuss on the air, will not discuss publicly what went wrong  with the story about what Michael Cohen knew that Michael Cohen's lawyer  now says it's not true. And this one sentence we standby our story isn't  working because the network is accusing the president of lying about his  knowledge about that Trump Tower meeting. </p><p>I'll tell you one other thing, Laura. If the White House had done something  like this, throw out an incendiary charge and then stand by as the story  begun to crumble, CNN and lots of other news organizations would be  hammering the place for stone walling. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Mollie, and it's not just how they're stone walling tonight,  it's how damaging the particular allegation was that they ran with,  apparently with some source they said was Lanny Davis, which ended up kind  of not being Lanny Davis. So it's the underlying allegation about that  Trump Tower meeting which we know would have been at the crux of the  Mueller investigation. </p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, FOX NES CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, they claimed it was a  bombshell when they first reported the story. And as the story is falling  apart, I think part of the reason why they're unable to take responsibility  for flubbing the story is that they hyped it so much. But it's really part  of a pattern of behavior for CNN as it relates to the Russia conclusion  conspiracy theory that they have been pushing for a year and a half. </p><p>And there had been other stories that they claim to have multiple anonymous  sources that also fell through. You remember that they claim that Don, Jr.  had advance knowledge of a WikiLeaks dump while they claim they have  multiple sources, it turned out not to be true and they never explained how  their multiple sources got it wrong. </p><p>They also claimed that James Comey would contradict Donald Trump's  testimony about how James Comey had told him three times he wasn't under  investigation. But we all saw that testimony. He admitted that he had told  President Trump that three times, just as President Trump said. They never  explained how they got that wrong. And these are just three examples of  many stories that they have gotten wrong about the Russia collusion theory. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now Dinesh, CNN is not the only network under fire for botching  a huge story getting it wrong. But according to now new reports, the top  brass at NBC tried to put the kibosh on Ronan Farrow's bombshell -- real  bombshell story about Harvey Weinstein's sexual predation, basically  forcing Ronan Farrow to take the story to \"The New Yorker\" magazine where  everybody knows by now he ultimately won a Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>And tonight the rumors are also swirling that NBC News chairman, Andy Lack,  is on the hot seat. And this is after President Trump weighed in on NBC's  troubles last night. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Remember the lines from NBC  which is probably worse than CNN. But the word is they're firing the head  of NBC. What a great thing to do. How smart. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Dinesh, this is unreal. Harvey Weinstein has a lot of power.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  I think if the CNN story was a lie of commission, the NBC story  is a lie of omission. Now, just think about how powerful their ideology  would have to be because, remember, this is actually not a lie that would  have helped Trump. This actually is a lie to cover up a principle, the  principle of sexual harassment, the principle of sexual abuse, which is  actually a principle on the left. </p><p>And so essentially this principle could only be trumped by a greater  principle on the left. And the greater principle on the left here is we  have to protect our own team. There are very powerful people on the left,  George Soros, Harvey Weinstein, and it is an unwritten rule in a sense of  progressive journalism that these people are untouchable and that you have  to run defense for them and run protection for them. I believe that was  what was going on at NBC. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yeah, he thought he was untouchable and Harvey Weinstein thought  everyone else was touchable, that's the problem here. Howie Kurtz, this is  another wild story. Harvey Weinstein had enormous amount of influence in  Hollywood, enormous amount of political clout with all the fundraisers he  hosted, the money he raised, and deep friendships within the peacock. </p><p>I mean, he and Andy Lack I hear were very good friends. What happened to  the \"we treat all women the same as men. We believe in women's rights\"? And  when this Ronan Farrow, a young journalist was hot on the trail of this  story, general counsel was saying, \"you better back off or we're going to  smear you.\" Again, these are reported allegations by I guess the producers  of Farrow's work. </p><p>KURTZ:  Right. Well, that particular allegation is denied by NBC and I  don't know how much pressure Weinstein brought to (inaudible) but it  remains a huge embarrassment for NBC that after eight months of (inaudible)  let Ronan Farrow walk out the door with that prize-winning story that  essentially launched the MeToo Movement. </p><p>And now you have Farrows investigative reporter -- producer, excuse me --  who just left NBC saying this is a massive breach of journalistic integrity  by NBC, but NBC was never enthusiastic about the story. NBC claims he  didn't have enough and then (inaudible) willing to do on camera, but two  months later, this meticulously reported piece appears in \"The New Yorker\"  and it looked like NBC just didn't have the guts to take on Harvey  Weinstein. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  But what's your gut on this, Howie? Do you think this producer  is blowing smoke here? I mean, it sounds a little odd to me, doesn't it?  Like, oh, we didn't have enough -- they said today he didn't have enough  sources. It wasn't well sourced enoghh. I think he was working on it and  they came down on him and said -- </p><p>KURTZ:  Oh yes. When you're a reporter, you know whether your bosses are  enthusiastic particularly about a sensitive investigative piece. NBC was  not. NBC was willing to let him walk out the door and so nothing can change  the fact that NBC blew this one big time. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And Mollie, before we let you go, this story also bled into  Andrew Cuomo because the report came out that he pulled back on an  investigation into Weinstein I guess after what Weinstein's attorney gave a  $25,000 donation. So, it even bleeds into that part of the political world. </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  It's really clear that we see a lot of stories that get  suppressed or elevated depending on political affiliations or friendships  and that's really inappropriate. We want to believe that our legal  institutions and our media institutions will tell the story regardless of  where it takes them or apply justice regardless and that is a problem that  we're facing in this country right now with different standards for  different people. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right. We have one more topic. We have time for that one  final topic. President Trump last night also shared his thoughts on the  current censorship controversy with big tech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  Look at social media. It's a thing called free speech rights. You  look at Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media giants, and I've  made it clear that we as a country cannot tolerate political censorship,  blacklisting, and rigged search results. And you know it can go the other  way also. We will not let large corporations silence conservative voices. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, the focus on this from President Trump and conservatives  may be having an effect. With reports like this one from the \"New York  Times\" stating that some Facebook employees are fighting against this  intolerant liberal culture. </p><p>Dinesh, you have written about this in books and spoken about this on  college campuses. The west coast, otherwise effectually (ph) known as the  left coast, especially in big tech, overwhelmingly left wing,  overwhelmingly probably voted for Hillary. And yet they say, oh, this is  just an algorithm. You're all floating conspiracy theories, but now you got  Facebook employees complaining about the mono-culture.</p><p>D'SOUZA:  This I think is very scary. So many conservatives fled to social  media to escape the bias of the mainstream media. And now to discover this  effort to sort of take people and make them into digital non-persons, I  mean, one has to go back to all this (inaudible) George Orwell to find out  this kind of stuff going on now. </p><p>A lot of people say, well, gee, these are private companies. They should be  able to do whatever they want. But this is actually not true. If Google or  Facebook decided for example we're going to shadow ban blacks or we're  going to shadow ban Latinos. These companies would be shut down overnight.</p><p>They know that they can't do that and they wouldn't even dare, but  apparently with conservatives they feel like it's OK to have political  discrimination even though I don't see fundamentally the difference here  between political discrimination and discrimination on any other basis. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Howie, how big of an issue is this? I mean, I can tell when my  radio audience, it blows up the lines. Everyone wants to talk about it.  Everyone seems to have an experience with it. I know it seems anecdotal but  I find Bing by the way -- Bing is the best search engine -- the least  biased in Bing. For whatever reason, that's what I've discovered. Howie? </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Right. Well, it's a huge issue because social media is the new  public square. And Facebook and Twitter both have acknowledged that they  have a problem with instances of bias against conservatives. I think the  evidence against Google is a little less clear. </p><p>So President Trump and others on the right are obviously going to speak out  about this because if you don't, you know, you can disappear if you don't  show up in the search rankings or in0 the trending topics or whatever. But  at the same time, I don't think government regulation is the answer. So  there has to be another way. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes. Mollie, we talked about this earlier. There's a thought  that given the enormity of these corporations, and as Howie said and Dinesh  pointed out, this is a public square today. This is the equivalent of what,  you know, we used to see in the old town square with people with a bull  horn. </p><p>And so could there be a movement to treat them more like public utilities,  so they have some quasi, you know, government oversight of these entities  or would that open up a total can of worms perhaps in the other direction  at some point? </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I personally am not a fan of regulation as an answer to this  situation, but these companies absolutely have sometimes huge market share,  the percentage of which would make standard oil blush. They are cognizant  that they are going to make the government want to weigh in. </p><p>Just because though they're not governmental entities does not mean they  aren't threats to free expression. In the same way that people get mad when  President Trump criticizes the media because they claim that that's a  threat to free expression. It's also a threat when big tech is telling  people what they can and can't say. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right guys. Thank you so much. And wild speculation becomes  a media manufactured frenzy over the Mueller investigation. Details on the  latest desperate play with Alan Dershowitz, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  If you've been watching other news anchors and pundits over the  last day, you may think they sound like a bunch of kids on Christmas Eve.  Now, why am I saying that? </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>ANA CABRERA, CNN HOST:  You made it to Friday. It is the beginning of the  Labor Day weekend and talk heating up that special counsel Robert Mueller  could drop an August surprise. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Axios looking at speculation over whether Bob Mueller  may actually make some sort of an announcement today. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It's hot speculation among the president's lawyers that  today might be a day of action for Robert Mueller.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS) </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, today's not quite over yet, but it's a nice serving of  wild unsourced speculation on a Friday. Come on, guys, the news isn't that  boring today. There's a lot happening. But are the president's critics  grasping at any straws over the Mueller probe at this point? </p><p>Joining us now to analyze is Alan Dershowitz, author of the big bestseller  \"The Case Against Impeaching Trump.\" We're also joined by Kendall Coffey, a  former U.S. attorney. Great to see both of you. Professor Dershowitz, that  is quite amusing. </p><p>I've been hearing, it's coming, it's coming, there's something coming. I  don't think Mueller's office is leaking anything. They've been pretty  tight. So, is this just, you know, a case of desperate wishful thinking on  the part of the media? </p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ, PROFESSOR EMERITUS, HARVARD LAW:  I think they thought  that we're now two months away from the beginning really of the election.  And Justice Department regulations say you shouldn't have matters that  might interfere with voting or interfere with the election or put a thumb  on the scale of voting within two months. So, this was a time when maybe  something would have happened. </p><p>But look, I think today what's happened is news reporting has become part  of the adversary system. Kendall and I are used to the adversary system.  He's one of the world's great lawyers. He was my lawyer, in fact. And he  and I both understand the adversary system. </p><p>One side presents its view of the facts, the other side presents its view  of the facts, then you have a judge or a jury decides. That's what's  happening with journalism today. And wishful thinking substitutes often for  capital analysis. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  And, Kendall, we're going to play -- we have a couple of  different George Stephanopoulos sound bites. We'll play the second one  where again -- this guy has been around for a while now. He used to work  for the Clinton's obviously, but he's been around for a while, but this is  what constitutes reporting today. Let's watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC NEWS HOST:  The New York Attorney General has  filed suite against the Trump Foundation which could lead to a criminal  referral. The Manhattan District Attorney also considering charges against  the Trump organization. Trump facing lawsuits in Maryland and D.C. over the  constitution of (inaudible) clause. </p><p>And of course special counsel Robert Mueller investigating possible  collusion with Russia and obstruction of justice. The bog question going  forward, will any of these investigations lay the groundwork for  impeachment proceedings in Congress? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Nothing's changed. Nothing's changed. And we're reporting it  breathlessly like this is all new stuff. Kendall </p><p>KENDALL COFFEY, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, I mean, I've never seen a  speculation become so intoxicating to the media. I have to say by the way  as in aside. Alan Dershowitz is the greatest legal talent in America and a  personal hero of mine. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Oh, you guys are too much. You guys are too much.</p><p>COFFEY:  Alan is -- Alan speaks for himself. He is magnificent. But let me  talk about the election because they're not supposed to drop bombshells on  the midterm. Who knows if there's any bombshells to drop? And let's also  recognize that the election is coming up very fast. If there's a two-month  standard years ago, early voting in Florida, pretty important state, starts  around October 27th. </p><p>Overseas absentees go out next month and by October, beginning of October,  domestic absentees go out. So, I don't think there is any bombshell that  they are rolling out anytime soon, but from the standpoint of avoiding  interference with an election, I think the deadline has passed. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right. Professor Dershowitz, the guy who's already in the  middle of the Lanny Davis-Trump Tower story anonymous source controversy,  Jim Sciutto, who a name I always mispronounce. He also weighed in on the  speculation. Let's watch. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM SCIUTTO, CNN HOIST:  You used the term constitutional crisis and that  phrase has been uttered a number of times and warned about on a number of  things. In this environment, though, would it really be received that way,  right? Because arguably the president has shirked constitutional  responsibility, certainly broken norms a number of times, frankly without  consequence. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Broken norms. Now we're at broken norms, Alan. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I just don't agree with that. Well, you know, the system  of checks and balances is working very, very effectively. The courts are  striking down some executive orders, upholding some. The media is critical  of the president, some supporting the president. The academy is generally  putting pressure against the president. Churches, business, everybody is  involved in checking and balancing everybody else. </p><p>Democracy is working. This is not a constitutional crisis. If the president  is subpoenaed, he'll go to court. And if he goes to court he may win, he  may lose. And if he loses he will comply with the orders of the court. This  is the way Madison had in mind when he created our awkward system of checks  and balances, which was not designed to promote efficiency, but to avoid  tyranny. It's working. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Kendall, I'd say I'm not sure Madison had a special counsel in  mind. I might beg to differ with the professor there. I don't know about  that. To me it seems like this has gone way beyond a check and a balance.  Check and balance was impeachment and conviction of a sentence. I'm not  sure a special counsel is what any of our framers intended. </p><p>But I want to run another topic because I have you two gentlemen here. I  would like to get your thought on another Mueller-related tip. Two sources  told Fox News' Catherine Herridge, that DOJ's Bruce Ohr kept a Mueller  deputy in the loop about anti-Trump Steele dossier. So, in other word, does  that endanger Mueller's ethical standing? I'll go to kendall on that. </p><p>COFFEY:  Well, it's troubling, isn't it? I mean, if you think about -- and  whether it splashes over to Bob Mueller is a different question. But it's  obvious that Bruce Ohr's wife was working for a private company funded by  Democrats. Some of my best friends are Democrats (inaudible), but  nevertheless, that is a glaring conflict of interest. </p><p>And what interactions he had with others, which were frankly outside of his  immediate duties as the director of OCDETF, which focuses on drug  trafficking organizations, its also in (inaudible). So it raises a lot of  questions. DOJ in my mind has not done a satisfactory job of explaining it.  They're really effective at investigating others, but when they go under  the microscope, sometimes we don't get a lot of clarity. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, Alan, at the end of the week here, any more thoughts  on Bruce Ohr as a close door testimony this week when his name has been  occupying a lot of air time, for obvious reasons with his connection with  Christopher Steele. His wife of course works at Fusion GPS. You know the  drill. </p><p>DERSHOWITZ:  Well, I was prepared to give Bruce Ohr the presumption of  innocence. He was a student at Harvard Law School. Everybody tells me he's  a really good guy. And the thing that really put me away from Ohr, maybe  overcame the pure presumption of innocence, is the presence of his wife at  a lunch or breakfast or whatever it was, meeting where obviously he was  trying to obtain information in an official capacity and his wife was  working for a private company. </p><p>I do think that the inspector general now has to really look into that  relationship. And I trust the inspector general. I think he's one of the  very few people who come away from all of this looking very good. And I  would leave it to the inspector general to give us a thorough investigation  or good answer as to the relationship between Bruce Ohr, his wife, the  company, the Democrats, the Justice Department. It's very complicated. </p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, gentlemen, thank you so much. And a musical legend's  funeral turning political? And Ryan Gosling setting up a huge controversy  around the American flag and his new Neil Armstrong biopic. All that in  \"Friday Follies\" with Raymond Arroyo.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>MARIANNE RAFFERTY, FOX NEWS HOST:  We're live from America's News  Headquarters, I'm Marianne Rafferty. John McCain receiving the highest  honor from Congress today, lying in state in the capitol rotunda. The  Arizona senator is just the 30th person in the nation's history to receive  this honor joining a distinguished list that includes President Abraham  Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan. Members of Congress gave  tribute during today's ceremony after which members of the public were also  allowed to pay their respects.</p><p>President Trump pushing for a new deal with Canada, but negotiations with  Canada are off to a rocky start. The Toronto star today saying it was given  off the record remarks from President Trump where he said he refused to  compromise with Canada. President Trump called the leak a serious  violation, but added that at least Canada knows where it stands.</p><p>I'm Marianne Rafferty.  Now back to the INGRAHAM ANGLE.</p><p>INGRAHAM:   It's Friday, and you know what that means.  </p><p>Ryan Gosling's new Neil Armstrong biopic has set off a huge controversy and  a boycott is under way.  For more on that and the political edge of Aretha  Franklin's funeral, we're joined by \"New York Times\" bestselling author of  the \"Will Wilder\" series, and FOX News contributor, Raymond Arroyo.  Now,  Ryan Gosling, Raymond, he's such an affable, nice guy.  It sounds like such  an interesting biopic, astronaut.  Why could this be possibly in any way  cantankerous or controversial?  </p><p>RAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Laura, they decided not to show Neil  Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon, which is of course a fact  of his life.  Now, their reasoning for doing this, Gosling says in an  interview around the Venice film festival, is this, and we'll put it up on  the screen.  He says, \"I think this was widely regarded in the end as a  human achievement, and that's how we chose to view it.  So I don't think  that Neil viewed himself as an American hero.  From my interviews with his  family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite.  And we wanted  the film to reflect Neil.\"  </p><p>Now, I don't understand how planting a flag on the moon in any way  contradicts his being a humble hero or being reluctant to embrace that  moniker as the hero.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  It's another way of trashing patriotism.  It's another way of  moving beyond the nationalism or nationalistic spirit, fervor of the  moment.  And Chuck Yeager tweeted out, Raymond, who obviously knew Neil  Armstrong well, he basically threw some water on what Gosling said, that he  wouldn't like that flag, he mentioned, he didn't consider it an American  achievement.  It's ridiculous.  </p><p>ARROYO:  My feeling is, if you're doing a biopic, stick to the facts.  He  planted an American flag.  Plant an American flag.  Now there's a boycott  movement, a #boycottfirstmanmovement.  And this thing is sparking all sorts  of outrage, and it's not even out yet.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes.  What's that on his space outfit there?  I think that's an  American flag.  Yes, Chuck Yeager said, not the Chuck I knew, basically,  he's 95 years old, and he still had it in him.  Yes, look at that flag on  his astronaut uniform there.  Come on.  </p><p>All right, Raymond, what else is happening?  We had kind of dueling  funerals today.  It was something on television.  You had the John McCain  funeral and then you had the -- or memorial service.  He was lying in state  at the capital.  Then you Aretha Franklin funeral in Detroit.  </p><p>ARROYO:  Two great Americans, a musical legend, a statesman, both being  honored.  But both these events in some ways, particularly Aretha  Franklin's funeral, turned very political.  Here is Al Sharpton at the  queen of soul's funeral in Detroit.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REV. AL SHARPTON:  On Sunday on my show I misspelled \"respect,\" and a a lot  of you all corrected me.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SHARPTON:  Now I want you all to help me correct President Trump to teach  him what it means.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>SHARPTON:  When word had went out that Ms. Franklin had passed, Trump said  she used to work for me.  No, she used to perform for you.  She worked for  us.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO:  I don't know why they have to politicize everything, but we see  this across American life.  People just want to turn sports, now even the  great celebration of a life, a musical legend, the queen of soul, it's  being twisted and turned into a political rally.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Raymond, no, no, this was so gratuitous.  And, again, Aretha  Franklin, one of the great American voices of all time.  Didn't she get an  award from George W. Bush?  I guess she was a Democrat, but she didn't seem  like an overtly political person.  Maybe I missed that.  Maybe I wasn't  aware of that.  But it just seemed completely out of step.  And then you  had Farrakhan up on stage.  You had Jesse Jackson, but Farrakhan was an  interesting person to have there on the same stage as Bill Clinton and  other luminaries.  </p><p>ARROYO:  Ariana Grande took the stage, Chaka Khan.  This was \"The Voice\"  meets \"Showtime at the Apollo.\" It was unbelievable.  Everybody trying to  top one another.  And as you said, it was a rather interesting backdrop to  Ariana Grande.  And it looks like Farrakhan and Bill Clinton got quite an  eyeful.</p><p>But here's my larger problem with this.  Rather than focus on the  individual whose life is being celebrated, it turns into everybody elbowing  each other to get their moment on the stage.  Even Maxine Waters managed to  barge into this celebration.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Councilwoman -- I'm sorry, congresswoman who has been  attacked like never before because she's a strong black woman.   Congresswoman Maxine Waters from southside L.A., South Central.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everybody just point over there.  Tell her, we've got  your back.  Come on, say it so everybody will hear you out there.  We've  got your back.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ARROYO:  But Maxine during the Wakanda salute there from \"Black Panther.\"   So everybody got their moment in the spotlight.  You know, Laura, my  problem with this is both of these funerals had become television events.   Multi-venues, star-studded lineups, they really are made for TV events.   And my concern is we're going to see people ahead of time booking the  rights to their own funeral so that the networks can get -- Netflix  announces Cher's funeral.  They've got the exclusive right.  I don't see  how this serves the end of celebrating a life and bringing people together.   We're using great lives to divide Americans, and that's not --  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Some mean person on Facebook said something like, Aretha  Franklin's memorial service was so great that it's been picked up for ten  episodes on Netflix.  I almost fell over.  But, OK, I guess it was on for  four or five hours.  But, my goodness, it was star-studded and it did get  political.  </p><p>ARROYO:  Six hours.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Six hours, that's all.  OK.  And Raymond, thanks so much.</p><p>And as the NFL season prepares to kick off, there's new data on just how  many Americans side with President Trump over the National Anthem protest.   Why it should send chills through the league, next.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I know you well.  You love  our country.  You're proud of our history.  And you always respect our  great American flag.  </p><p>We are standing up for the heroes who protect America.  We are proudly  standing up for our National Anthem.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST:  Well, that was President Trump in  Evansville, Indiana, last night.  And when the NFL season is ready to kick  off, the National Anthem protests are yet again taking center field, pun  intended.  The league has plenty of reason to be concerned.  A new \"Wall  Street Journal\"/NBC News poll finds that 54 percent of voters think that  kneeling during the anthem is not appropriate.  And that's compared to 43  percent who say it's a fair way to protest racial inequality.  </p><p>Joining me now with their reactions, Kevin Jackson is an author and a FOX  News contributor, and Antjuan Seawright is a Democratic strategist.   Gentlemen, it's great to see you tonight.  Antjuan, let's start with you.   The numbers aren't hugely disparate there, a majority saying the National  Anthem, kneeling is not appropriate.  But there's a sizable number of  people saying it's fine, it doesn't really bother them.  It's not clear  that this is probably good, ultimately, for NFL viewership, though,  Antjuan.  I'm ready to go to the Notre Dame game tomorrow night.  And  college football is where it's at.  I'm sorry.  NFL football, I just know a  lot of people who are just not all that jazzed on it.  And I think this is  part of the reason.  Even if it's not intended to be disrespectful to the  military, a lot of military veterans do feel that way.  And I think that  ends up hurting the whole experience for just a lot of folks.  </p><p>ANTJUAN SEAWRIGHT, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Well, Laura, a couple things.  I  think sometimes what gets lost in the conversation is why this even  started.  This started because Kaepernick felt like black and brown people  were mistreated at the hands of law enforcement.  That's number one.  </p><p>Number two, when you look at polls, and I'll take this scenario or any  other scenario where people are being surveyed, it's all about how the  question is asked, who is doing the asking, and how the question is being  framed.  But if you look at the NFL and you look at the bottom line, their  revenue numbers, their revenue increased by five percent last year, not to  mention the $50 million Amazon deal for streaming that was signed.  </p><p>And so while these people may say they may not agree with the protests, I  tend to believe that they still will watch the NFL.  And football, like any  other sport, is one of the very few things that most people, Democrats,  Republicans, black or white, rich or poor, agree on.  I just hate it's  turned into a political football, no pun intended.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, well, Kevin, I don't think anyone is trying to make it  political.  I think people -- </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Well, the president is, Laura.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Well, I think the president is standing up for what he believes  in, which is just like the folks who are kneeling.  They're kneeling for  what they believe in, and the president is standing up for what he believes  in.  You can't have it one way and say this whole side gets to do this when  the president can't talk about what he believes.  Kevin, your thoughts on  this?  </p><p>KEVIN JACKSON:  As Jerry Glanville said one time, NFL is going to stand for  \"Not For Long.\"  He can quote all the numbers and statics he wants.  The  NFL is in triage.  And I don't know why they're on this self-defeating  path, but they like being on it.  And it reminds me of what the Democrats  are doing in going against Donald Trump in many ways.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Here we go.  </p><p>JACKSON:  At the end of the day -- yes, here we go.  You're exactly right.   Here we go.  When you look at what's going on with what Donald Trump is  standing up, the flag, he's standing up for veterans.  By the way, he's  also standing up for police.  I've got a film coming out called \"Bleeding  Blue,\" and one of police in there says, hey, when something happens in your  neighborhood, are you going to call a cop or are you going to call Colin  Kaepernick?  And he's exactly right.  The police are going to have to do  their jobs, and Colin Kaepernick, whether he likes it or not, he started a  trend.  And, Laura, I don't know what the statistics are, but I'll tell  you, the overwhelming number of Americans believe in the flag, believe in  the Anthem, believe in standing for it, and believe in the military, and  believe in the police.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  You can take a knee in protest but also stand up for believing  in America and everything she stands for.  </p><p>JACKSON:  Take a knee for the people killed in Chicago. </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Again, I'll say, you can focus on why this even started, the  fact that African-American, black and brown people are five times more  likely to be mishandled or killed at the hands of law enforcement.  This is  why that started.  And so while you can see these people are not pro- America, look, my father served in the military.  My father served so that  these players would have the right to take their knee.  </p><p>JACKSON:  More black people are killed by other black people than cops.   And you can argue this as much as you want.  Randy Moss wore a tie to get  inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame and it had 12 black people's names on it  that expanded over a decade.  This idea that cops are out hunting and  killing black people is ridiculous.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  No one ever said they were out hunting and killing black  people.  I said they were mishandled at the hands of law enforcement.   Statistics will prove that to be true.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  We've got to move on.  We've got other topics we want to hit  while I have you both here.  So I want to get your reaction to this.  Last  night CNN's Don Lemon took a pretty nasty shot at Kanye West over Kanye's  support for President Trump.  Watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  It's like a word salad where you realize that Kanye  West, entitled to his own opinion, but is not very bright and not very --  when it comes -- I'm talking about this position, not overall, but when it  comes to these issues, he's not clued in.  He needs to read about it before  he speaks about it.  I'm not saying he's not a bright person.  I take that  back.  That's not what I meant.  But when it comes to this particular  issue, he needs to look at a book, read some history, and understand what  he's talking about.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's pretty condescending coming from Don Lemon, who himself  has had a few wobbly moments.  Let's watch.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I love you, too, but we really don't need to see  what's about to happen here.  I love you, Don.  No, keep it closed.  OK,  I'm cutting you off after this one.  Should I cut him off?  </p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR:  A lot of people have been asking about that, about  black holes and on and on and on, and all of these conspiracy theories.   Let's look at this.  Noah says, \"What else can you think about?  Black  hole?  Bermuda Triangle.\"  And then Deji says \"Just like the movie \"Lost?\"  And of course it's also referencing \"The Twilight Zone,\" which has a very  similar plot.  That's what people are saying.  I know it's preposterous.   But is it preposterous?  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  He was talking in that last sound bite about the Malaysian jet  that disappeared, crashed, but could have been pulled up by a black hole.   I mean, I guess.  I'm being charitable tonight.  I guess.  </p><p>JACKSON:  You don't have to have Don Lemon being drunk to showcase his  lunacy.  Just watch his program any night.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Because you don't agree with him.  </p><p>JACKSON:  No.  I don't agree with you, but you're sitting here and I'm not  interrupting you.  Look, at the end of the day, when you look at what he  said about Kanye West, he's trying to correct a grown man who dare have an  opinion that differs from his.  And, oh, by the way, Donald Lemon, Kanye  happens to be right.  There are many reasons for us to be looking at Donald  Trump through the prism, it certainly is black folks, to be looking to  Donald Trump as a person who's done a lot more for blacks than Barack  Obama.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Oh, Jesus Christ, man. </p><p>JACKSON:  And people don't want to admit this.  And for Don Lemon and this  particular gentleman to keep talking about Donald Trump as if he's some bad  guy, or Kanye West who is bringing out what we're calling the Kanye effect  is ridiculous.  More black people are waking up because of Kanye West and  his comments, because they're tired of being demonized, because --</p><p>INGRAHAM:  All right, let's go to Antjuan.  Antjuan?</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Laura, that sounds all good.  What Don Lemon did -- he  corrected his statement.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Antjuan, Antjuan.</p><p>JACKSON:  I know, but I'm going to interrupt him like he did me, Laura.  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  What Don Lemon corrected was Kaney's position, and Kanye even  apologized and walked it back, his comment about enslavement a couple of  days ago on a national radio show because he was actually wrong.  And I  appreciate him taking his comments back.</p><p>JACKSON:  He wasn't wrong.</p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Look, I am not for criticizing someone for having an opinion  because we all have one.  </p><p>JACKSON:  Yes, you are.</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, why not?  </p><p>SEAWRIGHT:  Make sure when you speak of a certain instance, make sure that  the facts are very, very clear.  And I'm glad that Kanye West was able to  be man enough to walk back his comments.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, we've got to roll.  All right, we've got to roll, guys.   Thanks so much for joining us tonight.  </p><p>I have a question, though.  Is President Trump about to prove his naysayers  wrong and score a huge victory for America?  Well, how about in trade?   Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Canada feeling the heat from President Trump over a new trade  deal.  Tensions spilled out in the public view throughout the day under a  looming deadline.  Take a listen to Canada's minister of foreign affairs.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRYSTIA FREELAND, CANADIAN MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS:  We are committed  to speaking for Canada to a deal which is a good deal for Canada, not just  any deal.  We are very good as Canadians at finding win-win compromises.   At the end of the day, though, we are only going to sign a deal that's good  for Canada.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  Now, a final agreement was not yet inked, reached today.  But  talks are set to resume next Wednesday.  And my sources are telling me  they're very close.  </p><p>Joining us now to analyze is Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy, along with  Democratic strategist Roger Risk.  Great to see you both.  Roger, let's  start with you.  This issue of trade is something I've been writing about  for, I don't know, about 20 years.  And Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner, Luis  Videgaray who was on our show exclusively on Monday night, and Freeland  were all behind closed doors today.  They're hammering this out.  It's very  complicated.  The agricultural subsidies that Canada gives, especially to  its dairy farmers, are incredibly important to Quebec.  And that's a  sticking point.  But my sources are telling me they're extremely close.   And no one wants Canada to walk away from the table.  Canada doesn't and  obviously the administration doesn't.  Your reaction tonight?  </p><p>ROGER FISK, FORMER OBAMA ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL:  I think it's almost the  tale of two trade talks.  I find some encouraging elements to how the  administration has conducted itself with the Mexican set of the trade  talks.  That's been more sober, more process-driven.  They've been working  on it for a year.  I hope that the success of that as we move forward  starts to guide how the president views the resources around him, starts to  maybe trust in some of the professionals that are there to help him.  </p><p>The Canadian discussion is obviously much more accelerated and I think is  going to take more time maybe than what we think right now.  And then  there's other factors that are going to make this more difficult as we go  ahead.  We have the 90-day window with Congress.  If you look at the letter  that the Senate majority leader sent to the president with 35 of his  colleagues, I think there's every indication that Congress wants to get  into the details of this.  And then you're going to have a change of  administrations in Mexico.  </p><p>Overall, I think we are actually closer to the starting line than we are to  the finish line.  I wouldn't want the administration to start spiking the  football.  There's more work to do, but this is actually encouraging.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Yes, I mean, Sean, Congressman Duffy, this is something that the  left, never Trump, they were all against it.  Chamber of Commerce never  wanted this.  They said it was never going to happen.  It is going to  happen.  I will count my chickens.  It is going to happen and it's probably  going to happen next week.  And no one thought Trump could do it.  No one  thought Trump could do it.  Your reaction tonight.  </p><p>REP. SEAN DUFFY, (R) WISCONSIN:  They had no faith in a great negotiator,  Donald Trump.  Let's be clear what's happening, Laura.  When Donald Trump  engaged Mexico, they recognized that there was some unfair practices  between the two countries.  They sat down and they worked them out with us,  and it's a winner for both of us, but it's a winner for the American  worker.  From all my contacts inside the administration, the Canadians,  they've been really hard to deal with.  They're using America as a piggy  bank, as Donald Trump will say, and they want to keep that piggy bank alive  and well, sucking cash and jobs out of our country.  </p><p>And Donald Trump, thank God he's standing up for the Wisconsin dairy.  We  want to sell our products all over the world.  We can't sell them into  Canada.  They put a 200 to 300 percent tariff on our products.  Laura, what  happens if we said, OK, you put a 300 percent tariff on our milk.  We'll  put a 300 percent tariff on your autos that you're producing and trying to  sell here.  See how that goes over in Canada.  Unfair.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Roger, what happened in this NAFTA set of talks is Canada was  involved for almost the entire last year except for the last two months,  because then they thought, oh, they're never going to agree, Mexico and the  United States.  Then we'll stand with Mexico against the United States and  we'll get more out of it.  Lo and behold, Mexico struck a deal with the  United States and Canada was odd man out.  </p><p>So Freeland flies in at the last minute and says, OK, maybe we can work  something out.  But that was a brilliant move.  I think they underestimated  the strength of the relationship forged by Bob Lighthizer, Jared Kushner,  the entire U.S. TR team.  These guys have been working around the clock,  literally around the clock over the last 10 days.  And I don't think people  fully understood the strength of this new relationship with Mexico,  presidential tweets notwithstanding.  </p><p>FISK:  Well, I think it's a great indication that the president should be  able to rely on some of the experts he has.  And I hope he starts to do  that in some of the other challenges that he has on his plate.  The issues  with Mexico, some of the progress that was made with the auto parts and  where the assembly points are located and things like that I think are  great.  I think you have to agree, there's still more work to be done.   This is not the end of the whole process.</p><p>DUFFY:  The left wants us to look to the globalists that were there before  for their expertise.  Donald Trump has a great gut himself, but we want  those who are going to negotiation for America, for American dairy, for  American manufacturers.  </p><p>INGRAHAM:  Guys, thank you so much.  We're out of time, but fantastic  conversation.  We're going to be right back.    </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>INGRAHAM:  That's all the time we have tonight.  I want to give a big  thanks to a team out here in our Chicago bureau who helped get together the  show over the last few days.  It was a Herculean effort.  And don't forget  to tweet me @IngrahamAngle.  Have a wonderful Labor Day weekend, and be  sure to watch a special addition of THE INGRAHAM ANGLE on Labor Day.  It's  the best of \"Seen and Unseen\" with my partner in crime, Raymond Arroyo.  </p><p>And until then, have a wonderful weekend, fly your flag, hang out with your  family and friends.  Up next, Shannon Bream.  Goodnight form Chicago.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2018 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

I'm Jake Tapper.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are live at Jackson State University, a historically black university founded in 1877 for the first major Democratic 2020 event in the state of Mississippi.  We're here with Senator Warren, a former special needs teacher and law professor who made her name fighting the big banks.  If elected, she would make history as the first female president of the United States of America.  </p><p>Tonight, Senator Warren will take questions from Democrats and independents who say they plan to participate in the Democratic primaries and caucuses.  Please welcome Senator Elizabeth Warren.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Hey, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER:  How are you?  Good to see you.  </p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Have a seat.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, this is fun.  </p><p>TAPPER:  So before we begin, you're a former law professor.  Feel good to be back on a campus?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, it always feels good to be back on a campus.  Absolutely.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Which is more fun, teaching law students, teaching on a campus, or working with senators in the U.S. Senate?  </p><p>WARREN:  Oh, teaching.  Are you kidding?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Much more fun.  </p><p>TAPPER:  I thought you might give that answer.  </p><p>WARREN:  That's right.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let's start with our first town hall question.  The first one comes from Christopher Lane.  He's a doctoral candidate in public health here at Jackson State University.  Christopher?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator Warren.  My question is, Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states in the country, yet many white poor and working-class citizens continue to vote against their economic interests.  What message, if any, do you have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to vote for you?  </p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you for the question, Christopher.  Look, this is how I see it.  Washington is working great, it's working fabulously for giant drug companies.  It's just not working for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for big oil companies that want to drill everywhere.  It's just not working for people who see climate change bearing down upon us.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for giant financial institutions and for payday lenders.  It's just not working great for people who are living paycheck to paycheck.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich and the powerful.  I want a Washington that works for the rest of America.  That's why I'm in this fight.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I believe on that, that Democrats, independents, and Republicans, they know a scam when they see it.  And they see a Washington working for those guys.  I think they're ready to get in the fight and get a Washington and a country that works for the rest of America.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  So our next -- our next questioner is Khalita Hicks.  She's a supporter of yours and a Spanish language translator from Jackson.  Khalita?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Khalita.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening.  Since the election of Donald Trump, the number of hate crimes has increased and white supremacists have become more emboldened online and in public.  What are your plans to unite the country?  </p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good.  Thank you for that question.  You know, it starts with the fact that we've got to recognize the threat posed by white nationalism.  White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist group, like ISIS, like Al Qaida.</p><p>And leadership starts at the top.  And that means you've got to call it out.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No sitting by.  And then when you call it out, as president of the United States, you've got to use the tools available to you.  And that means get the Justice Department when they break the law to go after them with full prosecution.  That's what I can do.  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.  Good question.</p><p>TAPPER:  Our next question comes from Georgia Cohran.  She's a graduate student here at Jackson State University.  Georgia?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you, Senator Warren, for taking my question.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Got to hold the mike up there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you so much for taking my question.  I am an African-American female with -- I'm an African-American female with five beautiful adult children and 10 grandchildren.  </p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Georgia, count your blessings every day.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION:  Please, please, describe to me what a public apology to -- for 400 years of free labor...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... in the South, especially Mississippi, will look like in the African American community in the new election.  </p><p>WARREN:  All right, thank you, Georgia.  </p><p>QUESTION:  In the new administration.  </p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom, and on the backs of slave labor.  This is a stain on America, and we're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until we address it head on, directly.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And make no mistake:  It's not just the original founding.  It's what's happened generation after generation.  The impact of discrimination handed down from one to the next means that today in America, because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination, we live in a world where for the average white family has $100, the average black family has about $5.  </p><p>So I believe it's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what's right and begin to heal.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, if I could just follow up on -- if I could just follow up on Georgia's question, you've said you're open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and also to Native Americans, you also said.  Might that include direct payments, direct financial transfer of money?  </p><p>WARREN:  So there are a lot of ways to think about how reparations should be formed.  And I noticed, Georgia's question actually started with just the frame of an apology, right, with the frame of a national recognition.  </p><p>We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists who have a whole lot of different approaches to it.  And I think the best we can do right now -- I love the idea of this congressional commission.  Let's bring people together and let's open that conversation as Americans.  Let's see what ideas people want to put on the table, and let's talk them through, because I got to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Jay Kucia.  He's a supporter of yours, as well.  He's a student who founded a labor rights group at the University of Mississippi Law School.  That's in Oxford, I believe.</p><p>WARREN:  Right.</p><p>TAPPER:  He has a question about Medicare for all.  Jay?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>QUESTION:  Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here this evening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care.  As a supporter of universal health care and an advocate for organized labor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of private health insurance... </p><p>WARREN:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... that would eliminate the private health employer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for.  Can you explain how Medicare for all would be better for workers than simply improving the Affordable Care Act?  </p><p>WARREN:  OK, so it's a good question.  Let's start with our statement that we should make every time we start to talk about changes in our health care, and that is health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate that your question starts with the Affordable Care Act.  Let's all remember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start where we are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.   </p><p>Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expand health care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody is covered.  Republicans right this minute are out there trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  They've got a lawsuit pending down in Texas where they're trying to roll it back.  What they couldn't do with a vote, they're trying to do with the courts.  HHS every day is doing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.  </p><p>So when we're talking about health care in America right now, the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the Affordable Care Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Then part two.  Let's make the improvements that are what I think of as low-hanging fruit.  For example, let's bring down the cost of prescription drugs all across this country.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We got lots of ways we can do that.  We can import drugs from Canada where the safety standards are the same.  That would cut costs dramatically.  We can negotiate the prices under Medicare.  That would cut costs dramatically.  </p><p>And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on generic drugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions.  So let's get those costs down.  </p><p>And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumer advocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companies accountable.  And that means no tricking and trapping people on those insurance contracts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lot of different pathways.  What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure everybody gets covered.  And some folks are talking about let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55, 50.  That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful, for example, to the labor's plans.</p><p>Some people say, do it the other way.  Let's bring it up from -- everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare.  Others say let employees be able to buy into the Medicare plans.  Others say let's let employees buy into the Medicare plans.</p><p>For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this, that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on their own, everybody comes to the table together.  And we figure out how to do Medicare for all in a way that makes sure that we're going to get 100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost for everyone.  That's our job.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You like that?</p><p>TAPPER:  If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question, so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all bill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths to universal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored would essentially eliminate private insurance.  Is that something you could support?</p><p>WARREN:  He's got a runway for that.  I think we get everybody together.  And that's what it is, we'll decide.  I've also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use.  But what's really important to me about this is we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center is about making sure that every single person in this country gets the coverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford.  We start with our values, we'll get to the right place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, theoretically, though, there could be a role for private insurance companies under President Warren?</p><p>WARREN:  There could.  Or there could be a temporary role.  Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's -- look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm.  Everybody has got to stay covered.  It's critical.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Kari Johnson.  She's a high school principal in Canton, Mississippi.  Kari?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kari.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello, Senator Warren, and thank you for coming.  </p><p>WARREN:  I'm glad to be here.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Obviously, building a wall will not prevent foreigners from crossing on U.S. land.  </p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  What will you do -- what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants?</p><p>WARREN:  OK.  So let me just start where I think of our whole immigration policy, and that is, we need to have policies on immigration that are consistent with our values.  </p><p>We are a country that is built on our differences.  That is our strength, not our weakness.  And when people come to the United States because they are fleeing terror in Central America, they fear for their lives, then we have a moral responsibility to listen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... and to be there.  You know, if I can just take a minute to say on this one, I went down to the border last year when the word first began to come out about children taken away from their mothers.  And I just want you all to envision this.  </p><p>Think of a big, old Amazon warehouse, only dirty and smelled bad.  And when I walked in on my left were cages, maybe 10 feet wide, 40 feet deep, a toilet back in the corner, one after another after another crammed full of men.  On the right, one after another after another crammed full of women.  And then you walk into the main area, and there were cages about the size of this central area here with nothing but little girls in it.  And over there, nothing but little boys.  </p><p>That's not who we are.  That is not the country we want to be.  And an immigration system that is administered so that it is not able to tell the difference between a criminal, a terrorist, and a 12-year-old little girl is an immigration system that not only is not keeping us safer, it does not reflect our values.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I will not support the building of a wall that does not make us safer.  The administration itself, people within it, have already said this is not about security, this is not how we're going to make ourselves safer.  The kind of wall that is proposed now is a monument to hate and division.  We are a better country than that.  So, I'll just stop there.  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, Senator, just to follow up, so Kari's specific question was what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants.  </p><p>WARREN:  So -- I should hit both of those.  You're exactly right.  One thing we can do is remember all the tools in the toolbox.  And that is, when there's a problem in Central America, because the gangs have taken over, because the local officials can't manage, then that's not a point at which we should be cutting our aid.  </p><p>If we want to stop the problem of mamas fleeing for their lives, then let's make a little more investment in the areas that are troubled.  And let's help people be able to stay where they are safely.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's a much kinder way to do it.  </p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Paul Buckley.  He's a high school history teacher from Jackson.  Paul?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, how are you, Paul?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Doing well.  Good evening.  Welcome to Mississippi.  </p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUESTION:  So, Senator, conservatives are increasingly using the socialist label as a means of attack.  So how and to what degree with your policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance, offering financially challenged Americans a hand up, but not a handout?</p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, this one really -- this is just a reminder that folks can say whatever they want, but the reality is, at least for me, I believe in markets and I believe in the value that we get out of markets.  But it's got to be markets with rules.  You know, market without rules is theft.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But a market with rules, a market with rules, a market with a cop on the beat to enforce those rules, that's how it is that small businesses get a chance to start and to grow.  That's how it is that employees get to move from one place to another.  That's how it is that we get new products.  I'm a supporter of markets with rules.  </p><p>And what's wrong right now in Washington is the big folks, they don't want rules.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>These giant corporations, they just want to be able to run over whoever they want to run over.  And if that means run over their own employees, then, by golly, they'll do it.  If that means run over their customers, by golly, they'll do it.  If that means running over their local communities, by golly, they will do it.  </p><p>So the way I see this is we not only need a government that's on our side with these rules.  We need big, systemic change.  And that means we need more balance out there in the marketplace.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you, real quick, a couple of ways we can do that.  The first one is, we need for employees to have more power, and that means we need to make it easier to join a union and unions need to have more power once people have joined.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Unions built America's middle class.  Unions will rebuild America's middle class.  That's how we make it happen.  Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  And we should note, you're here in Mississippi, you're focusing on housing for people who are struggling.  You have a plan to try to tackle that.  You say it's going to help lower rent.  How does that work?  </p><p>does that work?  </p><p>WARREN:  So I have a proposal to build about 3 million new housing units across America.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I just want to stop for a second.  Anybody in here worry about the rise price of housing?  Right?  Yeah, that's pretty much everybody, right?  </p><p>The idea is that we need to make a real investment in housing.  In the same way that we think about health care as a basic human right, having a decent and safe place to live should be a basic human right.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And the squeeze is everywhere.  It's the poor, it's the working poor, it's the working class, it's the middle class, shoot, it even kind of moves up into the upper middle class, that people feel squeezed on housing, because we just don't have enough affordable housing across this country.  </p><p>So I believe what we should do is we should make a big investment in housing.  And by the way, if we do that, independent analysis from Moody's says that we would lower rents across this country by about 10 percent -- that's across the board -- and we'd create an opportunity for more people to become buyers.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So housing is important.  And if I can, Jake, I want to tell you about one other part of this.  This bill also addresses the black-white gap in housing that comes from generation after generation, not just a passive discrimination, but realize that into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families.  That's red-lining.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>This bill tackles that head on.  And it says for people who are living in formally red-lined areas, there's going to be special assistance for first-time homebuyers, for people who got cheated in the run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, some special assistance for folks to be able to get that first home and to start building the generation after generation of wealth.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's a step in the right direction.  </p><p>TAPPER:  We're going to take a very quick break.  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We're live in Jackson, Mississippi.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We are live on the campus of Jackson State University.  </p><p>We're going to go to the questioners in a second, but before we do, I do want to ask a little bit about your personal story, because voters nationwide are just getting to know you.  You grew up in Oklahoma.  </p><p>WARREN:  I did.  </p><p>TAPPER:  And you've talked about how your family stood at the brink...</p><p>WARREN:  There's one.</p><p>TAPPER:  One person from Oklahoma.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>WARREN:  There we go.</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome to Mississippi.  So you talked about how your family stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good part of your childhood.  How has that shaped your life in the Senate?  </p><p>WARREN:  So, I'll tell you about that.  So I have three older brothers.  They all went off and joined the military.  That was their ticket to America's middle class.  </p><p>I was the late-in-life baby.  My mother always just called me \"the surprise.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heart attack, and it was serious.  Thought he was going to die.  The church neighbors brought covered dishes.  It was a scary time.  </p><p>He survived, but he couldn't go back to work.  And we lost our family's station wagon.  And at night, I'd hear my parents talk, and that's where I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" And I remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and laying out on the bed is the dress.  </p><p>And some people here will know the dress.  It's the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations.  And my mother is in her slip, and she's stocking feet, and she's pacing back and forth, and she's crying.  She's saying, \"We will not lose this house.  We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old.  She had never worked outside the home.  She was truly terrified.  </p><p>And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job.  And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.  </p><p>Anybody who wants to know me has just heard this story.  But here's the thing for me now.  For a long time, I used to think that was just a story about my mother, how when you get scared, you reach down and you find what you have to find and you bring it up.  </p><p>And then, years later, I came to understand this is a story about millions of Americans, who -- it doesn't matter if you're scared.  When you got to do something to take care of people you love, you reach down, you find it, and you pull it up.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then it was years later that I came to understand it was also a story about government, because when this happened to my family, the minimum wage in America would support a family of three.  It would take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on the table.  </p><p>Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty.  I am in this fight...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... because I believe that is wrong.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, it's -- for me, there's the whole story of why I'm in this fight.  Washington once asked the question, at least on minimum wage, what does it take to support a family, to get a little toe in the door?  Today, I hear them in Washington.  They ask, what will improve the profitability of giant multinational banks?  </p><p>Well, I want a government that doesn't work for giant multinational corporations.  I want one that works for little families like mine.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Latoya Hubbard.  She works for a defense contracting firm here in Mississippi.  Latoya?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening.  </p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Latoya.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Do you have any plans of relieving federally funded, overwhelming student loan debt burdens, in that many middle-class and poor individuals obtained those loans to create a better future, but are having issues doing that?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Latoya, the answer is yes.  I have got plans to reduce student loan debt.  Let me just start there.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, there are parts of this that are so personal.  I've had one dream since I was in second grade.  There's just one thing I wanted to be.  All three of my brothers went off and joined the military, and God bless them.  Do you know what I wanted to be?  I wanted to be a public schoolteacher from the time I was in second grade.  Can we hear it for America's public schoolteachers?  Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But you've got to have a four-year diploma to do that.  And by the time I graduated high school, my family didn't have the money for a college application, much less to send me off to school.  And I have a long and twisty story, got a scholarship, then I fell in love...</p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>... got married, the first time.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And I thought I'd lost it all.  I thought I was -- I thought I had given up on that dream.  And I found a commuter college, public college, that cost $50 a semester.  And that was my ticket.  And I became a special needs teacher.  I got to live my dream.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So let me just say, I believe in what we can do through education.  But if America wants to be a stronger country, America wants to be a country of real opportunity for everyone, then that means that every kid has a right to get an education without getting crushed by student loan debt, period.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  While we're on the subject -- while we're on the subject of education, our next question has to do with the place we're standing in right now, a historically black university.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Kathy Johnson.  She works in banking in Ridgeland, Mississippi.  Kathy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kathy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren.  Being a graduate of a historically black college and university, I see firsthand how we are the first to lose funding or to have budget cuts.  </p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  How would you make it a priority that we receive more funding and being able to compete with non-historically black colleges and universities?  </p><p>WARREN:  All right.  So, great question.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I believe in HBCUs.  I just want to say, I am the proud recipient of a diploma that was granted to me at Morgan State University, so...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>As part of their commencement address.  So, let me put it this way.  What we've got to do is we've got to be willing to invest more in our colleges and universities across the board.  We have got to bring down the cost of an education.  </p><p>of an education.  </p><p>And for the schools that are serving the students who often come from -- first time to come to college, from families that struggle more, then that means we've got to double down and double down a second time to make sure they have the resources they need.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's not enough just for somebody to stand here and talk about it generally.  I want you to know, I get this one.  Right now, in America, African American students are more likely to have to borrow money to go to college.  They're more likely to borrow more money.  And they are more likely to have trouble paying off that debt when they leave college.  That is a national disgrace.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And part of dealing with our student loan debt burden needs to focus on that specifically.  So, thank you.  It's a good question.  Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Brennan Breeland.  He's a lawyer and an officer in the Army Reserves.  Brennan?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator.  </p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Brennan.</p><p>QUESTION:  How do you respond to people who think that, regardless of the underlying facts, the way you handled the question of your Native American heritage was tone-deaf, offensive, and indicative of a lack of presidential tact?  </p><p>WARREN:  Well, you know, I grew up in Oklahoma.  I learned about my family from my family.  And based on that, that's just kind of who I am.  And I do the best I can with it.  </p><p>You know, there was an investigation.  Nothing I ever did or my family played any role in any job I ever got.  </p><p>But I'll tell you this.  I have now done 38 town halls in Massachusetts last year, and this is my 32nd town hall since January.  And what I've discovered is that people care a lot about what's happening to their lives every single day and what touches them, like housing and education and health care.  That's the kind of reason that I'm in this fight.  And I'm going to stay in this fight.  </p><p>And I'll tell you this.  I'm going to fight it from the heart every inch of the way.  I'll do my best.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rukia Lumumba.  She's a legal advocate and community organizer here in Jackson.  She also happens to be the sister and former campaign manager of Jackson's current mayor.  Chokwe Antar Lumumba, her late father, Chokwe Lumumba, was also once the mayor of this city, as well.  Rukia?</p><p>QUESTION:  All right.  Thank you.  </p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Thank you for being here.  Welcome to Jackson, Mississippi.  Yeah.  So voter disenfranchisement is real.  In Mississippi, there are 23 felonies that once convicted ban a person from voting for the rest of their lives, literally limiting their citizenship and right to democracy.  Moreover, residents' access to voting is limited by archaic voter registration processes and limited voting formats.  How will you expand voting rights to the formerly incarcerated, ensure online voter registration, and non-excuse early voting?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great question.  But can I go you one bigger?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</p><p>WARREN:  And that is, I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure that vote gets counted.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to put some federal muscle behind that.  And we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there right now.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you one more.  We need to make sure that every vote counts.  And, you know, I want to -- I want to push that right here in Mississippi, because I think this is an important point.  You know, come a general election, presidential candidates don't come to places like Mississippi.  </p><p>QUESTION:  That's right.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.  They also don't come to places like California and Massachusetts, right?  Because we're not the \"battleground states.\" Well, my view is that every vote matters.  And the way we can make that happen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... is that we can have national voting.  And that means get rid of the Electoral College and everybody counts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Everybody.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to...</p><p>WARREN:  I think everybody ought to have to come and ask for your vote.  What do you think?  Yeah.  </p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Hannah Burnell Williams from here in Jackson.  She's hoping to go to graduate school.  Hannah?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Senator Warren.  </p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Hannah.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Recently, many leaders in our nation have taken a stance on whether or not Confederate symbols should remain in the public eye in many of our cities, towns, and parks.  As a presidential hopeful, do you have any plans on addressing the removal or lack thereof, of the reminders of this nation's dark past or have any plans on preserving the nation's history in a way that explains it in a more educational sense versus showing praise to the losing side?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  All right.  You put it right.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, I would support removing Confederate celebrations from federal lands and putting them in museums where they belong.  That's right.  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me follow up, if I can, because Mississippi is the only state in the country that still has the Confederate battle emblem on the state flag.  Do you think Mississippi should adopt a new flag?  </p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  That was the shortest answer I've ever gotten from a politician in my life.  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We're living in Jackson, Mississippi.  Stay with us.</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall.  We're here with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We're live in Jackson State University in Mississippi.  </p><p>In 2018, Jackson, Mississippi, had it highest homicide rate in more than 20 years, with 84 murders.  According to local media, it's among the highest murder rates in the country.  On that topic, I want to bring in Arreone Hill.  She's an accountant for the office of the state treasurer.  Arreone?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi.  With Jackson, Mississippi, having a very high homicide rate, will there be any revisions to gun control to help ensure less killings throughout the metropolitan city?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So here's how I look at this.  Laws should reflect our values.  Laws are about our morals.  And right now, across this country, we lose on average seven children and teenagers every single day to gun violence.  Just pause for a minute and think, if we were losing seven children every single day to some mysterious virus, man, we'd be pulling out all the stops to say what can we do to change that, where's the medicine we need to develop, how can we respond, what do we need to do?  </p><p>But instead, with gun violence, right now we don't do anything, not even the most sensible kinds of things, background checks...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... at the federal level.  No fly, no buy.  Like if you're on the terrorist watch list, maybe you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That weapons of war do not belong on our streets.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No bump stocks to make it easier to kill.  No.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>There's so much that we could do to improve safety for our children and for all of us, things that people agree with who are gun-owners and things that people agree with who are not gun-owners.  And we have to do them at a federal level, because the problem is, even if you change your laws right here in Mississippi, if they don't change their laws in the other states, if they still have the gun show loopholes, somebody can just go there, put it in the back of a pickup, and come on down.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So this is a national problem.  It goes back to the question I've been talking about, who does government work for?  Right now, it works for the wealthy and the well-connected, and that means we have a federal government being held hostage by the NRA.  I believe we can fight back and we can change that together.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, let me bring in Samantha Manning.  She works here at Jackson State University as an administrative assistant in the Disabilities Services Department.  Samantha?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Samantha.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Hello.  As a mother of black boys, I am constantly reminded of a judicial system where the scales are often weighed against them, and those that have sworn to protect them, fear them, and are most often ruled justified in excessive actions against other children who look like them.  As president, how would you address the concerns that I and many other parents like me have when it comes to protecting our children and restoring our faith in the judicial system?  </p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you very much.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I start with the principle, the four words carved above the United States Supreme Court, \"Equal justice under law.\" That's what I believe in.</p><p>But I understand today in America we don't have that.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Right.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right.  Race matters, and we need to call it out.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, I'd like to follow some of the very practical efforts that Barack Obama, President Obama, put into place when he had his Justice Department going after the police departments that were violating the rights of young black men and women across this country.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I know there's much to criticize this administration about, but the very fact that the Justice Department under President Obama had worked with police departments around the country -- and they were -- they were not finished, but had worked with, and some had already reached the point of signing consent decrees, of starting new training, of trying to put themselves on a better path.  </p><p>There are many good people in law enforcement who want this to work and want to make it work if they have the right resources, if they have the right opportunities, if they can do community policing.  That's where President Obama was leading us, and this administration pulled that out of the Justice Department, reversed it, and that makes the world a lot more dangerous for everyone.  I would reverse that and go where President Obama went.  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Mary Crump.  She's a retired nurse from Jackson.  Mary?  </p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren, for being here.  How do you plan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes?  </p><p>WARREN:  Whoa! </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, look, we need big structural change in this country.  And that means the kind of -- let's just admit it.  When you've got a government that works for the rich and it's not working nearly as well for anyone else, that's corruption, and we need to call it out plain and simple.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So the first thing we need to do is we need to attack that corruption head on.  I have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate.  Big problem, you got to have a big bill to deal with it.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, it's got a lot of pieces to it, but the main point is to beat back on the influence of money, because that's how they keep getting this government, getting this country to work for them.  So, for example, my bill says we're going to end lobbying as we know it.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Lock the revolving door between Main Street -- between Wall Street and Washington.  </p><p>I'll give you one more.  Everyone who runs for federal office ought to have to put their taxes online, everyone.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, part one, we got to deal with the corruption head on.  But let me give you a part two.  I was talking earlier about we got to rewrite the rules in this economy.  And part of that is putting more power back in the hands of workers.  Unions, that's one way to do it.  I've got an accountable capitalism bill that says, on the big Fortune 500 companies, that we're going to have employees also sit on the board of directors and help make decisions.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But there's one more we've got to talk about, and that is my ultra-millionaires tax.  So the idea is, on the truly great fortunes, $50 million and above, we start charging 2 percent a year on just that $50 millionth and first dollar and on up, 2 percent a year.  </p><p>And by the way, anybody in here a homeowner?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You've been paying wealth taxes for a long time.  They're just called property taxes.  I just want to include the Rembrandt and the diamonds in the property taxes.  So...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I'm going to put a wealth tax in place.  And I just want to talk to you for one minute about how that restructures our whole economy.  We get a 2 percent tax on the 75,000 richest families in this country, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare, universal Pre-K, universal Pre-Pre-K for every child in America, and still have $2 trillion left over.  Let's make it happen.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We're live in Jackson, Mississippi.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.  We are live on the campus of Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.  </p><p>I want to bring in Marcy Croft, she is a lawyer from Madison, Mississippi.  Marcy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Marcy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi.  Hi, Senator.  You have proposed breaking up the big tech companies.  </p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  Is it really possible to increase regulation of private tech companies without stifling innovation?  </p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good question, Marcy.  But here's my point.  If you break them up, you actually need less regulation.  Because here's how this works right now.  Think about the big tech companies -- Amazon, Facebook, Google, right?  </p><p>Here's what they do.  They run a platform, OK, where people come -- let's just stick with Amazon.  That's where you go to check out 63 coffee makers, all of which can be delivered in 24 hours, right?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And think about this, just so you get an idea of how vast they are right now in our economy.  Walmart is about 9 percent of all physical retail sales in America.  Amazon, 49 percent of all online.  So this is a big deal.  If you want to sell online, you're a little guy, you're trying to get your business started, you're an entrepreneur, you've got to be there.  </p><p>So Amazon runs this platform.  You come to the platform.  All sounds great.  But Amazon also is collecting information on every single buyer who visits and on every single seller who's there, and on every single transaction.  And what it does is it has the capacity to look out there and see, you know, Pete's pet pillows, and say, whoa, Pete had a good idea here.  He's making money off this.  So here's what we're going to do.  We're going to take Pete off page one, move him back to page 16, where nobody goes, and then Amazon Pete Pet Pillows is going to step right in front of him.  </p><p>You know, think of it this way like in baseball.  You can be an umpire, run the platform, or you can have a team in the game, run one of the businesses competing with the other businesses.  But you don't get to do both at the same time.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So here's my pitch.  I just want to break those two things apart.  I want you still to be able to go and check out all the coffeemakers you want to check out.  The platform works.  But nobody gets to suck a lot of information off the platform for the purpose of being able to put a bunch of little businesses out of business.  </p><p>We want to have more competition in America, break up those tech giants.  We can make that work.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rodney Smith.  He's a lawn maintenance contractor here in Jackson.  Rodney?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Rodney.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening.  The cities of America have crumbling infrastructure.  How would you combat these issues?  These are problems that everyone knows about but have failed to do anything about these problems.  </p><p>WARREN:  Right.  All right, it's a good question.  So, look, think of infrastructure this way.  I kind of think of it like a farmer plows the fields.  We get out there together through our government, and we build the roads and the bridges, we put up the communications system, we do these things together because you can't start a little business and at the same time try to build the road in front of your house, right?  So you need all these pieces to make it work.  A farmer who does a good job of planting the fields, it means a lot of seeds get to grow and to go forward.  </p><p>Now, what's happened in America is that we've cut back on making those infrastructure investments.  And you all see it every day.  You see it in your lives.  You see it when you see roads that are crumbling, bridges that are dangerous.  Yeah, you're all seeing this, right?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So understand, it's worse than what you see, because America competes all around the world now.  That's just the reality.  And right now, here in America, we are spending about 0.6 percent, just a smidge, on our infrastructure.  In fact, some people say it's not even enough to replace what's breaking and falling apart.  China, by comparison, is spending about 5 percent of its GDP on infrastructure.  It is spending eight times more, almost nine times more on its infrastructure.  </p><p>It's building a future for those small businesses, for those medium-sized businesses, for those giant businesses.  It is building a future for work in China.  We need to step up our investment in infrastructure right here in the United States of America.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's how we build a future.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>And I'll add one little piece to it and say, when you take a look at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building the infrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yes.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Maggie Spitz.  She works at a public library in Madison, Mississippi.  Maggie?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you.  </p><p>WARREN:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  Presently the state of Mississippi imposes a special tax on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles as a penalty for paying less in gas taxes.  Do you believe this is the right approach, considering the warnings about climate change?  And what would you propose to encourage the increased use of alternative energy?  </p><p>WARREN:  OK.  So, can we just start with the issue of climate change?  And I want to say something that is very controversial.  So, most of you are sitting down.  Maggie, is it?  You may want to sit down, too, OK, or just hold on to a chair.  Because I spend time in Washington.  In Washington, this is a very controversial statement:  I believe in science.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Climate change is real, it is manmade, and we are running out of runway to be able to fix this problem.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need all hands on deck on this one.  So I mentioned earlier, as part of infrastructure, we need to be thinking about infrastructure in terms of hardening our infrastructure against the climate change that's coming our way and in terms of building green energy infrastructure.  </p><p>We need to do more, though.  We've got to be working in every single direction.  More money on research.  More money on how we get our vehicles so that we get to a place where we have a sustainable Earth.  This is truly the crisis that faces not just our nation, but the world.  </p><p>The United States is a world leader.  The problem is we are leading in the wrong direction right now on climate.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We've got to go the other way.  We've got to show the world what can be done.  Thank you.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I just want to follow up on Maggie's question, because she talked about the gas tax.  As you know, the federal gas tax has not been raised...</p><p>WARREN:  I know.</p><p>TAPPER:  ... since 1993, leaving many states to fend for themselves to maintain the roads and bridges.  Would you support, theoretically, raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructure needs?  </p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, I'll tell you what worries about doing this through gas tax.  I'm open to the conversation, but what worries me is it falls hardest on working people.  When I talk about raising taxes, what I really want to see is I want to see an ultra-millionaire's tax.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I want to see taxes on the top.  And then let's use that to help subsidize what it is that we really want to see:  Cleaner vehicles.  That's the direction I'd much rather see us go.  I want to get us there, but I want to do it the other way.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Ally Mack, a longtime Jackson resident, who served as the dean of international studies here at Jackson State University.  Dean Mack?  </p><p>QUESTION:  What is your position on the impeachment of Donald Trump?  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So, we have a report that is due from the special prosecutor any day now.  Understand that that investigation from Mr. Mueller has produced already -- I believe it's 34 indictments or guilty pleas.  This is a serious investigation.  We need to protect him in finishing that report.  And then that report needs to be made public to the American people.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>When we get it, we will know what to do with it.  Thank you.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Senator Warren, you sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee.  </p><p>WARREN:  I do.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to introduce you to Daniel Bamrick.  He's a U.S. Army veteran who served in Kuwait and Syria who is now a research lab technician.  Daniel?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Daniel.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Hey, Senator.  Good evening.  </p><p>WARREN:  Hi.  Thank you for your service.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  Your family, too.  Big brothers.</p><p>WARREN:  All right.  Thank you.  </p><p>QUESTION:  As a veteran, I've seen the amazing capability of our armed forces.  </p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.  </p><p>QUESTION:  But I was also shocked to see the lack of clearly defined goals and objectives coming down from the highest level.  It also worries me that military service itself is becoming a very uncommon experience...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.  </p><p>QUESTION:  ... for the U.S. population at large.  So, as president, my question is, what would you do to provide clear, achievable goals for our military and to broaden the participation rate of American citizens in what is their government's largest organization?  </p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  Thank you, Daniel.  Thank you for the question.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.  </p><p>WARREN:  Look, with three brothers in the military, my oldest one spent more than five years off and on in combat in Vietnam.  We were lucky to get him back home.  And my second brother was overseas for over a year.  My third brother trained as an Army medic.  I understand the sacrifices that our military makes and the sacrifices their families make.  I stood there every day and watched my mother as she waited for the mail to hear from my brothers.  </p><p>We have the best military on Earth.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>They will do whatever we ask them to do.  They will go out and fight and, if necessary, die for us.  But that puts a sacred responsibility on our leadership to understand that, around the world, we cannot use our military to solve non-military problems.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to be willing to use all of the tools in the toolbox, and that means we need to be using our diplomatic tools much stronger.  We need to use our economic tools.  And we need, when we do feel absolutely pressed to use a military alternative, we need to be clear not just on what our objective is going in, what the measure is of success, but what our plan is to get out on the other side.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We cannot fight endless wars.  It's wrong.  </p><p>TAPPER:  So, Daniel worked in Syria.  He served in Syria.  You've said it's, quote, \"right to get our troops out of Syria,\" but you did criticize President Trump for failing to plan the withdrawal...</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.  </p><p>TAPPER:  ... with U.S. allies.  The U.S. is currently planning to leave 400 or more servicemembers in Syria on what is being called a peacekeeping mission.  Would you as president keep any troops on the ground in Syria?  And if so, how many?  </p><p>WARREN:  I think we need to get out.  We need to get out.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Until someone can identify -- and this is the whole point about it.  I ask this in hearings in Armed Services.  What is the measure of success?  If you're going to be there, describe, let us see so we can tell if you're failing or succeeding at this.  And no one can come up with an answer.  And until they can do that, we need our troops back home.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Jayda Lee, a public health educator from Jackson.  Jada?</p><p>WARREN:  Hello, hi, Jayda.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Hi.  Good evening.  Mississippi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation.  Black and brown women make up the majority of those who fall victim to higher rates of pregnancy-related mortality.  </p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Although some of this disparity can be attributed to lack of access, other issues are less easily explained.  How would you administration create legislation to improve outcomes for these women?  </p><p>WARREN:  So, it is an excellent question.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let me tell you something I've already been working on in this area.  This is a place where we need not only more funding for the National Institutes of Health to be able to do the research, but we need to insist that the National Institutes of Health is actually doing research and keeping track of male/female, African American/other races, so that we better understand all of what's wrong.  </p><p>As you say, we know that part of this is related to lack of access, but that's not explaining everything that's going on.  I believe in research.  And we've got to support it so that it supports all of our mamas and all of our babies.  It's very important.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I want to bring in Michael Barber.  He's a freshman here at Jackson State University.  He says he's currently supporting Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run.  Michael?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Michael.  </p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, ma'am.  Yeah, my question is we have seen recently kids who have the luxury of parents paying their way into school no matter the GPA.  The kids who attend inner city schools do not have that luxury or the resources to excel and they suffer greatly as they become closer to adult life.  How would you not only improve, but make the educational system fair for all American people?  </p><p>WARREN:  All right.  So, thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, this scandal just shows one more time that some folks who are rich just think they don't have to play by the same set of rules as anyone else and that they can use their money to do whatever it is in terms of buying influence.  We have to put a stop to that.</p><p>And it's not just -- it's everywhere now.  And we're here talking about a presidential primary.  It's everywhere in Washington.  You know, I just -- I want to say something about democracy for a minute.  I get that we have a lot of differences.  There will be some people who have a little more money, some people who have a little less, some people who go further in school, some people who don't.  But the one thing we should all own an equal share of is an equal share of our democracy.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need a government that doesn't just listen to the rich and the powerful, but a government that listens to all of us.  And that starts right now in a Democratic primary.  Something you can ask everyone in the Democratic primary who wants to ask for your vote is to ask them where they've been and how they've gotten their funding.  </p><p>Me, I don't take corporate PAC money.  In fact, I don't take PAC money of any kind.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't take federal lobbyists' money.  And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I don't go behind closed doors with people of money and influence to try to get their help in this election.  I come here to be with you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Because I believe that our democracy is really on the ropes.  We have a country that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top.  In 2020, we have a chance to take that back.  We have a chance to build a real grassroots foundation, face to face, person to person, neighborhood to neighborhood.  </p><p>And if you believe that is how we should be running our presidential primary, I ask you, be part of this.  Go to elizabethwarren.com.  Be part of this.  Make a contribution, volunteer.  We're going to have to build this thing ourselves, because democracy is not a machine that will go of itself.</p><p>And government, our government, is not for sale.  We need a government that works for the people, and that means the people have to be there as part of it.  Thank you.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I have one final question for you, Senator.  Faith is very important to many people across the country.  It's very important to many people in Mississippi.  What role does faith play in your life, your public life and your private life?  </p><p>WARREN:  So I was raised as a Methodist, and...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I was a fifth grade Sunday school teacher.  All I can say is, nobody got hurt.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It was a low bar for being a fifth grade Sunday school teacher at our church.  And I raised my children in the Methodist church.  What it is for me is the importance of the lessons we learn when we remember our values, when we remember our faith.  </p><p>The story for me is Matthew 26, and I'm sure some of you -- a lot of you know this story.  You know, this is the one where the shepherd is dividing the world into the sheep and the goats.  And as we all know, sheep are going to heaven, goats, nah, they're not.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>And the sheep ask him, why us?  Why us, Lord?  Why did you pick us?  We look like those -- like those guys.  And the shepherd, the Lord, answers back by saying, \"I was hungry, and you gave me food.  I was thirsty, and you gave me water.  I was in prison, and you visited me, naked and ye clothed me.  Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.\" </p><p>And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day.  The first is there is God, there is value in every single human being.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every single human being.  And the second is that we are called to action.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That passage is not about you had a good thought and held onto it, you sat back and were just a part of -- you know, thought about good things.  It does not say, you just didn't hurt anybody and that's good enough.  No.  </p><p>It says, you saw something wrong, you saw somebody who was thirsty, you saw somebody who was in prison.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You saw their face.  You saw somebody who was hungry, and it moved you to act.  I believe we are called on to act.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Our thank you to Senator Elizabeth warren.  Thank you, as well, to our audience here and to Jackson State University.  Great questions from all of you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Be sure to tune in Wednesday night at 10 p.m.  Eastern.  Dana Bash will moderate the next CNN Democratic candidate town hall with former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper.  \"CNN Tonight\" starts right now.  </p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDNEW-584142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FEDNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP1-FVW1-JBSW-72XD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9471\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Federal News Service, Inc.

I'm Jake Tapper.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We are live at Jackson State University, a historically black university founded in 1877 for the first major Democratic 2020 event in the state of Mississippi. We're here with Senator Warren, a former special needs teacher and law professor who made her name fighting the big banks. If elected, she would make history as the first female president of the United States of America.   </p><p>      Tonight, Senator Warren will take questions from Democrats and independents who say they plan to participate in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. Please welcome Senator Elizabeth Warren.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hey, Jake.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  How are you? Good to see you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good to see you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Have a seat.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, this is fun.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  So before we begin, you're a former law professor. Feel good to be back on a campus?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, it always feels good to be back on a campus. Absolutely.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Which is more fun, teaching law students, teaching on a campus, or working with senators in the U.S. Senate?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, teaching. Are you kidding?   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      Much more fun.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I thought you might give that answer.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Let's start with our first town hall question. The first one comes from Christopher Lane. He's a doctoral candidate in public health here at Jackson State University. Christopher?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, Senator Warren. My question is, Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states in the country, yet many white poor and working-class citizens continue to vote against their economic interests. What message, if any, do you have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to vote for you?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, thank you for the question, Christopher. Look, this is how I see it. Washington is working great, it's working fabulously for giant drug companies. It's just not working for people who are trying to get a prescription filled.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      It's working great for big oil companies that want to drill everywhere. It's just not working for people who see climate change bearing down upon us.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      It's working great for giant financial institutions and for payday lenders. It's just not working great for people who are living paycheck to paycheck.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich and the powerful. I want a Washington that works for the rest of America. That's why I'm in this fight.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I believe on that, that Democrats, independents, and Republicans, they know a scam when they see it. And they see a Washington working for those guys. I think they're ready to get in the fight and get a Washington and a country that works for the rest of America. Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  So our next -- our next questioner is Khalita Hicks. She's a supporter of yours and a Spanish language translator from Jackson. Khalita?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Khalita.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening. Since the election of Donald Trump, the number of hate crimes has increased and white supremacists have become more emboldened online and in public. What are your plans to unite the country?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, good. Thank you for that question. You know, it starts with the fact that we've got to recognize the threat posed by white nationalism. White supremacists pose a threat to the United States like any other terrorist group, like ISIS, like Al Qaida.  </p><p>      And leadership starts at the top. And that means you've got to call it out.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      No sitting by. And then when you call it out, as president of the United States, you've got to use the tools available to you. And that means get the Justice Department when they break the law to go after them with full prosecution. That's what I can do. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Thank you. Good question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Our next question comes from Georgia Cohran. She's a graduate student here at Jackson State University. Georgia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Georgia.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, thank you, Senator Warren, for taking my question.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Got to hold the mike up there.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you so much for taking my question. I am an African-American female with -- I'm an African-American female with five beautiful adult children and 10 grandchildren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, Georgia, count your blessings every day.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Please, please, describe to me what a public apology to -- for 400 years of free labor...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  ... in the South, especially Mississippi, will look like in the African American community in the new election.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right, thank you, Georgia.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  In the new administration.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So, America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom, and on the backs of slave labor. This is a stain on America, and we're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until we address it head on, directly.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And make no mistake:  It's not just the original founding. It's what's happened generation after generation. The impact of discrimination handed down from one to the next means that today in America, because of housing discrimination, because of employment discrimination, we live in a world where for the average white family has $100, the average black family has about $5.   </p><p>      So I believe it's time to start the national full-blown conversation about reparations in this country.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint a congressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, who talk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make a report back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what's right and begin to heal. Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Senator, if I could just follow up on -- if I could just follow up on Georgia's question, you've said you're open to a conversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and also to Native Americans, you also said. Might that include direct payments, direct financial transfer of money?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So there are a lot of ways to think about how reparations should be formed. And I noticed, Georgia's question actually started with just the frame of an apology, right, with the frame of a national recognition.   </p><p>      We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activists who have a whole lot of different approaches to it. And I think the best we can do right now -- I love the idea of this congressional commission. Let's bring people together and let's open that conversation as Americans. Let's see what ideas people want to put on the table, and let's talk them through, because I got to tell you, ignoring the problem is not working.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Let me bring in Jay Kucia. He's a supporter of yours, as well. He's a student who founded a labor rights group at the University of Mississippi Law School. That's in Oxford, I believe.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  He has a question about Medicare for all. Jay?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here this evening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care. As a supporter of universal health care and an advocate for organized labor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of private health insurance...   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  ... that would eliminate the private health employer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for. Can you explain how Medicare for all would be better for workers than simply improving the Affordable Care Act?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  OK, so it's a good question. Let's start with our statement that we should make every time we start to talk about changes in our health care, and that is health care is a basic human right and we fight for basic human rights.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate that your question starts with the Affordable Care Act. Let's all remember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start where we are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.   </p><p>      Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expand health care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody is covered. Republicans right this minute are out there trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They've got a lawsuit pending down in Texas where they're trying to roll it back. What they couldn't do with a vote, they're trying to do with the courts. HHS every day is doing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.   </p><p>      So when we're talking about health care in America right now, the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the Affordable Care Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Then part two. Let's make the improvements that are what I think of as low-hanging fruit. For example, let's bring down the cost of prescription drugs all across this country.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We got lots of ways we can do that. We can import drugs from Canada where the safety standards are the same. That would cut costs dramatically. We can negotiate the prices under Medicare. That would cut costs dramatically.   </p><p>      And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on generic drugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions. So let's get those costs down.   </p><p>      And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumer advocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companies accountable. And that means no tricking and trapping people on those insurance contracts.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lot of different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest cost way to make sure everybody gets covered. And some folks are talking about let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55, 50. That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful, for example, to the labor's plans.  </p><p>      Some people say, do it the other way. Let's bring it up from -- everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare. Others say let employees be able to buy into the Medicare plans. Others say let's let employees buy into the Medicare plans.  </p><p>      For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this, that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on their own, everybody comes to the table together. And we figure out how to do Medicare for all in a way that makes sure that we're going to get 100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost for everyone. That's our job.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You like that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question, so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for all bill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths to universal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored would essentially eliminate private insurance. Is that something you could support?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  He's got a runway for that. I think we get everybody together. And that's what it is, we'll decide. I've also co-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as another approach that we use. But what's really important to me about this is we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center is about making sure that every single person in this country gets the coverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford. We start with our values, we'll get to the right place.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  So, theoretically, though, there could be a role for private insurance companies under President Warren?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  There could. Or there could be a temporary role. Even Bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's -- look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got to stay covered. It's critical.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Let me bring in Kari Johnson. She's a high school principal in Canton, Mississippi. Kari?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Kari.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hello, Senator Warren, and thank you for coming.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I'm glad to be here.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Obviously, building a wall will not prevent foreigners from crossing on U.S. land.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  What will you do -- what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  OK. So let me just start where I think of our whole immigration policy, and that is, we need to have policies on immigration that are consistent with our values.   </p><p>      We are a country that is built on our differences. That is our strength, not our weakness. And when people come to the United States because they are fleeing terror in Central America, they fear for their lives, then we have a moral responsibility to listen...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      ... and to be there. You know, if I can just take a minute to say on this one, I went down to the border last year when the word first began to come out about children taken away from their mothers. And I just want you all to envision this.   </p><p>      Think of a big, old Amazon warehouse, only dirty and smelled bad. And when I walked in on my left were cages, maybe 10 feet wide, 40 feet deep, a toilet back in the corner, one after another after another crammed full of men. On the right, one after another after another crammed full of women. And then you walk into the main area, and there were cages about the size of this central area here with nothing but little girls in it. And over there, nothing but little boys.   </p><p>      That's not who we are. That is not the country we want to be. And an immigration system that is administered so that it is not able to tell the difference between a criminal, a terrorist, and a 12-year-old little girl is an immigration system that not only is not keeping us safer, it does not reflect our values.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I will not support the building of a wall that does not make us safer. The administration itself, people within it, have already said this is not about security, this is not how we're going to make ourselves safer. The kind of wall that is proposed now is a monument to hate and division. We are a better country than that. So, I'll just stop there. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  So, Senator, just to follow up, so Kari's specific question was what will you put in place to control the influx of migrants.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So -- I should hit both of those. You're exactly right. One thing we can do is remember all the tools in the toolbox. And that is, when there's a problem in Central America, because the gangs have taken over, because the local officials can't manage, then that's not a point at which we should be cutting our aid.   </p><p>      If we want to stop the problem of mamas fleeing for their lives, then let's make a little more investment in the areas that are troubled. And let's help people be able to stay where they are safely.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      That's a much kinder way to do it.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Paul Buckley. He's a high school history teacher from Jackson. Paul?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, how are you, Paul?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Doing well. Good evening. Welcome to Mississippi.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  So, Senator, conservatives are increasingly using the socialist label as a means of attack. So how and to what degree with your policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance, offering financially challenged Americans a hand up, but not a handout?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, you know, this one really -- this is just a reminder that folks can say whatever they want, but the reality is, at least for me, I believe in markets and I believe in the value that we get out of markets. But it's got to be markets with rules. You know, market without rules is theft.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But a market with rules, a market with rules, a market with a cop on the beat to enforce those rules, that's how it is that small businesses get a chance to start and to grow. That's how it is that employees get to move from one place to another. That's how it is that we get new products. I'm a supporter of markets with rules.   </p><p>      And what's wrong right now in Washington is the big folks, they don't want rules.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      These giant corporations, they just want to be able to run over whoever they want to run over. And if that means run over their own employees, then, by golly, they'll do it. If that means run over their customers, by golly, they'll do it. If that means running over their local communities, by golly, they will do it.   </p><p>      So the way I see this is we not only need a government that's on our side with these rules. We need big, systemic change. And that means we need more balance out there in the marketplace.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I'll tell you, real quick, a couple of ways we can do that. The first one is, we need for employees to have more power, and that means we need to make it easier to join a union and unions need to have more power once people have joined.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Unions built America's middle class. Unions will rebuild America's middle class. That's how we make it happen. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  And we should note, you're here in Mississippi, you're focusing on housing for people who are struggling. You have a plan to try to tackle that. You say it's going to help lower rent. How does that work?   </p><p>      does that work?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I have a proposal to build about 3 million new housing units across America.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I just want to stop for a second. Anybody in here worry about the rise price of housing? Right? Yeah, that's pretty much everybody, right?   </p><p>      The idea is that we need to make a real investment in housing. In the same way that we think about health care as a basic human right, having a decent and safe place to live should be a basic human right.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And the squeeze is everywhere. It's the poor, it's the working poor, it's the working class, it's the middle class, shoot, it even kind of moves up into the upper middle class, that people feel squeezed on housing, because we just don't have enough affordable housing across this country.   </p><p>      So I believe what we should do is we should make a big investment in housing. And by the way, if we do that, independent analysis from Moody's says that we would lower rents across this country by about 10 percent -- that's across the board -- and we'd create an opportunity for more people to become buyers.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So housing is important. And if I can, Jake, I want to tell you about one other part of this. This bill also addresses the black-white gap in housing that comes from generation after generation, not just a passive discrimination, but realize that into the 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing the purchase of homes for white families and discriminating against black families. That's red-lining.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      This bill tackles that head on. And it says for people who are living in formally red-lined areas, there's going to be special assistance for first-time homebuyers, for people who got cheated in the run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, some special assistance for folks to be able to get that first home and to start building the generation after generation of wealth.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      It's a step in the right direction.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  We're going to take a very quick break. We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campus of Jackson State University.   </p><p>      We're going to go to the questioners in a second, but before we do, I do want to ask a little bit about your personal story, because voters nationwide are just getting to know you. You grew up in Oklahoma.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I did.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  And you've talked about how your family stood at the brink...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  There's one.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  One person from Oklahoma.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  There we go.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Welcome to Mississippi. So you talked about how your family stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good part of your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, I'll tell you about that. So I have three older brothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was their ticket to America's middle class.   </p><p>      I was the late-in-life baby. My mother always just called me \"the surprise.\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      And about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heart attack, and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The church neighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time.   </p><p>      He survived, but he couldn't go back to work. And we lost our family's station wagon. And at night, I'd hear my parents talk, and that's where I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" And I remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and laying out on the bed is the dress.   </p><p>      And some people here will know the dress. It's the one that only comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. And my mother is in her slip, and she's stocking feet, and she's pacing back and forth, and she's crying. She's saying, \"We will not lose this house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. She had never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified.   </p><p>      And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together, put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, and walked to the Sears and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage job saved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.   </p><p>      Anybody who wants to know me has just heard this story. But here's the thing for me now. For a long time, I used to think that was just a story about my mother, how when you get scared, you reach down and you find what you have to find and you bring it up.   </p><p>      And then, years later, I came to understand this is a story about millions of Americans, who -- it doesn't matter if you're scared. When you got to do something to take care of people you love, you reach down, you find it, and you pull it up.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And then it was years later that I came to understand it was also a story about government, because when this happened to my family, the minimum wage in America would support a family of three. It would take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on the table.   </p><p>      Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep a mama and a baby out of poverty. I am in this fight...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      ... because I believe that is wrong.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You know, it's -- for me, there's the whole story of why I'm in this fight. Washington once asked the question, at least on minimum wage, what does it take to support a family, to get a little toe in the door? Today, I hear them in Washington. They ask, what will improve the profitability of giant multinational banks?   </p><p>      Well, I want a government that doesn't work for giant multinational corporations. I want one that works for little families like mine.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Latoya Hubbard. She works for a defense contracting firm here in Mississippi. Latoya?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Latoya.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Do you have any plans of relieving federally funded, overwhelming student loan debt burdens, in that many middle-class and poor individuals obtained those loans to create a better future, but are having issues doing that?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, Latoya, the answer is yes. I have got plans to reduce student loan debt. Let me just start there.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But, you know, there are parts of this that are so personal. I've had one dream since I was in second grade. There's just one thing I wanted to be. All three of my brothers went off and joined the military, and God bless them. Do you know what I wanted to be? I wanted to be a public schoolteacher from the time I was in second grade. Can we hear it for America's public schoolteachers? Yeah.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But you've got to have a four-year diploma to do that. And by the time I graduated high school, my family didn't have the money for a college application, much less to send me off to school. And I have a long and twisty story, got a scholarship, then I fell in love...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      ... got married, the first time.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And I thought I'd lost it all. I thought I was -- I thought I had given up on that dream. And I found a commuter college, public college, that cost $50 a semester. And that was my ticket. And I became a special needs teacher. I got to live my dream.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So let me just say, I believe in what we can do through education. But if America wants to be a stronger country, America wants to be a country of real opportunity for everyone, then that means that every kid has a right to get an education without getting crushed by student loan debt, period.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  While we're on the subject -- while we're on the subject of education, our next question has to do with the place we're standing in right now, a historically black university.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Kathy Johnson. She works in banking in Ridgeland, Mississippi. Kathy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Kathy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Being a graduate of a historically black college and university, I see firsthand how we are the first to lose funding or to have budget cuts.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  How would you make it a priority that we receive more funding and being able to compete with non-historically black colleges and universities?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. So, great question.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I believe in HBCUs. I just want to say, I am the proud recipient of a diploma that was granted to me at Morgan State University, so...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      As part of their commencement address. So, let me put it this way. What we've got to do is we've got to be willing to invest more in our colleges and universities across the board. We have got to bring down the cost of an education.   </p><p>      of an education.   </p><p>      And for the schools that are serving the students who often come from -- first time to come to college, from families that struggle more, then that means we've got to double down and double down a second time to make sure they have the resources they need.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And it's not enough just for somebody to stand here and talk about it generally. I want you to know, I get this one. Right now, in America, African American students are more likely to have to borrow money to go to college. They're more likely to borrow more money. And they are more likely to have trouble paying off that debt when they leave college. That is a national disgrace.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And part of dealing with our student loan debt burden needs to focus on that specifically. So, thank you. It's a good question. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Brennan Breeland. He's a lawyer and an officer in the Army Reserves. Brennan?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, Senator.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Brennan.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  How do you respond to people who think that, regardless of the underlying facts, the way you handled the question of your Native American heritage was tone-deaf, offensive, and indicative of a lack of presidential tact?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Well, you know, I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned about my family from my family. And based on that, that's just kind of who I am. And I do the best I can with it.   </p><p>      You know, there was an investigation. Nothing I ever did or my family played any role in any job I ever got.   </p><p>      But I'll tell you this. I have now done 38 town halls in Massachusetts last year, and this is my 32nd town hall since January. And what I've discovered is that people care a lot about what's happening to their lives every single day and what touches them, like housing and education and health care. That's the kind of reason that I'm in this fight. And I'm going to stay in this fight.   </p><p>      And I'll tell you this. I'm going to fight it from the heart every inch of the way. I'll do my best.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  The next question comes from Rukia Lumumba. She's a legal advocate and community organizer here in Jackson. She also happens to be the sister and former campaign manager of Jackson's current mayor. Chokwe Antar Lumumba, her late father, Chokwe Lumumba, was also once the mayor of this city, as well. Rukia?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Good to see you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you for being here. Welcome to Jackson, Mississippi. Yeah. So voter disenfranchisement is real. In Mississippi, there are 23 felonies that once convicted ban a person from voting for the rest of their lives, literally limiting their citizenship and right to democracy. Moreover, residents' access to voting is limited by archaic voter registration processes and limited voting formats. How will you expand voting rights to the formerly incarcerated, ensure online voter registration, and non-excuse early voting?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Great question. But can I go you one bigger?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  And that is, I believe we need a constitutional amendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizen and to make sure that vote gets counted.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We need to put some federal muscle behind that. And we need to repeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out there right now.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I'll tell you one more. We need to make sure that every vote counts. And, you know, I want to -- I want to push that right here in Mississippi, because I think this is an important point. You know, come a general election, presidential candidates don't come to places like Mississippi.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  That's right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah. They also don't come to places like California and Massachusetts, right? Because we're not the \"battleground states.\" Well, my view is that every vote matters. And the way we can make that happen...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      ... is that we can have national voting. And that means get rid of the Electoral College and everybody counts.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Everybody.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I think everybody ought to have to come and ask for your vote. What do you think? Yeah.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Hannah Burnell Williams from here in Jackson. She's hoping to go to graduate school. Hannah?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Senator Warren.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Hannah.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Recently, many leaders in our nation have taken a stance on whether or not Confederate symbols should remain in the public eye in many of our cities, towns, and parks. As a presidential hopeful, do you have any plans on addressing the removal or lack thereof, of the reminders of this nation's dark past or have any plans on preserving the nation's history in a way that explains it in a more educational sense versus showing praise to the losing side?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. You put it right.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So, I would support removing Confederate celebrations from federal lands and putting them in museums where they belong. That's right. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Let me follow up, if I can, because Mississippi is the only state in the country that still has the Confederate battle emblem on the state flag. Do you think Mississippi should adopt a new flag?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  That was the shortest answer I've ever gotten from a politician in my life. We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're living in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall. We're here with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson State University in Mississippi.   </p><p>      In 2018, Jackson, Mississippi, had it highest homicide rate in more than 20 years, with 84 murders. According to local media, it's among the highest murder rates in the country. On that topic, I want to bring in Arreone Hill. She's an accountant for the office of the state treasurer. Arreone?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. With Jackson, Mississippi, having a very high homicide rate, will there be any revisions to gun control to help ensure less killings throughout the metropolitan city?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So here's how I look at this. Laws should reflect our values. Laws are about our morals. And right now, across this country, we lose on average seven children and teenagers every single day to gun violence. Just pause for a minute and think, if we were losing seven children every single day to some mysterious virus, man, we'd be pulling out all the stops to say what can we do to change that, where's the medicine we need to develop, how can we respond, what do we need to do?   </p><p>      But instead, with gun violence, right now we don't do anything, not even the most sensible kinds of things, background checks...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      ... at the federal level. No fly, no buy. Like if you're on the terrorist watch list, maybe you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      That weapons of war do not belong on our streets.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      No bump stocks to make it easier to kill. No.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      There's so much that we could do to improve safety for our children and for all of us, things that people agree with who are gun-owners and things that people agree with who are not gun-owners. And we have to do them at a federal level, because the problem is, even if you change your laws right here in Mississippi, if they don't change their laws in the other states, if they still have the gun show loopholes, somebody can just go there, put it in the back of a pickup, and come on down.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So this is a national problem. It goes back to the question I've been talking about, who does government work for? Right now, it works for the wealthy and the well-connected, and that means we have a federal government being held hostage by the NRA. I believe we can fight back and we can change that together.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Senator, let me bring in Samantha Manning. She works here at Jackson State University as an administrative assistant in the Disabilities Services Department. Samantha?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Samantha.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hello. As a mother of black boys, I am constantly reminded of a judicial system where the scales are often weighed against them, and those that have sworn to protect them, fear them, and are most often ruled justified in excessive actions against other children who look like them. As president, how would you address the concerns that I and many other parents like me have when it comes to protecting our children and restoring our faith in the judicial system?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, thank you very much.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I start with the principle, the four words carved above the United States Supreme Court, \"Equal justice under law.\" That's what I believe in.  </p><p>      But I understand today in America we don't have that.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  That's right. Race matters, and we need to call it out.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Now, I'd like to follow some of the very practical efforts that Barack Obama, President Obama, put into place when he had his Justice Department going after the police departments that were violating the rights of young black men and women across this country.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I know there's much to criticize this administration about, but the very fact that the Justice Department under President Obama had worked with police departments around the country -- and they were -- they were not finished, but had worked with, and some had already reached the point of signing consent decrees, of starting new training, of trying to put themselves on a better path.   </p><p>      There are many good people in law enforcement who want this to work and want to make it work if they have the right resources, if they have the right opportunities, if they can do community policing. That's where President Obama was leading us, and this administration pulled that out of the Justice Department, reversed it, and that makes the world a lot more dangerous for everyone. I would reverse that and go where President Obama went. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Mary Crump. She's a retired nurse from Jackson. Mary?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you, Senator Warren, for being here. How do you plan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Whoa!   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So, look, we need big structural change in this country. And that means the kind of -- let's just admit it. When you've got a government that works for the rich and it's not working nearly as well for anyone else, that's corruption, and we need to call it out plain and simple.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So the first thing we need to do is we need to attack that corruption head on. I have the biggest anti-corruption bill since Watergate. Big problem, you got to have a big bill to deal with it.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Now, it's got a lot of pieces to it, but the main point is to beat back on the influence of money, because that's how they keep getting this government, getting this country to work for them. So, for example, my bill says we're going to end lobbying as we know it.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Lock the revolving door between Main Street -- between Wall Street and Washington.   </p><p>      I'll give you one more. Everyone who runs for federal office ought to have to put their taxes online, everyone.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So, part one, we got to deal with the corruption head on. But let me give you a part two. I was talking earlier about we got to rewrite the rules in this economy. And part of that is putting more power back in the hands of workers. Unions, that's one way to do it. I've got an accountable capitalism bill that says, on the big Fortune 500 companies, that we're going to have employees also sit on the board of directors and help make decisions.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But there's one more we've got to talk about, and that is my ultra-millionaires tax. So the idea is, on the truly great fortunes, $50 million and above, we start charging 2 percent a year on just that $50 millionth and first dollar and on up, 2 percent a year.   </p><p>      And by the way, anybody in here a homeowner?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You've been paying wealth taxes for a long time. They're just called property taxes. I just want to include the Rembrandt and the diamonds in the property taxes. So...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So I'm going to put a wealth tax in place. And I just want to talk to you for one minute about how that restructures our whole economy. We get a 2 percent tax on the 75,000 richest families in this country, we would have enough money to provide universal childcare, universal Pre-K, universal Pre-Pre-K for every child in America, and still have $2 trillion left over. Let's make it happen.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.   </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campus of Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.   </p><p>      I want to bring in Marcy Croft, she is a lawyer from Madison, Mississippi. Marcy?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Marcy.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. Hi, Senator. You have proposed breaking up the big tech companies.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Is it really possible to increase regulation of private tech companies without stifling innovation?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Oh, good question, Marcy. But here's my point. If you break them up, you actually need less regulation. Because here's how this works right now. Think about the big tech companies -- Amazon, Facebook, Google, right?   </p><p>      Here's what they do. They run a platform, OK, where people come -- let's just stick with Amazon. That's where you go to check out 63 coffee makers, all of which can be delivered in 24 hours, right?   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      And think about this, just so you get an idea of how vast they are right now in our economy. Walmart is about 9 percent of all physical retail sales in America. Amazon, 49 percent of all online. So this is a big deal. If you want to sell online, you're a little guy, you're trying to get your business started, you're an entrepreneur, you've got to be there.   </p><p>      So Amazon runs this platform. You come to the platform. All sounds great. But Amazon also is collecting information on every single buyer who visits and on every single seller who's there, and on every single transaction. And what it does is it has the capacity to look out there and see, you know, Pete's pet pillows, and say, whoa, Pete had a good idea here. He's making money off this. So here's what we're going to do. We're going to take Pete off page one, move him back to page 16, where nobody goes, and then Amazon Pete Pet Pillows is going to step right in front of him.   </p><p>      You know, think of it this way like in baseball. You can be an umpire, run the platform, or you can have a team in the game, run one of the businesses competing with the other businesses. But you don't get to do both at the same time.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So here's my pitch. I just want to break those two things apart. I want you still to be able to go and check out all the coffeemakers you want to check out. The platform works. But nobody gets to suck a lot of information off the platform for the purpose of being able to put a bunch of little businesses out of business.   </p><p>      We want to have more competition in America, break up those tech giants. We can make that work.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  The next question comes from Rodney Smith. He's a lawn maintenance contractor here in Jackson. Rodney?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Rodney.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening. The cities of America have crumbling infrastructure. How would you combat these issues? These are problems that everyone knows about but have failed to do anything about these problems.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Right. All right, it's a good question. So, look, think of infrastructure this way. I kind of think of it like a farmer plows the fields. We get out there together through our government, and we build the roads and the bridges, we put up the communications system, we do these things together because you can't start a little business and at the same time try to build the road in front of your house, right? So you need all these pieces to make it work. A farmer who does a good job of planting the fields, it means a lot of seeds get to grow and to go forward.   </p><p>      Now, what's happened in America is that we've cut back on making those infrastructure investments. And you all see it every day. You see it in your lives. You see it when you see roads that are crumbling, bridges that are dangerous. Yeah, you're all seeing this, right?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So understand, it's worse than what you see, because America competes all around the world now. That's just the reality. And right now, here in America, we are spending about 0.6 percent, just a smidge, on our infrastructure. In fact, some people say it's not even enough to replace what's breaking and falling apart. China, by comparison, is spending about 5 percent of its GDP on infrastructure. It is spending eight times more, almost nine times more on its infrastructure.   </p><p>      It's building a future for those small businesses, for those medium-sized businesses, for those giant businesses. It is building a future for work in China. We need to step up our investment in infrastructure right here in the United States of America.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      That's how we build a future.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)   </p><p>      And I'll add one little piece to it and say, when you take a look at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building the infrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Let me bring in Maggie Spitz. She works at a public library in Madison, Mississippi. Maggie?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Presently the state of Mississippi imposes a special tax on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles as a penalty for paying less in gas taxes. Do you believe this is the right approach, considering the warnings about climate change? And what would you propose to encourage the increased use of alternative energy?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  OK. So, can we just start with the issue of climate change? And I want to say something that is very controversial. So, most of you are sitting down. Maggie, is it? You may want to sit down, too, OK, or just hold on to a chair. Because I spend time in Washington. In Washington, this is a very controversial statement:  I believe in science.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Climate change is real, it is manmade, and we are running out of runway to be able to fix this problem.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We need all hands on deck on this one. So I mentioned earlier, as part of infrastructure, we need to be thinking about infrastructure in terms of hardening our infrastructure against the climate change that's coming our way and in terms of building green energy infrastructure.   </p><p>      We need to do more, though. We've got to be working in every single direction. More money on research. More money on how we get our vehicles so that we get to a place where we have a sustainable Earth. This is truly the crisis that faces not just our nation, but the world.   </p><p>      The United States is a world leader. The problem is we are leading in the wrong direction right now on climate.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We've got to go the other way. We've got to show the world what can be done. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Senator, I just want to follow up on Maggie's question, because she talked about the gas tax. As you know, the federal gas tax has not been raised...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  ... since 1993, leaving many states to fend for themselves to maintain the roads and bridges. Would you support, theoretically, raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructure needs?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, you know, I'll tell you what worries about doing this through gas tax. I'm open to the conversation, but what worries me is it falls hardest on working people. When I talk about raising taxes, what I really want to see is I want to see an ultra-millionaire's tax.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I want to see taxes on the top. And then let's use that to help subsidize what it is that we really want to see:  Cleaner vehicles. That's the direction I'd much rather see us go. I want to get us there, but I want to do it the other way.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  The next question comes from Ally Mack, a longtime Jackson resident, who served as the dean of international studies here at Jackson State University. Dean Mack?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  What is your position on the impeachment of Donald Trump?   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, we have a report that is due from the special prosecutor any day now. Understand that that investigation from Mr. Mueller has produced already -- I believe it's 34 indictments or guilty pleas. This is a serious investigation. We need to protect him in finishing that report. And then that report needs to be made public to the American people.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      When we get it, we will know what to do with it. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Senator Warren, you sit on the Senate Armed Services Committee.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I do.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to introduce you to Daniel Bamrick. He's a U.S. Army veteran who served in Kuwait and Syria who is now a research lab technician. Daniel?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Daniel.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hey, Senator. Good evening.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi. Thank you for your service.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you. Your family, too. Big brothers.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  As a veteran, I've seen the amazing capability of our armed forces.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Mm-hmm.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  But I was also shocked to see the lack of clearly defined goals and objectives coming down from the highest level. It also worries me that military service itself is becoming a very uncommon experience...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yeah.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  ... for the U.S. population at large. So, as president, my question is, what would you do to provide clear, achievable goals for our military and to broaden the participation rate of American citizens in what is their government's largest organization?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you for the question.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Look, with three brothers in the military, my oldest one spent more than five years off and on in combat in Vietnam. We were lucky to get him back home. And my second brother was overseas for over a year. My third brother trained as an Army medic. I understand the sacrifices that our military makes and the sacrifices their families make. I stood there every day and watched my mother as she waited for the mail to hear from my brothers.   </p><p>      We have the best military on Earth.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      They will do whatever we ask them to do. They will go out and fight and, if necessary, die for us. But that puts a sacred responsibility on our leadership to understand that, around the world, we cannot use our military to solve non-military problems.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We need to be willing to use all of the tools in the toolbox, and that means we need to be using our diplomatic tools much stronger. We need to use our economic tools. And we need, when we do feel absolutely pressed to use a military alternative, we need to be clear not just on what our objective is going in, what the measure is of success, but what our plan is to get out on the other side.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We cannot fight endless wars. It's wrong.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  So, Daniel worked in Syria. He served in Syria. You've said it's, quote, \"right to get our troops out of Syria,\" but you did criticize President Trump for failing to plan the withdrawal...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Yes.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  ... with U.S. allies. The U.S. is currently planning to leave 400 or more servicemembers in Syria on what is being called a peacekeeping mission. Would you as president keep any troops on the ground in Syria? And if so, how many?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  I think we need to get out. We need to get out.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Until someone can identify -- and this is the whole point about it. I ask this in hearings in Armed Services. What is the measure of success? If you're going to be there, describe, let us see so we can tell if you're failing or succeeding at this. And no one can come up with an answer. And until they can do that, we need our troops back home.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Jayda Lee, a public health educator from Jackson. Jada?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hello, hi, Jayda.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi. Good evening. Mississippi has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation. Black and brown women make up the majority of those who fall victim to higher rates of pregnancy-related mortality.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Mm-hmm.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Although some of this disparity can be attributed to lack of access, other issues are less easily explained. How would you administration create legislation to improve outcomes for these women?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So, it is an excellent question.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Let me tell you something I've already been working on in this area. This is a place where we need not only more funding for the National Institutes of Health to be able to do the research, but we need to insist that the National Institutes of Health is actually doing research and keeping track of male/female, African American/other races, so that we better understand all of what's wrong.   </p><p>      As you say, we know that part of this is related to lack of access, but that's not explaining everything that's going on. I believe in research. And we've got to support it so that it supports all of our mamas and all of our babies. It's very important.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Thank you.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Senator, I want to bring in Michael Barber. He's a freshman here at Jackson State University. He says he's currently supporting Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run. Michael?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Hi, Michael.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, ma'am. Yeah, my question is we have seen recently kids who have the luxury of parents paying their way into school no matter the GPA. The kids who attend inner city schools do not have that luxury or the resources to excel and they suffer greatly as they become closer to adult life. How would you not only improve, but make the educational system fair for all American people?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  All right. So, thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You know, this scandal just shows one more time that some folks who are rich just think they don't have to play by the same set of rules as anyone else and that they can use their money to do whatever it is in terms of buying influence. We have to put a stop to that.  </p><p>      And it's not just -- it's everywhere now. And we're here talking about a presidential primary. It's everywhere in Washington. You know, I just -- I want to say something about democracy for a minute. I get that we have a lot of differences. There will be some people who have a little more money, some people who have a little less, some people who go further in school, some people who don't. But the one thing we should all own an equal share of is an equal share of our democracy.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      We need a government that doesn't just listen to the rich and the powerful, but a government that listens to all of us. And that starts right now in a Democratic primary. Something you can ask everyone in the Democratic primary who wants to ask for your vote is to ask them where they've been and how they've gotten their funding.   </p><p>      Me, I don't take corporate PAC money. In fact, I don't take PAC money of any kind.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I don't take federal lobbyists' money. And...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And I don't go behind closed doors with people of money and influence to try to get their help in this election. I come here to be with you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Because I believe that our democracy is really on the ropes. We have a country that's working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. In 2020, we have a chance to take that back. We have a chance to build a real grassroots foundation, face to face, person to person, neighborhood to neighborhood.   </p><p>      And if you believe that is how we should be running our presidential primary, I ask you, be part of this. Go to elizabethwarren.com. Be part of this. Make a contribution, volunteer. We're going to have to build this thing ourselves, because democracy is not a machine that will go of itself.  </p><p>      And government, our government, is not for sale. We need a government that works for the people, and that means the people have to be there as part of it. Thank you.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  I have one final question for you, Senator. Faith is very important to many people across the country. It's very important to many people in Mississippi. What role does faith play in your life, your public life and your private life?   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  So I was raised as a Methodist, and...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I was a fifth grade Sunday school teacher. All I can say is, nobody got hurt.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      It was a low bar for being a fifth grade Sunday school teacher at our church. And I raised my children in the Methodist church. What it is for me is the importance of the lessons we learn when we remember our values, when we remember our faith.   </p><p>      The story for me is Matthew 26, and I'm sure some of you -- a lot of you know this story. You know, this is the one where the shepherd is dividing the world into the sheep and the goats. And as we all know, sheep are going to heaven, goats, nah, they're not.   </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)   </p><p>      And the sheep ask him, why us? Why us, Lord? Why did you pick us? We look like those -- like those guys. And the shepherd, the Lord, answers back by saying, \"I was hungry, and you gave me food. I was thirsty, and you gave me water. I was in prison, and you visited me, naked and ye clothed me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.\"   </p><p>      And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day. The first is there is God, there is value in every single human being.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Every single human being. And the second is that we are called to action.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      That passage is not about you had a good thought and held onto it, you sat back and were just a part of -- you know, thought about good things. It does not say, you just didn't hurt anybody and that's good enough. No.   </p><p>      It says, you saw something wrong, you saw somebody who was thirsty, you saw somebody who was in prison.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You saw their face. You saw somebody who was hungry, and it moved you to act. I believe we are called on to act.   </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TAPPER</emphasis>:  Our thank you to Senator Elizabeth warren. Thank you, as well, to our audience here and to Jackson State University. Great questions from all of you. Thank you so much.  </p><p>      Be sure to tune in Wednesday night at 10 p.m. Eastern. Dana Bash will moderate the next CNN Democratic candidate town hall with former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. \"CNN Tonight\" starts right now.   </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WARREN</emphasis>:  Thank you.   </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP1-FW91-F15W-H39K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     TAPPER:  Good evening from Jackson, Mississippi, and welcome toa CNN Democratic presidential candidate town hall with SenatorElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. I'm Jake Tapper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are live at Jackson State University, a historically blackuniversity founded in 1877 for the first major Democratic 2020 eventin the state of Mississippi. We're here with Senator Warren, aformer special needs teacher and law professor who made her namefighting the big banks. If elected, she would make history as thefirst female president of the United States of America.</p><p>Tonight, Senator Warren will take questions from Democrats andindependents who say they plan to participate in the Democraticprimaries and caucuses. Please welcome Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Hey, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER:  How are you? Good to see you.</p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Have a seat.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, this is fun.</p><p>TAPPER:  So before we begin, you're a former law professor. Feelgood to be back on a campus?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, it always feels good to be back on a campus.Absolutely.</p><p>TAPPER:  Which is more fun, teaching law students, teaching on acampus, or working with senators in the U.S. Senate?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, teaching. Are you kidding?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Much more fun.</p><p>TAPPER:  I thought you might give that answer.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let's start with our first town hall question. Thefirst one comes from Christopher Lane. He's a doctoral candidate inpublic health here at Jackson State University. Christopher?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator Warren. My question is,Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states inthe country, yet many white poor and working-class citizens continueto vote against their economic interests. What message, if any, doyou have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to votefor you?</p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you for the question, Christopher. Look, thisis how I see it. Washington is working great, it's workingfabulously for giant drug companies. It's just not working forpeople who are trying to get a prescription filled.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for big oil companies that want to drilleverywhere. It's just not working for people who see climate changebearing down upon us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for giant financial institutions and forpayday lenders. It's just not working great for people who areliving paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich and thepowerful. I want a Washington that works for the rest of America.That's why I'm in this fight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I believe on that, that Democrats, independents, andRepublicans, they know a scam when they see it. And they see aWashington working for those guys. I think they're ready to get inthe fight and get a Washington and a country that works for the restof America. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  So our next -- our next questioner is Khalita Hicks.She's a supporter of yours and a Spanish language translator fromJackson. Khalita?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Khalita.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening. Since the election of Donald Trump, thenumber of hate crimes has increased and white supremacists havebecome more emboldened online and in public. What are your plans tounite the country?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good. Thank you for that question. You know, itstarts with the fact that we've got to recognize the threat posed bywhite nationalism. White supremacists pose a threat to the UnitedStates like any other terrorist group, like ISIS, like Al Qaida.</p><p>And leadership starts at the top. And that means you've got tocall it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No sitting by. And then when you call it out, as president ofthe United States, you've got to use the tools available to you. Andthat means get the Justice Department when they break the law to goafter them with full prosecution. That's what I can do. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you. Good question.</p><p>TAPPER:  Our next question comes from Georgia Cohran. She's agraduate student here at Jackson State University. Georgia?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you, Senator Warren, for taking myquestion.</p><p>TAPPER:  Got to hold the mike up there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you so much for taking my question. I am anAfrican-American female with -- I'm an African-American female withfive beautiful adult children and 10 grandchildren.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Georgia, count your blessings every day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION:  Please, please, describe to me what a public apologyto -- for 400 years of free labor...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... in the South, especially Mississippi, will looklike in the African American community in the new election.</p><p>WARREN:  All right, thank you, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION:  In the new administration.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom,and on the backs of slave labor. This is a stain on America, andwe're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until weaddress it head on, directly.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And make no mistake:  It's not just the original founding. It'swhat's happened generation after generation. The impact ofdiscrimination handed down from one to the next means that today inAmerica, because of housing discrimination, because of employmentdiscrimination, we live in a world where for the average whitefamily has $100, the average black family has about $5.</p><p>So I believe it's time to start the national full-blownconversation about reparations in this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint acongressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, whotalk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make areport back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what's rightand begin to heal. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, if I could just follow up on -- if I couldjust follow up on Georgia's question, you've said you're open to aconversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and alsoto Native Americans, you also said. Might that include directpayments, direct financial transfer of money?</p><p>WARREN:  So there are a lot of ways to think about howreparations should be formed. And I noticed, Georgia's questionactually started with just the frame of an apology, right, with theframe of a national recognition.</p><p>We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activistswho have a whole lot of different approaches to it. And I think thebest we can do right now -- I love the idea of this congressionalcommission. Let's bring people together and let's open thatconversation as Americans. Let's see what ideas people want to puton the table, and let's talk them through, because I got to tellyou, ignoring the problem is not working.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Jay Kucia. He's a supporter of yours,as well. He's a student who founded a labor rights group at theUniversity of Mississippi Law School. That's in Oxford, I believe.</p><p>WARREN:  Right.</p><p>TAPPER:  He has a question about Medicare for all. Jay?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>QUESTION:  Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here thisevening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care. As asupporter of universal health care and an advocate for organizedlabor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of privatehealth insurance...</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... that would eliminate the private healthemployer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for. Can youexplain how Medicare for all would be better for workers than simplyimproving the Affordable Care Act?</p><p>WARREN:  OK, so it's a good question. Let's start with ourstatement that we should make every time we start to talk aboutchanges in our health care, and that is health care is a basic humanright and we fight for basic human rights.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate thatyour question starts with the Affordable Care Act. Let's allremember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start wherewe are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expandhealth care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody iscovered. Republicans right this minute are out there trying torepeal the Affordable Care Act. They've got a lawsuit pending downin Texas where they're trying to roll it back. What they couldn't dowith a vote, they're trying to do with the courts. HHS every day isdoing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>So when we're talking about health care in America right now,the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the AffordableCare Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Then part two. Let's make the improvements that are what Ithink of as low-hanging fruit. For example, let's bring down thecost of prescription drugs all across this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We got lots of ways we can do that. We can import drugs fromCanada where the safety standards are the same. That would cut costsdramatically. We can negotiate the prices under Medicare. That wouldcut costs dramatically.</p><p>And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on genericdrugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions. Solet's get those costs down.</p><p>And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumeradvocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companiesaccountable. And that means no tricking and trapping people on thoseinsurance contracts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lotof different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest costway to make sure everybody gets covered. And some folks are talkingabout let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55,50. That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful,for example, to the labor's plans.</p><p>Some people say, do it the other way. Let's bring it up from --everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare. Others say letemployees be able to buy into the Medicare plans. Others say let'slet employees buy into the Medicare plans.</p><p>For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this,that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on theirown, everybody comes to the table together. And we figure out how todo Medicare for all in a way that makes sure that we're going to get100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost foreveryone. That's our job.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You like that?</p><p>TAPPER:  If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question,so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for allbill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths touniversal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored wouldessentially eliminate private insurance. Is that something you couldsupport?</p><p>WARREN:  He's got a runway for that. I think we get everybodytogether. And that's what it is, we'll decide. I've alsoco-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as anotherapproach that we use. But what's really important to me about thisis we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center isabout making sure that every single person in this country gets thecoverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford. Westart with our values, we'll get to the right place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, theoretically, though, there could be a role forprivate insurance companies under President Warren?</p><p>WARREN:  There could. Or there could be a temporary role. EvenBernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's --look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure thatwe land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got tostay covered. It's critical.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Kari Johnson. She's a high schoolprincipal in Canton, Mississippi. Kari?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kari.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello, Senator Warren, and thank you for coming.</p><p>WARREN:  I'm glad to be here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Obviously, building a wall will not preventforeigners from crossing on U.S. land.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  What will you do -- what will you put in place tocontrol the influx of migrants?</p><p>WARREN:  OK. So let me just start where I think of our wholeimmigration policy, and that is, we need to have policies onimmigration that are consistent with our values.</p><p>We are a country that is built on our differences. That is ourstrength, not our weakness. And when people come to the UnitedStates because they are fleeing terror in Central America, they fearfor their lives, then we have a moral responsibility to listen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... and to be there. You know, if I can just take a minute tosay on this one, I went down to the border last year when the wordfirst began to come out about children taken away from theirmothers. And I just want you all to envision this.</p><p>Think of a big, old Amazon warehouse, only dirty and smelledbad. And when I walked in on my left were cages, maybe 10 feet wide,40 feet deep, a toilet back in the corner, one after another afteranother crammed full of men. On the right, one after another afteranother crammed full of women. And then you walk into the main area,and there were cages about the size of this central area here withnothing but little girls in it. And over there, nothing but littleboys.</p><p>That's not who we are. That is not the country we want to be.And an immigration system that is administered so that it is notable to tell the difference between a criminal, a terrorist, and a12-year-old little girl is an immigration system that not only isnot keeping us safer, it does not reflect our values.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I will not support the building of a wall that does not make ussafer. The administration itself, people within it, have alreadysaid this is not about security, this is not how we're going to makeourselves safer. The kind of wall that is proposed now is a monumentto hate and division. We are a better country than that. So, I'lljust stop there. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, Senator, just to follow up, so Kari's specificquestion was what will you put in place to control the influx ofmigrants.</p><p>WARREN:  So -- I should hit both of those. You're exactly right.One thing we can do is remember all the tools in the toolbox. Andthat is, when there's a problem in Central America, because thegangs have taken over, because the local officials can't manage,then that's not a point at which we should be cutting our aid.</p><p>If we want to stop the problem of mamas fleeing for theirlives, then let's make a little more investment in the areas thatare troubled. And let's help people be able to stay where they aresafely.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's a much kinder way to do it.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Paul Buckley. He's a high schoolhistory teacher from Jackson. Paul?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, how are you, Paul?</p><p>QUESTION:  Doing well. Good evening. Welcome to Mississippi.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION:  So, Senator, conservatives are increasingly using thesocialist label as a means of attack. So how and to what degree withyour policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance,offering financially challenged Americans a hand up, but not ahandout?</p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, this one really -- this is just areminder that folks can say whatever they want, but the reality is,at least for me, I believe in markets and I believe in the valuethat we get out of markets. But it's got to be markets with rules.You know, market without rules is theft.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But a market with rules, a market with rules, a market with acop on the beat to enforce those rules, that's how it is that smallbusinesses get a chance to start and to grow. That's how it is thatemployees get to move from one place to another. That's how it isthat we get new products. I'm a supporter of markets with rules.</p><p>And what's wrong right now in Washington is the big folks, theydon't want rules.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>These giant corporations, they just want to be able to run overwhoever they want to run over. And if that means run over their ownemployees, then, by golly, they'll do it. If that means run overtheir customers, by golly, they'll do it. If that means running overtheir local communities, by golly, they will do it.</p><p>So the way I see this is we not only need a government that'son our side with these rules. We need big, systemic change. And thatmeans we need more balance out there in the marketplace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you, real quick, a couple of ways we can do that.The first one is, we need for employees to have more power, and thatmeans we need to make it easier to join a union and unions need tohave more power once people have joined.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Unions built America's middle class. Unions will rebuildAmerica's middle class. That's how we make it happen. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  And we should note, you're here in Mississippi, you'refocusing on housing for people who are struggling. You have a planto try to tackle that. You say it's going to help lower rent. Howdoes that work?</p><p>does that work?</p><p>WARREN:  So I have a proposal to build about 3 million newhousing units across America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I just want to stop for a second. Anybody in here worryabout the rise price of housing? Right? Yeah, that's pretty mucheverybody, right?</p><p>The idea is that we need to make a real investment in housing.In the same way that we think about health care as a basic humanright, having a decent and safe place to live should be a basichuman right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And the squeeze is everywhere. It's the poor, it's the workingpoor, it's the working class, it's the middle class, shoot, it evenkind of moves up into the upper middle class, that people feelsqueezed on housing, because we just don't have enough affordablehousing across this country.</p><p>So I believe what we should do is we should make a biginvestment in housing. And by the way, if we do that, independentanalysis from Moody's says that we would lower rents across thiscountry by about 10 percent -- that's across the board -- and we'dcreate an opportunity for more people to become buyers.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So housing is important. And if I can, Jake, I want to tell youabout one other part of this. This bill also addresses theblack-white gap in housing that comes from generation aftergeneration, not just a passive discrimination, but realize that intothe 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing thepurchase of homes for white families and discriminating againstblack families. That's red-lining.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>This bill tackles that head on. And it says for people who areliving in formally red-lined areas, there's going to be specialassistance for first-time homebuyers, for people who got cheated inthe run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, some specialassistance for folks to be able to get that first home and to startbuilding the generation after generation of wealth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's a step in the right direction.</p><p>TAPPER:  We're going to take a very quick break. We'll be rightback with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate townhall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson,Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campusof Jackson State University.</p><p>We're going to go to the questioners in a second, but before wedo, I do want to ask a little bit about your personal story, becausevoters nationwide are just getting to know you. You grew up inOklahoma.</p><p>WARREN:  I did.</p><p>TAPPER:  And you've talked about how your family stood at thebrink...</p><p>WARREN:  There's one.</p><p>TAPPER:  One person from Oklahoma.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WARREN:  There we go.</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome to Mississippi. So you talked about how yourfamily stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good partof your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?</p><p>WARREN:  So, I'll tell you about that. So I have three olderbrothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was theirticket to America's middle class.</p><p>I was the late-in-life baby. My mother always just called me\"the surprise.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heartattack, and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The churchneighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time.</p><p>He survived, but he couldn't go back to work. And we lost ourfamily's station wagon. And at night, I'd hear my parents talk, andthat's where I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" AndI remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and layingout on the bed is the dress.</p><p>And some people here will know the dress. It's the one thatonly comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. And mymother is in her slip, and she's stocking feet, and she's pacingback and forth, and she's crying. She's saying, \"We will not losethis house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. Shehad never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified.</p><p>And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together,put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, and walkedto the Sears and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage jobsaved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.</p><p>Anybody who wants to know me has just heard this story. Buthere's the thing for me now. For a long time, I used to think thatwas just a story about my mother, how when you get scared, you reachdown and you find what you have to find and you bring it up.</p><p>And then, years later, I came to understand this is a storyabout millions of Americans, who -- it doesn't matter if you'rescared. When you got to do something to take care of people youlove, you reach down, you find it, and you pull it up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then it was years later that I came to understand it wasalso a story about government, because when this happened to myfamily, the minimum wage in America would support a family of three.It would take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on thetable.</p><p>Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep amama and a baby out of poverty. I am in this fight...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... because I believe that is wrong.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, it's -- for me, there's the whole story of why I'm inthis fight. Washington once asked the question, at least on minimumwage, what does it take to support a family, to get a little toe inthe door? Today, I hear them in Washington. They ask, what willimprove the profitability of giant multinational banks?</p><p>Well, I want a government that doesn't work for giantmultinational corporations. I want one that works for littlefamilies like mine.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Latoya Hubbard. She works for adefense contracting firm here in Mississippi. Latoya?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Latoya.</p><p>QUESTION:  Do you have any plans of relieving federally funded,overwhelming student loan debt burdens, in that many middle-classand poor individuals obtained those loans to create a better future,but are having issues doing that?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Latoya, the answer is yes. I have got plans toreduce student loan debt. Let me just start there.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, there are parts of this that are so personal.I've had one dream since I was in second grade. There's just onething I wanted to be. All three of my brothers went off and joinedthe military, and God bless them. Do you know what I wanted to be? Iwanted to be a public schoolteacher from the time I was in secondgrade. Can we hear it for America's public schoolteachers? Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But you've got to have a four-year diploma to do that. And bythe time I graduated high school, my family didn't have the moneyfor a college application, much less to send me off to school. And Ihave a long and twisty story, got a scholarship, then I fell inlove...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... got married, the first time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And I thought I'd lost it all. I thought I was -- I thought Ihad given up on that dream. And I found a commuter college, publiccollege, that cost $50 a semester. And that was my ticket. And Ibecame a special needs teacher. I got to live my dream.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So let me just say, I believe in what we can do througheducation. But if America wants to be a stronger country, Americawants to be a country of real opportunity for everyone, then thatmeans that every kid has a right to get an education without gettingcrushed by student loan debt, period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  While we're on the subject -- while we're on thesubject of education, our next question has to do with the placewe're standing in right now, a historically black university.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Kathy Johnson. She works in bankingin Ridgeland, Mississippi. Kathy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kathy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Being a graduate of ahistorically black college and university, I see firsthand how weare the first to lose funding or to have budget cuts.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  How would you make it a priority that we receive morefunding and being able to compete with non-historically blackcolleges and universities?</p><p>WARREN:  All right. So, great question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I believe in HBCUs. I just want to say, I am the proudrecipient of a diploma that was granted to me at Morgan StateUniversity, so...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>As part of their commencement address. So, let me put it thisway. What we've got to do is we've got to be willing to invest morein our colleges and universities across the board. We have got tobring down the cost of an education.</p><p>of an education.</p><p>And for the schools that are serving the students who oftencome from -- first time to come to college, from families thatstruggle more, then that means we've got to double down and doubledown a second time to make sure they have the resources they need.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's not enough just for somebody to stand here and talkabout it generally. I want you to know, I get this one. Right now,in America, African American students are more likely to have toborrow money to go to college. They're more likely to borrow moremoney. And they are more likely to have trouble paying off that debtwhen they leave college. That is a national disgrace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And part of dealing with our student loan debt burden needs tofocus on that specifically. So, thank you. It's a good question.Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Brennan Breeland. He's a lawyer andan officer in the Army Reserves. Brennan?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Brennan.</p><p>QUESTION:  How do you respond to people who think that,regardless of the underlying facts, the way you handled the questionof your Native American heritage was tone-deaf, offensive, andindicative of a lack of presidential tact?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, you know, I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned aboutmy family from my family. And based on that, that's just kind of whoI am. And I do the best I can with it.</p><p>You know, there was an investigation. Nothing I ever did or myfamily played any role in any job I ever got.</p><p>But I'll tell you this. I have now done 38 town halls inMassachusetts last year, and this is my 32nd town hall sinceJanuary. And what I've discovered is that people care a lot aboutwhat's happening to their lives every single day and what touchesthem, like housing and education and health care. That's the kind ofreason that I'm in this fight. And I'm going to stay in this fight.</p><p>And I'll tell you this. I'm going to fight it from the heartevery inch of the way. I'll do my best.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rukia Lumumba. She's alegal advocate and community organizer here in Jackson. She alsohappens to be the sister and former campaign manager of Jackson'scurrent mayor. Chokwe Antar Lumumba, her late father, ChokweLumumba, was also once the mayor of this city, as well. Rukia?</p><p>QUESTION:  All right. Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Thank you for being here. Welcome toJackson, Mississippi. Yeah. So voter disenfranchisement is real. InMississippi, there are 23 felonies that once convicted ban a personfrom voting for the rest of their lives, literally limiting theircitizenship and right to democracy. Moreover, residents' access tovoting is limited by archaic voter registration processes andlimited voting formats. How will you expand voting rights to theformerly incarcerated, ensure online voter registration, andnon-excuse early voting?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great question. But can I go you one bigger?</p><p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</p><p>WARREN:  And that is, I believe we need a constitutionalamendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizenand to make sure that vote gets counted.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to put some federal muscle behind that. And we need torepeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out thereright now.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you one more. We need to make sure that everyvote counts. And, you know, I want to -- I want to push that righthere in Mississippi, because I think this is an important point. Youknow, come a general election, presidential candidates don't come toplaces like Mississippi.</p><p>QUESTION:  That's right.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah. They also don't come to places like Californiaand Massachusetts, right? Because we're not the \"battlegroundstates.\" Well, my view is that every vote matters. And the way wecan make that happen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... is that we can have national voting. And that means get ridof the Electoral College and everybody counts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to...</p><p>WARREN:  I think everybody ought to have to come and ask foryour vote. What do you think? Yeah.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Hannah Burnell Williams from here inJackson. She's hoping to go to graduate school. Hannah?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Hannah.</p><p>QUESTION:  Recently, many leaders in our nation have taken astance on whether or not Confederate symbols should remain in thepublic eye in many of our cities, towns, and parks. As apresidential hopeful, do you have any plans on addressing theremoval or lack thereof, of the reminders of this nation's dark pastor have any plans on preserving the nation's history in a way thatexplains it in a more educational sense versus showing praise to thelosing side?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  All right. You put it right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, I would support removing Confederate celebrations fromfederal lands and putting them in museums where they belong. That'sright. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me follow up, if I can, because Mississippi is theonly state in the country that still has the Confederate battleemblem on the state flag. Do you think Mississippi should adopt anew flag?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  That was the shortest answer I've ever gotten from apolitician in my life. We'll be right back with more from CNN'sDemocratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator ElizabethWarren. We're living in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall. We're here with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live inJackson State University in Mississippi.</p><p>In 2018, Jackson, Mississippi, had it highest homicide rate inmore than 20 years, with 84 murders. According to local media, it'samong the highest murder rates in the country. On that topic, I wantto bring in Arreone Hill. She's an accountant for the office of thestate treasurer. Arreone?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. With Jackson, Mississippi, having a very highhomicide rate, will there be any revisions to gun control to helpensure less killings throughout the metropolitan city?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So here's how I look at this. Laws should reflect ourvalues. Laws are about our morals. And right now, across thiscountry, we lose on average seven children and teenagers everysingle day to gun violence. Just pause for a minute and think, if wewere losing seven children every single day to some mysteriousvirus, man, we'd be pulling out all the stops to say what can we doto change that, where's the medicine we need to develop, how can werespond, what do we need to do?</p><p>But instead, with gun violence, right now we don't do anything,not even the most sensible kinds of things, background checks...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... at the federal level. No fly, no buy. Like if you're on theterrorist watch list, maybe you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That weapons of war do not belong on our streets.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No bump stocks to make it easier to kill. No.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>There's so much that we could do to improve safety for ourchildren and for all of us, things that people agree with who aregun-owners and things that people agree with who are not gun-owners.And we have to do them at a federal level, because the problem is,even if you change your laws right here in Mississippi, if theydon't change their laws in the other states, if they still have thegun show loopholes, somebody can just go there, put it in the backof a pickup, and come on down.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So this is a national problem. It goes back to the questionI've been talking about, who does government work for? Right now, itworks for the wealthy and the well-connected, and that means we havea federal government being held hostage by the NRA. I believe we canfight back and we can change that together.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, let me bring in Samantha Manning. She workshere at Jackson State University as an administrative assistant inthe Disabilities Services Department. Samantha?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Samantha.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello. As a mother of black boys, I am constantlyreminded of a judicial system where the scales are often weighedagainst them, and those that have sworn to protect them, fear them,and are most often ruled justified in excessive actions againstother children who look like them. As president, how would youaddress the concerns that I and many other parents like me have whenit comes to protecting our children and restoring our faith in thejudicial system?</p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I start with the principle, the four words carved above theUnited States Supreme Court, \"Equal justice under law.\" That's whatI believe in.</p><p>But I understand today in America we don't have that.</p><p>QUESTION:  Right.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. Race matters, and we need to call it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, I'd like to follow some of the very practical efforts thatBarack Obama, President Obama, put into place when he had hisJustice Department going after the police departments that wereviolating the rights of young black men and women across thiscountry.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I know there's much to criticize this administration about, butthe very fact that the Justice Department under President Obama hadworked with police departments around the country -- and they were-- they were not finished, but had worked with, and some had alreadyreached the point of signing consent decrees, of starting newtraining, of trying to put themselves on a better path.</p><p>There are many good people in law enforcement who want this towork and want to make it work if they have the right resources, ifthey have the right opportunities, if they can do communitypolicing. That's where President Obama was leading us, and thisadministration pulled that out of the Justice Department, reversedit, and that makes the world a lot more dangerous for everyone. Iwould reverse that and go where President Obama went. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Mary Crump. She's a retired nursefrom Jackson. Mary?</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren, for being here. How do youplan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes?</p><p>WARREN:  Whoa!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, look, we need big structural change in this country. Andthat means the kind of -- let's just admit it. When you've got agovernment that works for the rich and it's not working nearly aswell for anyone else, that's corruption, and we need to call it outplain and simple.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So the first thing we need to do is we need to attack thatcorruption head on. I have the biggest anti-corruption bill sinceWatergate. Big problem, you got to have a big bill to deal with it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, it's got a lot of pieces to it, but the main point is tobeat back on the influence of money, because that's how they keepgetting this government, getting this country to work for them. So,for example, my bill says we're going to end lobbying as we know it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Lock the revolving door between Main Street -- between WallStreet and Washington.</p><p>I'll give you one more. Everyone who runs for federal officeought to have to put their taxes online, everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, part one, we got to deal with the corruption head on. Butlet me give you a part two. I was talking earlier about we got torewrite the rules in this economy. And part of that is putting morepower back in the hands of workers. Unions, that's one way to do it.I've got an accountable capitalism bill that says, on the bigFortune 500 companies, that we're going to have employees also siton the board of directors and help make decisions.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But there's one more we've got to talk about, and that is myultra-millionaires tax. So the idea is, on the truly great fortunes,$50 million and above, we start charging 2 percent a year on justthat $50 millionth and first dollar and on up, 2 percent a year.</p><p>And by the way, anybody in here a homeowner?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You've been paying wealth taxes for a long time. They're justcalled property taxes. I just want to include the Rembrandt and thediamonds in the property taxes. So...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I'm going to put a wealth tax in place. And I just want totalk to you for one minute about how that restructures our wholeeconomy. We get a 2 percent tax on the 75,000 richest families inthis country, we would have enough money to provide universalchildcare, universal Pre-K, universal Pre-Pre-K for every child inAmerica, and still have $2 trillion left over. Let's make it happen.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democraticpresidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campusof Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.</p><p>I want to bring in Marcy Croft, she is a lawyer from Madison,Mississippi. Marcy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Marcy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. Hi, Senator. You have proposed breaking up thebig tech companies.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  Is it really possible to increase regulation ofprivate tech companies without stifling innovation?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good question, Marcy. But here's my point. If youbreak them up, you actually need less regulation. Because here's howthis works right now. Think about the big tech companies -- Amazon,Facebook, Google, right?</p><p>Here's what they do. They run a platform, OK, where people come-- let's just stick with Amazon. That's where you go to check out 63coffee makers, all of which can be delivered in 24 hours, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And think about this, just so you get an idea of how vast theyare right now in our economy. Walmart is about 9 percent of allphysical retail sales in America. Amazon, 49 percent of all online.So this is a big deal. If you want to sell online, you're a littleguy, you're trying to get your business started, you're anentrepreneur, you've got to be there.</p><p>So Amazon runs this platform. You come to the platform. Allsounds great. But Amazon also is collecting information on everysingle buyer who visits and on every single seller who's there, andon every single transaction. And what it does is it has the capacityto look out there and see, you know, Pete's pet pillows, and say,whoa, Pete had a good idea here. He's making money off this. Sohere's what we're going to do. We're going to take Pete off pageone, move him back to page 16, where nobody goes, and then AmazonPete Pet Pillows is going to step right in front of him.</p><p>You know, think of it this way like in baseball. You can be anumpire, run the platform, or you can have a team in the game, runone of the businesses competing with the other businesses. But youdon't get to do both at the same time.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So here's my pitch. I just want to break those two thingsapart. I want you still to be able to go and check out all thecoffeemakers you want to check out. The platform works. But nobodygets to suck a lot of information off the platform for the purposeof being able to put a bunch of little businesses out of business.</p><p>We want to have more competition in America, break up thosetech giants. We can make that work.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rodney Smith. He's a lawnmaintenance contractor here in Jackson. Rodney?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Rodney.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening. The cities of America have crumblinginfrastructure. How would you combat these issues? These areproblems that everyone knows about but have failed to do anythingabout these problems.</p><p>WARREN:  Right. All right, it's a good question. So, look, thinkof infrastructure this way. I kind of think of it like a farmerplows the fields. We get out there together through our government,and we build the roads and the bridges, we put up the communicationssystem, we do these things together because you can't start a littlebusiness and at the same time try to build the road in front of yourhouse, right? So you need all these pieces to make it work. A farmerwho does a good job of planting the fields, it means a lot of seedsget to grow and to go forward.</p><p>Now, what's happened in America is that we've cut back onmaking those infrastructure investments. And you all see it everyday. You see it in your lives. You see it when you see roads thatare crumbling, bridges that are dangerous. Yeah, you're all seeingthis, right?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So understand, it's worse than what you see, because Americacompetes all around the world now. That's just the reality. Andright now, here in America, we are spending about 0.6 percent, justa smidge, on our infrastructure. In fact, some people say it's noteven enough to replace what's breaking and falling apart. China, bycomparison, is spending about 5 percent of its GDP oninfrastructure. It is spending eight times more, almost nine timesmore on its infrastructure.</p><p>It's building a future for those small businesses, for thosemedium-sized businesses, for those giant businesses. It is buildinga future for work in China. We need to step up our investment ininfrastructure right here in the United States of America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's how we build a future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll add one little piece to it and say, when you take alook at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building theinfrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Maggie Spitz. She works at a publiclibrary in Madison, Mississippi. Maggie?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  Presently the state of Mississippi imposes a specialtax on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles as a penalty forpaying less in gas taxes. Do you believe this is the right approach,considering the warnings about climate change? And what would youpropose to encourage the increased use of alternative energy?</p><p>WARREN:  OK. So, can we just start with the issue of climatechange? And I want to say something that is very controversial. So,most of you are sitting down. Maggie, is it? You may want to sitdown, too, OK, or just hold on to a chair. Because I spend time inWashington. In Washington, this is a very controversial statement:  Ibelieve in science.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Climate change is real, it is manmade, and we are running outof runway to be able to fix this problem.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need all hands on deck on this one. So I mentioned earlier,as part of infrastructure, we need to be thinking aboutinfrastructure in terms of hardening our infrastructure against theclimate change that's coming our way and in terms of building greenenergy infrastructure.</p><p>We need to do more, though. We've got to be working in everysingle direction. More money on research. More money on how we getour vehicles so that we get to a place where we have a sustainableEarth. This is truly the crisis that faces not just our nation, butthe world.</p><p>The United States is a world leader. The problem is we areleading in the wrong direction right now on climate.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We've got to go the other way. We've got to show the world whatcan be done. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I just want to follow up on Maggie's question,because she talked about the gas tax. As you know, the federal gastax has not been raised...</p><p>WARREN:  I know.</p><p>TAPPER:  ... since 1993, leaving many states to fend forthemselves to maintain the roads and bridges. Would you support,theoretically, raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructureneeds?</p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, I'll tell you what worries about doingthis through gas tax. I'm open to the conversation, but what worriesme is it falls hardest on working people. When I talk about raisingtaxes, what I really want to see is I want to see anultra-millionaire's tax.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I want to see taxes on the top. And then let's use that to helpsubsidize what it is that we really want to see:  Cleaner vehicles.That's the direction I'd much rather see us go. I want to get usthere, but I want to do it the other way.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Ally Mack, a longtimeJackson resident, who served as the dean of international studieshere at Jackson State University. Dean Mack?</p><p>QUESTION:  What is your position on the impeachment of DonaldTrump?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So, we have a report that is due from the specialprosecutor any day now. Understand that that investigation from Mr.Mueller has produced already -- I believe it's 34 indictments orguilty pleas. This is a serious investigation. We need to protecthim in finishing that report. And then that report needs to be madepublic to the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>When we get it, we will know what to do with it. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator Warren, you sit on the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee.</p><p>WARREN:  I do.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to introduce you to Daniel Bamrick. He's a U.S.Army veteran who served in Kuwait and Syria who is now a researchlab technician. Daniel?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Daniel.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hey, Senator. Good evening.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi. Thank you for your service.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Your family, too. Big brothers.</p><p>WARREN:  All right. Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION:  As a veteran, I've seen the amazing capability of ourarmed forces.</p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION:  But I was also shocked to see the lack of clearlydefined goals and objectives coming down from the highest level. Italso worries me that military service itself is becoming a veryuncommon experience...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... for the U.S. population at large. So, aspresident, my question is, what would you do to provide clear,achievable goals for our military and to broaden the participationrate of American citizens in what is their government's largestorganization?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you for the question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Look, with three brothers in the military, my oldestone spent more than five years off and on in combat in Vietnam. Wewere lucky to get him back home. And my second brother was overseasfor over a year. My third brother trained as an Army medic. Iunderstand the sacrifices that our military makes and the sacrificestheir families make. I stood there every day and watched my motheras she waited for the mail to hear from my brothers.</p><p>We have the best military on Earth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>They will do whatever we ask them to do. They will go out andfight and, if necessary, die for us. But that puts a sacredresponsibility on our leadership to understand that, around theworld, we cannot use our military to solve non-military problems.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to be willing to use all of the tools in the toolbox,and that means we need to be using our diplomatic tools muchstronger. We need to use our economic tools. And we need, when we dofeel absolutely pressed to use a military alternative, we need to beclear not just on what our objective is going in, what the measureis of success, but what our plan is to get out on the other side.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We cannot fight endless wars. It's wrong.</p><p>TAPPER:  So, Daniel worked in Syria. He served in Syria. You'vesaid it's, quote, \"right to get our troops out of Syria,\" but youdid criticize President Trump for failing to plan the withdrawal...</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  ... with U.S. allies. The U.S. is currently planning toleave 400 or more servicemembers in Syria on what is being called apeacekeeping mission. Would you as president keep any troops on theground in Syria? And if so, how many?</p><p>WARREN:  I think we need to get out. We need to get out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Until someone can identify -- and this is the whole point aboutit. I ask this in hearings in Armed Services. What is the measure ofsuccess? If you're going to be there, describe, let us see so we cantell if you're failing or succeeding at this. And no one can come upwith an answer. And until they can do that, we need our troops backhome.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Jayda Lee, a public health educatorfrom Jackson. Jada?</p><p>WARREN:  Hello, hi, Jayda.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. Good evening. Mississippi has one of the highestmaternal mortality rates in the nation. Black and brown women makeup the majority of those who fall victim to higher rates ofpregnancy-related mortality.</p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION:  Although some of this disparity can be attributed tolack of access, other issues are less easily explained. How wouldyou administration create legislation to improve outcomes for thesewomen?</p><p>WARREN:  So, it is an excellent question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let me tell you something I've already been working on in thisarea. This is a place where we need not only more funding for theNational Institutes of Health to be able to do the research, but weneed to insist that the National Institutes of Health is actuallydoing research and keeping track of male/female, AfricanAmerican/other races, so that we better understand all of what'swrong.</p><p>As you say, we know that part of this is related to lack ofaccess, but that's not explaining everything that's going on. Ibelieve in research. And we've got to support it so that it supportsall of our mamas and all of our babies. It's very important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I want to bring in Michael Barber. He's afreshman here at Jackson State University. He says he's currentlysupporting Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run. Michael?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Michael.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, ma'am. Yeah, my question is we haveseen recently kids who have the luxury of parents paying their wayinto school no matter the GPA. The kids who attend inner cityschools do not have that luxury or the resources to excel and theysuffer greatly as they become closer to adult life. How would younot only improve, but make the educational system fair for allAmerican people?</p><p>WARREN:  All right. So, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, this scandal just shows one more time that some folkswho are rich just think they don't have to play by the same set ofrules as anyone else and that they can use their money to dowhatever it is in terms of buying influence. We have to put a stopto that.</p><p>And it's not just -- it's everywhere now. And we're heretalking about a presidential primary. It's everywhere in Washington.You know, I just -- I want to say something about democracy for aminute. I get that we have a lot of differences. There will be somepeople who have a little more money, some people who have a littleless, some people who go further in school, some people who don't.But the one thing we should all own an equal share of is an equalshare of our democracy.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need a government that doesn't just listen to the rich andthe powerful, but a government that listens to all of us. And thatstarts right now in a Democratic primary. Something you can askeveryone in the Democratic primary who wants to ask for your vote isto ask them where they've been and how they've gotten their funding.</p><p>Me, I don't take corporate PAC money. In fact, I don't take PACmoney of any kind.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't take federal lobbyists' money. And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I don't go behind closed doors with people of money andinfluence to try to get their help in this election. I come here tobe with you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Because I believe that our democracy is really on the ropes. Wehave a country that's working better and better and better for athinner and thinner slice at the top. In 2020, we have a chance totake that back. We have a chance to build a real grassrootsfoundation, face to face, person to person, neighborhood toneighborhood.</p><p>And if you believe that is how we should be running ourpresidential primary, I ask you, be part of this. Go toelizabethwarren.com. Be part of this. Make a contribution,volunteer. We're going to have to build this thing ourselves,because democracy is not a machine that will go of itself.</p><p>And government, our government, is not for sale. We need agovernment that works for the people, and that means the people haveto be there as part of it. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I have one final question for you, Senator. Faith isvery important to many people across the country. It's veryimportant to many people in Mississippi. What role does faith playin your life, your public life and your private life?</p><p>WARREN:  So I was raised as a Methodist, and...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I was a fifth grade Sunday school teacher. All I can say is,nobody got hurt.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It was a low bar for being a fifth grade Sunday school teacherat our church. And I raised my children in the Methodist church.What it is for me is the importance of the lessons we learn when weremember our values, when we remember our faith.</p><p>The story for me is Matthew 26, and I'm sure some of you -- alot of you know this story. You know, this is the one where theshepherd is dividing the world into the sheep and the goats. And aswe all know, sheep are going to heaven, goats, nah, they're not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And the sheep ask him, why us? Why us, Lord? Why did you pickus? We look like those -- like those guys. And the shepherd, theLord, answers back by saying, \"I was hungry, and you gave me food. Iwas thirsty, and you gave me water. I was in prison, and you visitedme, naked and ye clothed me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one ofthese, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.\"</p><p>And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day.The first is there is God, there is value in every single humanbeing.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every single human being. And the second is that we are calledto action.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That passage is not about you had a good thought and held ontoit, you sat back and were just a part of -- you know, thought aboutgood things. It does not say, you just didn't hurt anybody andthat's good enough. No.</p><p>It says, you saw something wrong, you saw somebody who wasthirsty, you saw somebody who was in prison.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You saw their face.

ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[*]     TAPPER:  Good evening from Jackson, Mississippi, and welcome toa CNN Democratic presidential candidate town hall with SenatorElizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. I'm Jake Tapper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(APPLAUSE)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are live at Jackson State University, a historically blackuniversity founded in 1877 for the first major Democratic 2020 eventin the state of Mississippi. We're here with Senator Warren, aformer special needs teacher and law professor who made her namefighting the big banks. If elected, she would make history as thefirst female president of the United States of America.</p><p>Tonight, Senator Warren will take questions from Democrats andindependents who say they plan to participate in the Democraticprimaries and caucuses. Please welcome Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Hey, Jake.</p><p>TAPPER:  How are you? Good to see you.</p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Have a seat.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, this is fun.</p><p>TAPPER:  So before we begin, you're a former law professor. Feelgood to be back on a campus?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, it always feels good to be back on a campus.Absolutely.</p><p>TAPPER:  Which is more fun, teaching law students, teaching on acampus, or working with senators in the U.S. Senate?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, teaching. Are you kidding?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>Much more fun.</p><p>TAPPER:  I thought you might give that answer.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let's start with our first town hall question. Thefirst one comes from Christopher Lane. He's a doctoral candidate inpublic health here at Jackson State University. Christopher?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator Warren. My question is,Mississippi is a deeply red state and one of the poorest states inthe country, yet many white poor and working-class citizens continueto vote against their economic interests. What message, if any, doyou have that may resonate with them that may encourage them to votefor you?</p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you for the question, Christopher. Look, thisis how I see it. Washington is working great, it's workingfabulously for giant drug companies. It's just not working forpeople who are trying to get a prescription filled.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for big oil companies that want to drilleverywhere. It's just not working for people who see climate changebearing down upon us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's working great for giant financial institutions and forpayday lenders. It's just not working great for people who areliving paycheck to paycheck.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I'm tired of a Washington that works for the rich and thepowerful. I want a Washington that works for the rest of America.That's why I'm in this fight.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I believe on that, that Democrats, independents, andRepublicans, they know a scam when they see it. And they see aWashington working for those guys. I think they're ready to get inthe fight and get a Washington and a country that works for the restof America. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  So our next -- our next questioner is Khalita Hicks.She's a supporter of yours and a Spanish language translator fromJackson. Khalita?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Khalita.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening. Since the election of Donald Trump, thenumber of hate crimes has increased and white supremacists havebecome more emboldened online and in public. What are your plans tounite the country?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good. Thank you for that question. You know, itstarts with the fact that we've got to recognize the threat posed bywhite nationalism. White supremacists pose a threat to the UnitedStates like any other terrorist group, like ISIS, like Al Qaida.</p><p>And leadership starts at the top. And that means you've got tocall it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No sitting by. And then when you call it out, as president ofthe United States, you've got to use the tools available to you. Andthat means get the Justice Department when they break the law to goafter them with full prosecution. That's what I can do. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you. Good question.</p><p>TAPPER:  Our next question comes from Georgia Cohran. She's agraduate student here at Jackson State University. Georgia?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you, Senator Warren, for taking myquestion.</p><p>TAPPER:  Got to hold the mike up there.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you so much for taking my question. I am anAfrican-American female with -- I'm an African-American female withfive beautiful adult children and 10 grandchildren.</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Georgia, count your blessings every day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION:  Please, please, describe to me what a public apologyto -- for 400 years of free labor...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... in the South, especially Mississippi, will looklike in the African American community in the new election.</p><p>WARREN:  All right, thank you, Georgia.</p><p>QUESTION:  In the new administration.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, America was founded on principles of liberty and freedom,and on the backs of slave labor. This is a stain on America, andwe're not going to fix that, we're not going to change that until weaddress it head on, directly.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And make no mistake:  It's not just the original founding. It'swhat's happened generation after generation. The impact ofdiscrimination handed down from one to the next means that today inAmerica, because of housing discrimination, because of employmentdiscrimination, we live in a world where for the average whitefamily has $100, the average black family has about $5.</p><p>So I believe it's time to start the national full-blownconversation about reparations in this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that means I support the bill in the House to appoint acongressional panel of experts, of people who are studying this, whotalk about different ways we may be able to do it, and to make areport back to Congress so that we can as a nation do what's rightand begin to heal. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, if I could just follow up on -- if I couldjust follow up on Georgia's question, you've said you're open to aconversation about reparations to the descendants of slaves and alsoto Native Americans, you also said. Might that include directpayments, direct financial transfer of money?</p><p>WARREN:  So there are a lot of ways to think about howreparations should be formed. And I noticed, Georgia's questionactually started with just the frame of an apology, right, with theframe of a national recognition.</p><p>We have a lot of experts around the country, a lot of activistswho have a whole lot of different approaches to it. And I think thebest we can do right now -- I love the idea of this congressionalcommission. Let's bring people together and let's open thatconversation as Americans. Let's see what ideas people want to puton the table, and let's talk them through, because I got to tellyou, ignoring the problem is not working.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Jay Kucia. He's a supporter of yours,as well. He's a student who founded a labor rights group at theUniversity of Mississippi Law School. That's in Oxford, I believe.</p><p>WARREN:  Right.</p><p>TAPPER:  He has a question about Medicare for all. Jay?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>QUESTION:  Senator Warren, thank you so much for being here thisevening and your tireless advocacy for universal health care. As asupporter of universal health care and an advocate for organizedlabor, I do worry about the current bills' elimination of privatehealth insurance...</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... that would eliminate the private healthemployer-based plans that so many unions have advocated for. Can youexplain how Medicare for all would be better for workers than simplyimproving the Affordable Care Act?</p><p>WARREN:  OK, so it's a good question. Let's start with ourstatement that we should make every time we start to talk aboutchanges in our health care, and that is health care is a basic humanright and we fight for basic human rights.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then let's put these in order, because I appreciate thatyour question starts with the Affordable Care Act. Let's allremember when we're talking about what's possible, let's start wherewe are and the difference between Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>Right now, Democrats are trying to figure out how to expandhealth care coverage at the lowest possible cost so everybody iscovered. Republicans right this minute are out there trying torepeal the Affordable Care Act. They've got a lawsuit pending downin Texas where they're trying to roll it back. What they couldn't dowith a vote, they're trying to do with the courts. HHS every day isdoing what they can to undermine the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>So when we're talking about health care in America right now,the first thing we need to be talking about is defend the AffordableCare Act, protection under the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Then part two. Let's make the improvements that are what Ithink of as low-hanging fruit. For example, let's bring down thecost of prescription drugs all across this country.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We got lots of ways we can do that. We can import drugs fromCanada where the safety standards are the same. That would cut costsdramatically. We can negotiate the prices under Medicare. That wouldcut costs dramatically.</p><p>And I've got a proposal to help bring down the cost on genericdrugs, which could be about 90 percent of all prescriptions. Solet's get those costs down.</p><p>And then you know what you're going to hear from a consumeradvocate, and that is we need to hold insurance companiesaccountable. And that means no tricking and trapping people on thoseinsurance contracts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then when we talk about Medicare for all, there are a lotof different pathways. What we're all looking for is the lowest costway to make sure everybody gets covered. And some folks are talkingabout let's start lowering the age, maybe bring it down to 60, 55,50. That helps cover people who are most at risk and can be helpful,for example, to the labor's plans.</p><p>Some people say, do it the other way. Let's bring it up from --everybody under 30 gets covered by Medicare. Others say letemployees be able to buy into the Medicare plans. Others say let'slet employees buy into the Medicare plans.</p><p>For me, what's key is we get everybody at the table on this,that labor is at the table, that people who have to buy on theirown, everybody comes to the table together. And we figure out how todo Medicare for all in a way that makes sure that we're going to get100 percent coverage in this country at the lowest possible cost foreveryone. That's our job.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You like that?</p><p>TAPPER:  If I could just follow up a little on Jay's question,so you are a co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders' Medicare for allbill, and I understand there are a lot of different paths touniversal coverage, but his bill that you've co-sponsored wouldessentially eliminate private insurance. Is that something you couldsupport?</p><p>WARREN:  He's got a runway for that. I think we get everybodytogether. And that's what it is, we'll decide. I've alsoco-sponsored other bills, including expanding Medicaid as anotherapproach that we use. But what's really important to me about thisis we never lose sight of what the center is, because the center isabout making sure that every single person in this country gets thecoverage they need and that it's at a price that they can afford. Westart with our values, we'll get to the right place.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, theoretically, though, there could be a role forprivate insurance companies under President Warren?</p><p>WARREN:  There could. Or there could be a temporary role. EvenBernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's --look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure thatwe land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. Everybody has got tostay covered. It's critical.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Kari Johnson. She's a high schoolprincipal in Canton, Mississippi. Kari?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kari.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello, Senator Warren, and thank you for coming.</p><p>WARREN:  I'm glad to be here.</p><p>QUESTION:  Obviously, building a wall will not preventforeigners from crossing on U.S. land.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  What will you do -- what will you put in place tocontrol the influx of migrants?</p><p>WARREN:  OK. So let me just start where I think of our wholeimmigration policy, and that is, we need to have policies onimmigration that are consistent with our values.</p><p>We are a country that is built on our differences. That is ourstrength, not our weakness. And when people come to the UnitedStates because they are fleeing terror in Central America, they fearfor their lives, then we have a moral responsibility to listen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... and to be there. You know, if I can just take a minute tosay on this one, I went down to the border last year when the wordfirst began to come out about children taken away from theirmothers. And I just want you all to envision this.</p><p>Think of a big, old Amazon warehouse, only dirty and smelledbad. And when I walked in on my left were cages, maybe 10 feet wide,40 feet deep, a toilet back in the corner, one after another afteranother crammed full of men. On the right, one after another afteranother crammed full of women. And then you walk into the main area,and there were cages about the size of this central area here withnothing but little girls in it. And over there, nothing but littleboys.</p><p>That's not who we are. That is not the country we want to be.And an immigration system that is administered so that it is notable to tell the difference between a criminal, a terrorist, and a12-year-old little girl is an immigration system that not only isnot keeping us safer, it does not reflect our values.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I will not support the building of a wall that does not make ussafer. The administration itself, people within it, have alreadysaid this is not about security, this is not how we're going to makeourselves safer. The kind of wall that is proposed now is a monumentto hate and division. We are a better country than that. So, I'lljust stop there. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  So, Senator, just to follow up, so Kari's specificquestion was what will you put in place to control the influx ofmigrants.</p><p>WARREN:  So -- I should hit both of those. You're exactly right.One thing we can do is remember all the tools in the toolbox. Andthat is, when there's a problem in Central America, because thegangs have taken over, because the local officials can't manage,then that's not a point at which we should be cutting our aid.</p><p>If we want to stop the problem of mamas fleeing for theirlives, then let's make a little more investment in the areas thatare troubled. And let's help people be able to stay where they aresafely.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's a much kinder way to do it.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Paul Buckley. He's a high schoolhistory teacher from Jackson. Paul?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, how are you, Paul?</p><p>QUESTION:  Doing well. Good evening. Welcome to Mississippi.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION:  So, Senator, conservatives are increasingly using thesocialist label as a means of attack. So how and to what degree withyour policies encourage the traditional value of self-reliance,offering financially challenged Americans a hand up, but not ahandout?</p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, this one really -- this is just areminder that folks can say whatever they want, but the reality is,at least for me, I believe in markets and I believe in the valuethat we get out of markets. But it's got to be markets with rules.You know, market without rules is theft.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But a market with rules, a market with rules, a market with acop on the beat to enforce those rules, that's how it is that smallbusinesses get a chance to start and to grow. That's how it is thatemployees get to move from one place to another. That's how it isthat we get new products. I'm a supporter of markets with rules.</p><p>And what's wrong right now in Washington is the big folks, theydon't want rules.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>These giant corporations, they just want to be able to run overwhoever they want to run over. And if that means run over their ownemployees, then, by golly, they'll do it. If that means run overtheir customers, by golly, they'll do it. If that means running overtheir local communities, by golly, they will do it.</p><p>So the way I see this is we not only need a government that'son our side with these rules. We need big, systemic change. And thatmeans we need more balance out there in the marketplace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you, real quick, a couple of ways we can do that.The first one is, we need for employees to have more power, and thatmeans we need to make it easier to join a union and unions need tohave more power once people have joined.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Unions built America's middle class. Unions will rebuildAmerica's middle class. That's how we make it happen. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  And we should note, you're here in Mississippi, you'refocusing on housing for people who are struggling. You have a planto try to tackle that. You say it's going to help lower rent. Howdoes that work?</p><p>does that work?</p><p>WARREN:  So I have a proposal to build about 3 million newhousing units across America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I just want to stop for a second. Anybody in here worryabout the rise price of housing? Right? Yeah, that's pretty mucheverybody, right?</p><p>The idea is that we need to make a real investment in housing.In the same way that we think about health care as a basic humanright, having a decent and safe place to live should be a basichuman right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And the squeeze is everywhere. It's the poor, it's the workingpoor, it's the working class, it's the middle class, shoot, it evenkind of moves up into the upper middle class, that people feelsqueezed on housing, because we just don't have enough affordablehousing across this country.</p><p>So I believe what we should do is we should make a biginvestment in housing. And by the way, if we do that, independentanalysis from Moody's says that we would lower rents across thiscountry by about 10 percent -- that's across the board -- and we'dcreate an opportunity for more people to become buyers.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So housing is important. And if I can, Jake, I want to tell youabout one other part of this. This bill also addresses theblack-white gap in housing that comes from generation aftergeneration, not just a passive discrimination, but realize that intothe 1960s in America, the federal government was subsidizing thepurchase of homes for white families and discriminating againstblack families. That's red-lining.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>This bill tackles that head on. And it says for people who areliving in formally red-lined areas, there's going to be specialassistance for first-time homebuyers, for people who got cheated inthe run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, some specialassistance for folks to be able to get that first home and to startbuilding the generation after generation of wealth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's a step in the right direction.</p><p>TAPPER:  We're going to take a very quick break. We'll be rightback with more from CNN's Democratic presidential candidate townhall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live in Jackson,Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campusof Jackson State University.</p><p>We're going to go to the questioners in a second, but before wedo, I do want to ask a little bit about your personal story, becausevoters nationwide are just getting to know you. You grew up inOklahoma.</p><p>WARREN:  I did.</p><p>TAPPER:  And you've talked about how your family stood at thebrink...</p><p>WARREN:  There's one.</p><p>TAPPER:  One person from Oklahoma.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WARREN:  There we go.</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome to Mississippi. So you talked about how yourfamily stood at the brink of financial disaster through a good partof your childhood. How has that shaped your life in the Senate?</p><p>WARREN:  So, I'll tell you about that. So I have three olderbrothers. They all went off and joined the military. That was theirticket to America's middle class.</p><p>I was the late-in-life baby. My mother always just called me\"the surprise.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And about the time I was in middle school, my daddy had a heartattack, and it was serious. Thought he was going to die. The churchneighbors brought covered dishes. It was a scary time.</p><p>He survived, but he couldn't go back to work. And we lost ourfamily's station wagon. And at night, I'd hear my parents talk, andthat's where I learned words like \"mortgage\" and \"foreclosure.\" AndI remember the day that I walked into my parents' bedroom and layingout on the bed is the dress.</p><p>And some people here will know the dress. It's the one thatonly comes out for weddings, funerals, and graduations. And mymother is in her slip, and she's stocking feet, and she's pacingback and forth, and she's crying. She's saying, \"We will not losethis house. We will not lose this house.\" She was 50 years old. Shehad never worked outside the home. She was truly terrified.</p><p>And I watched her while she finally just pulled it together,put that dress on, put on her high heels, blew her nose, and walkedto the Sears and got a minimum wage job. And that minimum wage jobsaved our house, but more importantly, it saved our family.</p><p>Anybody who wants to know me has just heard this story. Buthere's the thing for me now. For a long time, I used to think thatwas just a story about my mother, how when you get scared, you reachdown and you find what you have to find and you bring it up.</p><p>And then, years later, I came to understand this is a storyabout millions of Americans, who -- it doesn't matter if you'rescared. When you got to do something to take care of people youlove, you reach down, you find it, and you pull it up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And then it was years later that I came to understand it wasalso a story about government, because when this happened to myfamily, the minimum wage in America would support a family of three.It would take care of a mortgage, utilities, and put food on thetable.</p><p>Today in America, a full-time minimum-wage job will not keep amama and a baby out of poverty. I am in this fight...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... because I believe that is wrong.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, it's -- for me, there's the whole story of why I'm inthis fight. Washington once asked the question, at least on minimumwage, what does it take to support a family, to get a little toe inthe door? Today, I hear them in Washington. They ask, what willimprove the profitability of giant multinational banks?</p><p>Well, I want a government that doesn't work for giantmultinational corporations. I want one that works for littlefamilies like mine.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Latoya Hubbard. She works for adefense contracting firm here in Mississippi. Latoya?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Latoya.</p><p>QUESTION:  Do you have any plans of relieving federally funded,overwhelming student loan debt burdens, in that many middle-classand poor individuals obtained those loans to create a better future,but are having issues doing that?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, Latoya, the answer is yes. I have got plans toreduce student loan debt. Let me just start there.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But, you know, there are parts of this that are so personal.I've had one dream since I was in second grade. There's just onething I wanted to be. All three of my brothers went off and joinedthe military, and God bless them. Do you know what I wanted to be? Iwanted to be a public schoolteacher from the time I was in secondgrade. Can we hear it for America's public schoolteachers? Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But you've got to have a four-year diploma to do that. And bythe time I graduated high school, my family didn't have the moneyfor a college application, much less to send me off to school. And Ihave a long and twisty story, got a scholarship, then I fell inlove...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>... got married, the first time.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And I thought I'd lost it all. I thought I was -- I thought Ihad given up on that dream. And I found a commuter college, publiccollege, that cost $50 a semester. And that was my ticket. And Ibecame a special needs teacher. I got to live my dream.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So let me just say, I believe in what we can do througheducation. But if America wants to be a stronger country, Americawants to be a country of real opportunity for everyone, then thatmeans that every kid has a right to get an education without gettingcrushed by student loan debt, period.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  While we're on the subject -- while we're on thesubject of education, our next question has to do with the placewe're standing in right now, a historically black university.</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Kathy Johnson. She works in bankingin Ridgeland, Mississippi. Kathy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Kathy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren. Being a graduate of ahistorically black college and university, I see firsthand how weare the first to lose funding or to have budget cuts.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  How would you make it a priority that we receive morefunding and being able to compete with non-historically blackcolleges and universities?</p><p>WARREN:  All right. So, great question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I believe in HBCUs. I just want to say, I am the proudrecipient of a diploma that was granted to me at Morgan StateUniversity, so...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>As part of their commencement address. So, let me put it thisway. What we've got to do is we've got to be willing to invest morein our colleges and universities across the board. We have got tobring down the cost of an education.</p><p>of an education.</p><p>And for the schools that are serving the students who oftencome from -- first time to come to college, from families thatstruggle more, then that means we've got to double down and doubledown a second time to make sure they have the resources they need.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And it's not enough just for somebody to stand here and talkabout it generally. I want you to know, I get this one. Right now,in America, African American students are more likely to have toborrow money to go to college. They're more likely to borrow moremoney. And they are more likely to have trouble paying off that debtwhen they leave college. That is a national disgrace.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And part of dealing with our student loan debt burden needs tofocus on that specifically. So, thank you. It's a good question.Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Brennan Breeland. He's a lawyer andan officer in the Army Reserves. Brennan?</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Senator.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Brennan.</p><p>QUESTION:  How do you respond to people who think that,regardless of the underlying facts, the way you handled the questionof your Native American heritage was tone-deaf, offensive, andindicative of a lack of presidential tact?</p><p>WARREN:  Well, you know, I grew up in Oklahoma. I learned aboutmy family from my family. And based on that, that's just kind of whoI am. And I do the best I can with it.</p><p>You know, there was an investigation. Nothing I ever did or myfamily played any role in any job I ever got.</p><p>But I'll tell you this. I have now done 38 town halls inMassachusetts last year, and this is my 32nd town hall sinceJanuary. And what I've discovered is that people care a lot aboutwhat's happening to their lives every single day and what touchesthem, like housing and education and health care. That's the kind ofreason that I'm in this fight. And I'm going to stay in this fight.</p><p>And I'll tell you this. I'm going to fight it from the heartevery inch of the way. I'll do my best.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rukia Lumumba. She's alegal advocate and community organizer here in Jackson. She alsohappens to be the sister and former campaign manager of Jackson'scurrent mayor. Chokwe Antar Lumumba, her late father, ChokweLumumba, was also once the mayor of this city, as well. Rukia?</p><p>QUESTION:  All right. Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Good to see you.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Thank you for being here. Welcome toJackson, Mississippi. Yeah. So voter disenfranchisement is real. InMississippi, there are 23 felonies that once convicted ban a personfrom voting for the rest of their lives, literally limiting theircitizenship and right to democracy. Moreover, residents' access tovoting is limited by archaic voter registration processes andlimited voting formats. How will you expand voting rights to theformerly incarcerated, ensure online voter registration, andnon-excuse early voting?</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Great question. But can I go you one bigger?</p><p>QUESTION:  Yeah.</p><p>WARREN:  And that is, I believe we need a constitutionalamendment that protects the right to vote for every American citizenand to make sure that vote gets counted.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to put some federal muscle behind that. And we need torepeal every one of the voter suppression laws that is out thereright now.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll tell you one more. We need to make sure that everyvote counts. And, you know, I want to -- I want to push that righthere in Mississippi, because I think this is an important point. Youknow, come a general election, presidential candidates don't come toplaces like Mississippi.</p><p>QUESTION:  That's right.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah. They also don't come to places like Californiaand Massachusetts, right? Because we're not the \"battlegroundstates.\" Well, my view is that every vote matters. And the way wecan make that happen...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... is that we can have national voting. And that means get ridof the Electoral College and everybody counts.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Everybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to...</p><p>WARREN:  I think everybody ought to have to come and ask foryour vote. What do you think? Yeah.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Hannah Burnell Williams from here inJackson. She's hoping to go to graduate school. Hannah?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Senator Warren.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Hannah.</p><p>QUESTION:  Recently, many leaders in our nation have taken astance on whether or not Confederate symbols should remain in thepublic eye in many of our cities, towns, and parks. As apresidential hopeful, do you have any plans on addressing theremoval or lack thereof, of the reminders of this nation's dark pastor have any plans on preserving the nation's history in a way thatexplains it in a more educational sense versus showing praise to thelosing side?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  All right. You put it right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, I would support removing Confederate celebrations fromfederal lands and putting them in museums where they belong. That'sright. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me follow up, if I can, because Mississippi is theonly state in the country that still has the Confederate battleemblem on the state flag. Do you think Mississippi should adopt anew flag?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  That was the shortest answer I've ever gotten from apolitician in my life. We'll be right back with more from CNN'sDemocratic presidential candidate town hall with Senator ElizabethWarren. We're living in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>WARREN:  All right.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall. We're here with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We're live inJackson State University in Mississippi.</p><p>In 2018, Jackson, Mississippi, had it highest homicide rate inmore than 20 years, with 84 murders. According to local media, it'samong the highest murder rates in the country. On that topic, I wantto bring in Arreone Hill. She's an accountant for the office of thestate treasurer. Arreone?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. With Jackson, Mississippi, having a very highhomicide rate, will there be any revisions to gun control to helpensure less killings throughout the metropolitan city?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So here's how I look at this. Laws should reflect ourvalues. Laws are about our morals. And right now, across thiscountry, we lose on average seven children and teenagers everysingle day to gun violence. Just pause for a minute and think, if wewere losing seven children every single day to some mysteriousvirus, man, we'd be pulling out all the stops to say what can we doto change that, where's the medicine we need to develop, how can werespond, what do we need to do?</p><p>But instead, with gun violence, right now we don't do anything,not even the most sensible kinds of things, background checks...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>... at the federal level. No fly, no buy. Like if you're on theterrorist watch list, maybe you shouldn't be able to buy a gun.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That weapons of war do not belong on our streets.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>No bump stocks to make it easier to kill. No.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>There's so much that we could do to improve safety for ourchildren and for all of us, things that people agree with who aregun-owners and things that people agree with who are not gun-owners.And we have to do them at a federal level, because the problem is,even if you change your laws right here in Mississippi, if theydon't change their laws in the other states, if they still have thegun show loopholes, somebody can just go there, put it in the backof a pickup, and come on down.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So this is a national problem. It goes back to the questionI've been talking about, who does government work for? Right now, itworks for the wealthy and the well-connected, and that means we havea federal government being held hostage by the NRA. I believe we canfight back and we can change that together.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, let me bring in Samantha Manning. She workshere at Jackson State University as an administrative assistant inthe Disabilities Services Department. Samantha?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Samantha.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello. As a mother of black boys, I am constantlyreminded of a judicial system where the scales are often weighedagainst them, and those that have sworn to protect them, fear them,and are most often ruled justified in excessive actions againstother children who look like them. As president, how would youaddress the concerns that I and many other parents like me have whenit comes to protecting our children and restoring our faith in thejudicial system?</p><p>WARREN:  So, thank you very much.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I start with the principle, the four words carved above theUnited States Supreme Court, \"Equal justice under law.\" That's whatI believe in.</p><p>But I understand today in America we don't have that.</p><p>QUESTION:  Right.</p><p>WARREN:  That's right. Race matters, and we need to call it out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, I'd like to follow some of the very practical efforts thatBarack Obama, President Obama, put into place when he had hisJustice Department going after the police departments that wereviolating the rights of young black men and women across thiscountry.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I know there's much to criticize this administration about, butthe very fact that the Justice Department under President Obama hadworked with police departments around the country -- and they were-- they were not finished, but had worked with, and some had alreadyreached the point of signing consent decrees, of starting newtraining, of trying to put themselves on a better path.</p><p>There are many good people in law enforcement who want this towork and want to make it work if they have the right resources, ifthey have the right opportunities, if they can do communitypolicing. That's where President Obama was leading us, and thisadministration pulled that out of the Justice Department, reversedit, and that makes the world a lot more dangerous for everyone. Iwould reverse that and go where President Obama went. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Mary Crump. She's a retired nursefrom Jackson. Mary?</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you, Senator Warren, for being here. How do youplan to make sure the extremely rich pay their fair taxes?</p><p>WARREN:  Whoa!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, look, we need big structural change in this country. Andthat means the kind of -- let's just admit it. When you've got agovernment that works for the rich and it's not working nearly aswell for anyone else, that's corruption, and we need to call it outplain and simple.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So the first thing we need to do is we need to attack thatcorruption head on. I have the biggest anti-corruption bill sinceWatergate. Big problem, you got to have a big bill to deal with it.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Now, it's got a lot of pieces to it, but the main point is tobeat back on the influence of money, because that's how they keepgetting this government, getting this country to work for them. So,for example, my bill says we're going to end lobbying as we know it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Lock the revolving door between Main Street -- between WallStreet and Washington.</p><p>I'll give you one more. Everyone who runs for federal officeought to have to put their taxes online, everyone.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So, part one, we got to deal with the corruption head on. Butlet me give you a part two. I was talking earlier about we got torewrite the rules in this economy. And part of that is putting morepower back in the hands of workers. Unions, that's one way to do it.I've got an accountable capitalism bill that says, on the bigFortune 500 companies, that we're going to have employees also siton the board of directors and help make decisions.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But there's one more we've got to talk about, and that is myultra-millionaires tax. So the idea is, on the truly great fortunes,$50 million and above, we start charging 2 percent a year on justthat $50 millionth and first dollar and on up, 2 percent a year.</p><p>And by the way, anybody in here a homeowner?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You've been paying wealth taxes for a long time. They're justcalled property taxes. I just want to include the Rembrandt and thediamonds in the property taxes. So...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I'm going to put a wealth tax in place. And I just want totalk to you for one minute about how that restructures our wholeeconomy. We get a 2 percent tax on the 75,000 richest families inthis country, we would have enough money to provide universalchildcare, universal Pre-K, universal Pre-Pre-K for every child inAmerica, and still have $2 trillion left over. Let's make it happen.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  We'll be right back with more from CNN's Democraticpresidential candidate town hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren.We're live in Jackson, Mississippi. Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TAPPER:  Welcome back to CNN's Democratic presidential candidatetown hall with Senator Elizabeth Warren. We are live on the campusof Jackson State University in Jackson, Mississippi.</p><p>I want to bring in Marcy Croft, she is a lawyer from Madison,Mississippi. Marcy?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Marcy.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. Hi, Senator. You have proposed breaking up thebig tech companies.</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  Is it really possible to increase regulation ofprivate tech companies without stifling innovation?</p><p>WARREN:  Oh, good question, Marcy. But here's my point. If youbreak them up, you actually need less regulation. Because here's howthis works right now. Think about the big tech companies -- Amazon,Facebook, Google, right?</p><p>Here's what they do. They run a platform, OK, where people come-- let's just stick with Amazon. That's where you go to check out 63coffee makers, all of which can be delivered in 24 hours, right?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And think about this, just so you get an idea of how vast theyare right now in our economy. Walmart is about 9 percent of allphysical retail sales in America. Amazon, 49 percent of all online.So this is a big deal. If you want to sell online, you're a littleguy, you're trying to get your business started, you're anentrepreneur, you've got to be there.</p><p>So Amazon runs this platform. You come to the platform. Allsounds great. But Amazon also is collecting information on everysingle buyer who visits and on every single seller who's there, andon every single transaction. And what it does is it has the capacityto look out there and see, you know, Pete's pet pillows, and say,whoa, Pete had a good idea here. He's making money off this. Sohere's what we're going to do. We're going to take Pete off pageone, move him back to page 16, where nobody goes, and then AmazonPete Pet Pillows is going to step right in front of him.</p><p>You know, think of it this way like in baseball. You can be anumpire, run the platform, or you can have a team in the game, runone of the businesses competing with the other businesses. But youdon't get to do both at the same time.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So here's my pitch. I just want to break those two thingsapart. I want you still to be able to go and check out all thecoffeemakers you want to check out. The platform works. But nobodygets to suck a lot of information off the platform for the purposeof being able to put a bunch of little businesses out of business.</p><p>We want to have more competition in America, break up thosetech giants. We can make that work.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Rodney Smith. He's a lawnmaintenance contractor here in Jackson. Rodney?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Rodney.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening. The cities of America have crumblinginfrastructure. How would you combat these issues? These areproblems that everyone knows about but have failed to do anythingabout these problems.</p><p>WARREN:  Right. All right, it's a good question. So, look, thinkof infrastructure this way. I kind of think of it like a farmerplows the fields. We get out there together through our government,and we build the roads and the bridges, we put up the communicationssystem, we do these things together because you can't start a littlebusiness and at the same time try to build the road in front of yourhouse, right? So you need all these pieces to make it work. A farmerwho does a good job of planting the fields, it means a lot of seedsget to grow and to go forward.</p><p>Now, what's happened in America is that we've cut back onmaking those infrastructure investments. And you all see it everyday. You see it in your lives. You see it when you see roads thatare crumbling, bridges that are dangerous. Yeah, you're all seeingthis, right?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So understand, it's worse than what you see, because Americacompetes all around the world now. That's just the reality. Andright now, here in America, we are spending about 0.6 percent, justa smidge, on our infrastructure. In fact, some people say it's noteven enough to replace what's breaking and falling apart. China, bycomparison, is spending about 5 percent of its GDP oninfrastructure. It is spending eight times more, almost nine timesmore on its infrastructure.</p><p>It's building a future for those small businesses, for thosemedium-sized businesses, for those giant businesses. It is buildinga future for work in China. We need to step up our investment ininfrastructure right here in the United States of America.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That's how we build a future.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I'll add one little piece to it and say, when you take alook at the Green New Deal, understand this is about building theinfrastructure for the 21st century, for a sustainable world.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  Let me bring in Maggie Spitz. She works at a publiclibrary in Madison, Mississippi. Maggie?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  Presently the state of Mississippi imposes a specialtax on owners of electric and hybrid vehicles as a penalty forpaying less in gas taxes. Do you believe this is the right approach,considering the warnings about climate change? And what would youpropose to encourage the increased use of alternative energy?</p><p>WARREN:  OK. So, can we just start with the issue of climatechange? And I want to say something that is very controversial. So,most of you are sitting down. Maggie, is it? You may want to sitdown, too, OK, or just hold on to a chair. Because I spend time inWashington. In Washington, this is a very controversial statement:  Ibelieve in science.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Climate change is real, it is manmade, and we are running outof runway to be able to fix this problem.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need all hands on deck on this one. So I mentioned earlier,as part of infrastructure, we need to be thinking aboutinfrastructure in terms of hardening our infrastructure against theclimate change that's coming our way and in terms of building greenenergy infrastructure.</p><p>We need to do more, though. We've got to be working in everysingle direction. More money on research. More money on how we getour vehicles so that we get to a place where we have a sustainableEarth. This is truly the crisis that faces not just our nation, butthe world.</p><p>The United States is a world leader. The problem is we areleading in the wrong direction right now on climate.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We've got to go the other way. We've got to show the world whatcan be done. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I just want to follow up on Maggie's question,because she talked about the gas tax. As you know, the federal gastax has not been raised...</p><p>WARREN:  I know.</p><p>TAPPER:  ... since 1993, leaving many states to fend forthemselves to maintain the roads and bridges. Would you support,theoretically, raising the gas tax to pay for the infrastructureneeds?</p><p>WARREN:  So, you know, I'll tell you what worries about doingthis through gas tax. I'm open to the conversation, but what worriesme is it falls hardest on working people. When I talk about raisingtaxes, what I really want to see is I want to see anultra-millionaire's tax.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I want to see taxes on the top. And then let's use that to helpsubsidize what it is that we really want to see:  Cleaner vehicles.That's the direction I'd much rather see us go. I want to get usthere, but I want to do it the other way.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  The next question comes from Ally Mack, a longtimeJackson resident, who served as the dean of international studieshere at Jackson State University. Dean Mack?</p><p>QUESTION:  What is your position on the impeachment of DonaldTrump?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>WARREN:  So, we have a report that is due from the specialprosecutor any day now. Understand that that investigation from Mr.Mueller has produced already -- I believe it's 34 indictments orguilty pleas. This is a serious investigation. We need to protecthim in finishing that report. And then that report needs to be madepublic to the American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>When we get it, we will know what to do with it. Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator Warren, you sit on the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee.</p><p>WARREN:  I do.</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to introduce you to Daniel Bamrick. He's a U.S.Army veteran who served in Kuwait and Syria who is now a researchlab technician. Daniel?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Daniel.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hey, Senator. Good evening.</p><p>WARREN:  Hi. Thank you for your service.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you. Your family, too. Big brothers.</p><p>WARREN:  All right. Thank you.</p><p>QUESTION:  As a veteran, I've seen the amazing capability of ourarmed forces.</p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION:  But I was also shocked to see the lack of clearlydefined goals and objectives coming down from the highest level. Italso worries me that military service itself is becoming a veryuncommon experience...</p><p>WARREN:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  ... for the U.S. population at large. So, aspresident, my question is, what would you do to provide clear,achievable goals for our military and to broaden the participationrate of American citizens in what is their government's largestorganization?</p><p>WARREN:  Yes. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you for the question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>QUESTION:  Thank you.</p><p>WARREN:  Look, with three brothers in the military, my oldestone spent more than five years off and on in combat in Vietnam. Wewere lucky to get him back home. And my second brother was overseasfor over a year. My third brother trained as an Army medic. Iunderstand the sacrifices that our military makes and the sacrificestheir families make. I stood there every day and watched my motheras she waited for the mail to hear from my brothers.</p><p>We have the best military on Earth.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>They will do whatever we ask them to do. They will go out andfight and, if necessary, die for us. But that puts a sacredresponsibility on our leadership to understand that, around theworld, we cannot use our military to solve non-military problems.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need to be willing to use all of the tools in the toolbox,and that means we need to be using our diplomatic tools muchstronger. We need to use our economic tools. And we need, when we dofeel absolutely pressed to use a military alternative, we need to beclear not just on what our objective is going in, what the measureis of success, but what our plan is to get out on the other side.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We cannot fight endless wars. It's wrong.</p><p>TAPPER:  So, Daniel worked in Syria. He served in Syria. You'vesaid it's, quote, \"right to get our troops out of Syria,\" but youdid criticize President Trump for failing to plan the withdrawal...</p><p>WARREN:  Yes.</p><p>TAPPER:  ... with U.S. allies. The U.S. is currently planning toleave 400 or more servicemembers in Syria on what is being called apeacekeeping mission. Would you as president keep any troops on theground in Syria? And if so, how many?</p><p>WARREN:  I think we need to get out. We need to get out.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Until someone can identify -- and this is the whole point aboutit. I ask this in hearings in Armed Services. What is the measure ofsuccess? If you're going to be there, describe, let us see so we cantell if you're failing or succeeding at this. And no one can come upwith an answer. And until they can do that, we need our troops backhome.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I want to bring in Jayda Lee, a public health educatorfrom Jackson. Jada?</p><p>WARREN:  Hello, hi, Jayda.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi. Good evening. Mississippi has one of the highestmaternal mortality rates in the nation. Black and brown women makeup the majority of those who fall victim to higher rates ofpregnancy-related mortality.</p><p>WARREN:  Mm-hmm.</p><p>QUESTION:  Although some of this disparity can be attributed tolack of access, other issues are less easily explained. How wouldyou administration create legislation to improve outcomes for thesewomen?</p><p>WARREN:  So, it is an excellent question.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Let me tell you something I've already been working on in thisarea. This is a place where we need not only more funding for theNational Institutes of Health to be able to do the research, but weneed to insist that the National Institutes of Health is actuallydoing research and keeping track of male/female, AfricanAmerican/other races, so that we better understand all of what'swrong.</p><p>As you say, we know that part of this is related to lack ofaccess, but that's not explaining everything that's going on. Ibelieve in research. And we've got to support it so that it supportsall of our mamas and all of our babies. It's very important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>TAPPER:  Senator, I want to bring in Michael Barber. He's afreshman here at Jackson State University. He says he's currentlysupporting Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential run. Michael?</p><p>WARREN:  Hi, Michael.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, ma'am. Yeah, my question is we haveseen recently kids who have the luxury of parents paying their wayinto school no matter the GPA. The kids who attend inner cityschools do not have that luxury or the resources to excel and theysuffer greatly as they become closer to adult life. How would younot only improve, but make the educational system fair for allAmerican people?</p><p>WARREN:  All right. So, thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, this scandal just shows one more time that some folkswho are rich just think they don't have to play by the same set ofrules as anyone else and that they can use their money to dowhatever it is in terms of buying influence. We have to put a stopto that.</p><p>And it's not just -- it's everywhere now. And we're heretalking about a presidential primary. It's everywhere in Washington.You know, I just -- I want to say something about democracy for aminute. I get that we have a lot of differences. There will be somepeople who have a little more money, some people who have a littleless, some people who go further in school, some people who don't.But the one thing we should all own an equal share of is an equalshare of our democracy.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>We need a government that doesn't just listen to the rich andthe powerful, but a government that listens to all of us. And thatstarts right now in a Democratic primary. Something you can askeveryone in the Democratic primary who wants to ask for your vote isto ask them where they've been and how they've gotten their funding.</p><p>Me, I don't take corporate PAC money. In fact, I don't take PACmoney of any kind.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I don't take federal lobbyists' money. And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And I don't go behind closed doors with people of money andinfluence to try to get their help in this election. I come here tobe with you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Because I believe that our democracy is really on the ropes. Wehave a country that's working better and better and better for athinner and thinner slice at the top. In 2020, we have a chance totake that back. We have a chance to build a real grassrootsfoundation, face to face, person to person, neighborhood toneighborhood.</p><p>And if you believe that is how we should be running ourpresidential primary, I ask you, be part of this. Go toelizabethwarren.com. Be part of this. Make a contribution,volunteer. We're going to have to build this thing ourselves,because democracy is not a machine that will go of itself.</p><p>And government, our government, is not for sale. We need agovernment that works for the people, and that means the people haveto be there as part of it. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  I have one final question for you, Senator. Faith isvery important to many people across the country. It's veryimportant to many people in Mississippi. What role does faith playin your life, your public life and your private life?</p><p>WARREN:  So I was raised as a Methodist, and...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I was a fifth grade Sunday school teacher. All I can say is,nobody got hurt.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>It was a low bar for being a fifth grade Sunday school teacherat our church. And I raised my children in the Methodist church.What it is for me is the importance of the lessons we learn when weremember our values, when we remember our faith.</p><p>The story for me is Matthew 26, and I'm sure some of you -- alot of you know this story. You know, this is the one where theshepherd is dividing the world into the sheep and the goats. And aswe all know, sheep are going to heaven, goats, nah, they're not.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And the sheep ask him, why us? Why us, Lord? Why did you pickus? We look like those -- like those guys. And the shepherd, theLord, answers back by saying, \"I was hungry, and you gave me food. Iwas thirsty, and you gave me water. I was in prison, and you visitedme, naked and ye clothed me. Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one ofthese, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.\"</p><p>And what I hear in that is two things that guide me every day.The first is there is God, there is value in every single humanbeing.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Every single human being. And the second is that we are calledto action.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>That passage is not about you had a good thought and held ontoit, you sat back and were just a part of -- you know, thought aboutgood things. It does not say, you just didn't hurt anybody andthat's good enough. No.</p><p>It says, you saw something wrong, you saw somebody who wasthirsty, you saw somebody who was in prison.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You saw their face. You saw somebody who was hungry, and itmoved you to act. I believe we are called on to act.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>TAPPER:  Our thank you to Senator Elizabeth warren. Thank you,as well, to our audience here and to Jackson State University. Greatquestions from all of you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Be sure to tune in Wednesday night at 10 p.m. Eastern. DanaBash will moderate the next CNN Democratic candidate town hall withformer Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper. \"CNN Tonight\" startsright now.</p><p>WARREN:  Thank you.</p><p>END</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTNW-2193390820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X39-NXV1-DY0W-430G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9203\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 CQ Roll Call Mar 19, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Political Transcript Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>CNN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jackson State University</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Department of Justice</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mississippi</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Georgia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Teaching</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sheep</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White supremacists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Presidential elections</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 515210</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 611310</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 922130</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Debt Collection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjJFNEUwMDk3RTI3NEMxN0FDMkRBMzNBRDkzOTc5REE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njk4RUMyMDg4ODMwNDIwNUI1NEQwMDE0OUU3REYyOTM</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

A new coalition and a report unveiled last week make clear that era is over.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The coalition, Athena, comprises three dozen grassroots groups involved in issues like digital surveillance, antitrust and working conditions in warehouses. The goal is to encourage and unify the resistance to Amazon that is beginning to form.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The report, from the Economic Roundtable, a nonprofit research group that focuses on social and economic issues in Southern California, delves into the largely unexplored topic of what Amazon is costing the communities where it has warehouses. The short answer: a lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the simultaneous arrival of Athena and the report are a coincidence, they are linked by their attempts to understand and ultimately influence Amazon's push into almost every aspect of modern life. The internet conglomerate hired 97,000 employees over the summer, nearly the total employment of Google. The report is bluntly titled \"Too Big to Govern.\"</p><p> \"This is a company functioning at a scale that was previously left to government,\" said Tom Perriello of the Open Society Foundations. Founded by billionaire George Soros, Open Society is providing some of the seed funding for Athena. The coalition is raising $15 million to cover its first three years.</p><p> \"It has incredible impact,\" Perriello said of Amazon. \"Who could possibly shape its future and direction?\"</p><p>Amazon, like Facebook, Apple and Google, has drawn the attention of Washington regulators, state attorneys general and at least a few politicians in the past year. The central question being asked about all of the companies: When does a tech platform become too big and powerful, ultimately hurting the society it once dazzled?</p><p> In Amazon's case, the situation is particularly complicated. Its aspirations long ago exceeded online retail to encompass fresh groceries, devices that connect your home to the internet, front-door and neighborhood surveillance, professional services like plumbing and contracting, health care, government procurement, internet infrastructure and Hollywood entertainment. Just about everything, really.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment for this article.</p><p> Athena springs out of several unexpectedly successful grassroots efforts to rein in Amazon's power.</p><p> Last fall, the retailer was forced to begin paying a $15 hourly minimum wage nationwide. In February, it abandoned plans to establish a new headquarters in New York after opponents mobilized against Amazon and the politicians who had approved the deal. This month, an attempt to stack the City Council in Seattle, the company's hometown, with members more acceptable to Amazon backfired with voters.</p><p> These setbacks could be attributed to many factors, but one of them was the influence of labor and immigrant organizations. Now some of those groups are joining together under Athena.</p><p> \"We're learning from what makes Amazon back down, and looking to replicate that as much as possible with as many people as possible,\" said Dania Rajendra, the Athena director.</p><p> Athena will be run from New York, but the real work will be done out in the field where most of the member organizations are. They include the Awood Center, a Minneapolis nonprofit that has organized Amazon workers from East Africa; Warehouse Workers for Justice, which is based in Chicago; and Fight for the Future, a group that focuses on digital issues, in Massachusetts.</p><p> In a separate move, Fight for the Future and other groups have called on Congress to investigate Amazon's surveillance products, including the Ring front-door monitor and Rekognition facial tracking software. The products threaten \"our privacy and civil liberties, especially in brown and black communities,\" the groups said.</p><p> The effort against Amazon will not be easy, said Lauren Jacobs of the Partnership for Working Families, a coalition member in Oakland. Amazon is projected to have $238 billion in sales this year with 750,000 employees.</p><p> \"This is a David and Goliath story,\" she said. \"David took what he had and turned it into a winning strategy. We're taking what we have \u2014 the voices of the members of our various organizations, our collective knowledge and experience and deep understanding of the economy around Big Tech, and the experience we've had with making this company shift its behavior \u2014 and trying to build a more humane economy.\"</p><p> Athena's $15 million budget is modest for the scale of change it hopes to bring about. \"This is grassroots democracy,\" said Barry Lynn of Open Markets Institute, a Washington think tank and coalition member focused on antitrust issues. \"There's no money in it. Just people.\"</p><p> Perriello of the Open Society Foundations said updating protest movements for the digital era was an interesting challenge.</p><p> \"Uncertainty is now baked into the model,\" he said. \"You don't know where the fight is going to be two months from now or two years from now. So you need the ability to organize citizens of very different political stripes across geographies and across demographics, where traditionally you had to organize in place.\"</p><p> The name Athena is associated with democracy, freedom and wisdom. But it has another advantage for the coalition.</p><p> \"We didn't want to have Amazon in the name \u2014 People Against Amazon or whatever \u2014 because part of the strategy is to offer a better vision for how the economy could work,\" said Stacy Mitchell of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit in Maine that opposes corporate concentration and advocates local community development. \"To be for something, not just against.\"</p><p> Sheheryar Kaoosji of another coalition member, the Warehouse Worker Resource Center in Ontario, east of Los Angeles, said Athena was not planning a boycott of Amazon but was more interested in trying to sway it \u2014 including its employees and customers.</p><p> \"Half the households in America have an Amazon Prime account,\" Kaoosji said. \"That gives them a huge amount of power to change the company.\"</p><p> His group is dedicated to improving conditions in what is sometimes called \"the goods movement sector.\"</p><p> The resource center is in Southern California's Inland Empire, where the work is done to process those packages that appear on porches in Santa Monica and Newport Beach as if by magic.</p><p>Amazon workers and Amazon customers exist in two different worlds, the Economic Roundtable said. The report calculates that a little more than half of Amazon warehouse workers in Southern California live in substandard housing. And for every $1 in wages, they receive 24 cents in public assistance.</p><p> \"Every day, ships, trucks, trains and airplanes bring an estimated 21,500 diesel truckloads of merchandise to 21 Amazon warehouses in the four-county region,\" the Economic Roundtable report said. It calculated that Amazon trucks last year created $642 million in \"uncompensated public costs\" for noise, road wear, accidents and harmful emissions.</p><p> Almost as an aside, the report indicated how adept Amazon, with a stock market value of nearly $900 billion, is at getting funding from California and local communities. This included $25 million from the California Film Commission to subsidize six productions, including the third season of \"Sneaky Pete,\" an Amazon crime drama, and $1.2 million from the California Office of Business and Economic Development toward an office building in Irvine for programmers.</p><p> The report noted on its title page that it was underwritten by the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, which represents more than 800,000 members of 300 unions. The Economic Roundtable said that did not affect the results.</p><p> Among the report's suggestions: that Amazon raise its minimum wage to $20 an hour, that it require its logistics subcontractors to do the same, that it provide child care at its warehouses and that it build affordable housing in its logistics communities.</p><p> The report draws on California Public Records Act requests filed with communities with Amazon facilities. Many of them nevertheless came up empty. The report noted that very little of Amazon's business was known to anyone but Amazon. Communities are in the dark.</p><p> \"Our conclusion is that it's time for Amazon to come of age and pay its own way,\" said Daniel Flaming, a co-author of the report. \"This means paying its full costs to the communities that host it and the workers who create its profits.\"</p><p> David Streitfeld is a New York Times writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-ff88cd6bf34c21191715398f5435cfe7bb93d07c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMH-8DG1-JBCN-442X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Our government's determination to address online safety is to be commended, but the current proposals contain few details on policy and implementation. In reality we're unlikely to see much improvement in online safety unless we tackle the real elephant in the room: big tech's business model. Read more: How big tech designs its own rules of ethics to avoid scrutiny and accountability Four initiatives The plan consists of four initiatives. The first would see increased maximum penalties for existing crimes such as using the internet to menace, harass or cause offence. </p><p>Penalties would also increase, and new offences created, for a range of child sex offences that rely on the internet. The second initiative is designed to hold major social media platforms to account by enacting laws that require them to provide transparency reports relating to illegal, abusive and predatory content by their users - that is, trolling. The third is to provide parents with tools to 'make their own decisions about how their children use the internet'. It will become mandatory for online apps, games and services marketed to children to be pre-configured with the most restrictive privacy and safety defaults. Complementary initiatives involve providing a filtered internet service that blocks sites considered unsafe by the eSafety Commissioner, and providing point of sale and point of account creation information to parents about online safety and parental controls. The final initiative is to work with the G20 to 'ensure that technology firms meet obligations regarding the prevention and protection, transparency and deterrence to stop terrorists weaponising the internet'. Scandals and social harm In the wake of a variety of scandals that have plagued 'big tech' over the last few years - including the Facebook Cambrige Analytica controversy , and Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 US Presidential elections - governments across the world have become increasingly concerned about the social harms produced by a largely unregulated technology sector. The Coalition's election announcement comes soon after the passage of amendments to the Criminal Code to address live streaming of 'abhorrent violent material' by social media platforms in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. It should be seen as an advance in governmental resolve to address the excesses of big tech. This is a long overdue and welcome development. Read more: Livestreaming terror is abhorrent - but is more rushed legislation the answer? Extra offences and tougher penalties, particularly for online-enabled sexual exploitation of children, play well in a febrile pre-election environment. The prospect of more punishment and denunciation seems like tough and determined action will be taken. But the deterrent effect of criminalising activity and imposing harsher jail sentences is based on an assumption that people weigh up the costs and benefits of their actions whenever they make decisions - that they make rational criminal choices. This assumption is open to question where online harassment and child sex offending occurs. Equally, there is little evidence that jail time for sex offenders serves rehabilitative objectives or that, long term, the community is safer. After all, when offenders have served their time they are released and return to the community. Read more: Helping to rehabilitate sex offenders is controversial - but it can prevent more abuse It's easy - and cheap - to legislate for new offences and more incarceration. It's harder - and expensive - to ensure the community is safer in the long term. This involves addressing causes, not effects. Only the 'major' platforms The proposed greater transparency measures appear to apply only to 'major' social media platforms . Presumably, this means digital platforms that have a corporate presence in Australia - like Google and Facebook - and who can be compelled to obey Australian laws. But there are many other sites that Australians access which have no presence, other than a cyber presence, in Australia. Has the Coalition taken account of the fact that those who choose to propagate 'illegal, abusive and predatory' content may simply switch their activities to platforms like 4 Chan, 8 Chan or reddit to avoid transparency requirements, making it harder to regulate them? How will they be made transparent? Another challenge is how to define 'illegal, abusive and predatory content'. Presumably government will provide legislative guidance about this in its proposed Online Safety Act, but it will be interesting to see how Silicon Valley corporations steeped in US first amendment free speech doctrine interpret and implement this requirement. Read more: We need to talk about the data we give freely of ourselves online and why it's useful Policing is the hard bit One of big tech's most consistent arguments to avoid regulation is that we should rely on technology to solve technology-caused harm . The Coalition's proposal to provide parents with controls to 'make their own decisions about how their children use the internet' falls into this category. But how are default privacy and safety settings to be policed? What will stop curious, technically-literate children simply changing the default settings behind their parents' backs? Likewise, the proposal to supply filtered internet services that block sites nominated by the e-Safety Commissioner seems like an invitation to find work-arounds to avoid censorship. Read more: Sorry everyone: on the internet, you're always the product As commentators like Roger McNamee , Zeynep Tufekci and Tristan Harris have argued, the risks that big tech poses to society are caused by their 'free' service business model. The need to collect more and more personal data and keep their users' attention focused on their services by feeding them more and more content that they 'like' is baked into social media corporate DNA. Companies create 'filter bubbles' and 'preference bubbles' that ensure popular content is succeeded by more extreme and disturbing versions of the same. Big tech's business model is the root cause of the harms the Coalition's online safety package is designed to address. Although any government action to address these harms is to be encouraged and supported, the package is likely to fall short of our expectations.<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Facebook Social media Internet Internet law Online safety Election 2019 Federal election 2019</p></bodyText></listItem></list><br/>MENAFN0705201901990000ID1098485616</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098485616</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W29-TYV1-F04Y-T0C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 7, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Penalties would also increase, and new offences created, for a range of child sex offences that rely on the internet. </p><p>The second initiative is designed to hold major social media platforms to account by enacting laws that require them to provide transparency reports relating to illegal, abusive and predatory content by their users - that is, trolling.</p><p>The third is to provide parents with tools to \"make their own decisions about how their children use the internet\". It will become mandatory for online apps, games and services marketed to children to be pre-configured with the most restrictive privacy and safety defaults. </p><p>Complementary initiatives involve providing a filtered internet service that blocks sites considered unsafe by the eSafety Commissioner, and providing point of sale and point of account creation information to parents about online safety and parental controls.</p><p>The final initiative is to work with the G20 to \"ensure that technology firms meet obligations regarding the prevention and protection, transparency and deterrence to stop terrorists weaponising the internet\".</p><h>Scandals and social harm</h><p>In the wake of a variety of scandals that have plagued \"big tech\" over the last few years - including the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/we-need-to-talk-about-the-data-we-give-freely-of-ourselves-online-and-why-its-useful-93734\">Facebook Cambrige Analytica controversy</url>, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/mueller-report-how-congress-can-and-will-follow-up-on-an-incomplete-and-redacted-document-115686\">Robert Mueller's investigation</url> into Russian interference with the 2016 US Presidential elections -  governments across the world have become increasingly concerned about the social harms produced by a largely unregulated technology sector. </p><p>The Coalition's election announcement comes soon after the passage of <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/livestreaming-terror-is-abhorrent-but-is-more-rushed-legislation-the-answer-114620\">amendments to the Criminal Code</url> to address live streaming of \"abhorrent violent material\" by social media platforms in the wake of the Christchurch massacre. It should be seen as an advance in governmental resolve to address the excesses of big tech. This is a long overdue and welcome development.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Livestreaming terror is abhorrent - but is more rushed legislation the answer?</emphasis></p><p>Extra offences and tougher penalties, particularly for online-enabled sexual exploitation of children, play well in a febrile pre-election environment. The prospect of more punishment and denunciation seems like tough and determined action will be taken. </p><p>But the deterrent effect of criminalising activity and imposing harsher jail sentences is based on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sentencingcouncil.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/publication-documents/Does%20Imprisonment%20Deter%20A%20Review%20of%20the%20Evidence.pdf\">an assumption</url> that people weigh up the costs and benefits of their actions whenever they make decisions - that they make rational criminal choices. This assumption is open to question where online harassment and child sex offending occurs. </p><p>Equally, there is <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/helping-to-rehabilitate-sex-offenders-is-controversial-but-it-can-prevent-more-abuse-111861\">little evidence</url> that jail time for sex offenders serves rehabilitative objectives or that, long term, the community is safer. After all, when offenders have served their time they are released and return to the community. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Helping to rehabilitate sex offenders is controversial - but it can prevent more abuse</emphasis></p><p>It's easy - and cheap - to legislate for new offences and more incarceration. It's harder - and expensive - to ensure the community is safer in the long term. This involves addressing causes, not effects. </p><h>Only the 'major' platforms</h><p>The proposed greater transparency measures appear to apply only to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.liberal.org.au/latest-news/2019/05/05/keeping-australians-safe-online\">\"major\" social media platforms</url>. Presumably, this means digital platforms that have a corporate presence in Australia - like Google and Facebook - and who can be compelled to obey Australian laws. </p><p>But there are many other sites that Australians access which have no presence, other than a cyber presence, in Australia.  </p><p>Has the Coalition taken account of the fact that those who choose to propagate \"illegal, abusive and predatory\" content may simply switch their activities to platforms like 4 Chan, 8 Chan or reddit to avoid transparency requirements, making it harder to regulate them? How will they be made transparent? </p><p>Another challenge is how to define \"illegal, abusive and predatory content\". Presumably government will provide legislative guidance about this in its proposed Online Safety Act, but it will be interesting to see how Silicon Valley corporations steeped in US first amendment free speech doctrine interpret and implement this requirement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: We need to talk about the data we give freely of ourselves online and why it's useful</emphasis></p><h>Policing is the hard bit</h><p>One of big tech's most consistent arguments to avoid regulation is that we should <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/11/ai-will-solve-facebooks-most-vexing-problems-mark-zuckerberg-says-just-dont-ask-when-or-how/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cd5d347aa069\">rely on technology to solve technology-caused harm</url>. The Coalition's proposal to provide parents with controls to \"make their own decisions about how their children use the internet\" falls into this category. </p><p>But how are default privacy and safety settings to be policed?

The Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen, Demand Progress and Content Creators Coalition were among organizations signing onto Freedom From Facebook. The campaign asks the FTC to \"develop interoperability standards, so users will have the freedom to communicate between competing social networks\" and to implement stronger privacy rules. The FTC \"and other regulators and policy makers [should] confront the power of Facebook and the monopoly of online platforms,\" Demand Progress Executive Director David Segal said. The organization cited Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin calling for DOJ to investigate big tech concentration of ownership. A Facebook spokesman said people use it, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger because they find them valuable: \"We support smart privacy regulation and efforts that make it easier for people to take their data to competing services. But rather than wait, we've simplified our privacy controls and introduced new ways for people to access and delete their data, or to take their data with them.\" The FTC didn't comment. Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association CEO Ed Black said the campaign is \"misguided political fervor that ignores the economic facts, lacks evidence of competitive harm, and purposes an extreme resolution that would harm consumers and reduce innovation.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SCJ-2H31-JC8G-80H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"245\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 22, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>PUBLIC CITIZEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>COMPUTER &amp;

How the media really works and how the news gets made and how all of us can make it a bit better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm John Avlon, filling in for Brian Stelter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This hour, Jussie Smollett. Why it's the perfect storm of politics and pop culture, hate crimes and hoaxes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, one-on-one with Barry Diller, the media mogul talks Hollywood's identity crisis, Facebook regulation and his concern about Dems in 2020.</p><p>And a new hire here at CNN spurs controversy and confusion. We'll try to clear it up for you.</p><p>But, first, in an era where insane is the new normal, there's always a danger that nothing is shocking. Perspective is a thing we have least of in our politics. And that's why it's helpful to take a step back sometimes and do a data-driven reality check.</p><p>A fascinating \"New York Times\" analysis this week showed that President Trump has attacked the Russia investigation more than 1,100 times. He uses signature moves of distraction, deflection and division. The larger goal, of course, is to discredit the investigation through reputation. It resonates with his base.</p><p>But faced with a blizzard of lies and fact-free attacks, normalization starts to creep in. And we become numb to it as citizens and journalists.</p><p>So when the president calls for someone to look into \"Saturday Night Live\" because he doesn't like their satire, it gets cursory coverage now. Over the past week, angry predawn tweets from the president calling journalists the enemy of the people received something close to a collective shrug. But what would be an extraordinary attack on the free press by almost any other president becomes just another day at the office.</p><p>But every once in a while, we get a visceral reminder of the real cost of this talk. This week, it came in the form of a chilling indictment against a former marine who works at the Coast Guard headquarters in Washington. He's name is Lieutenant Christopher Paul Hasson. He's avowed white nationalist who actively plotting domestic terror attacks targeting the president's political opponents and cable news journalists, including CNN's Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, and Van Jones, as well as MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, Chris Hayes and Ari Melber.</p><p>This comes four months after pipe bombs were sent to prominent Democrats and journalists at CNN. Four months before that, the deadliest newsroom shooting in American history at the \"Capital Gazette\" in Annapolis.</p><p>The point is not that there's culpability on the part of the president, but there is growing pattern of threats against the press, and that's nothing we can afford to ignore in a free society.</p><p>Joining me now to talk about how to confront the numbing of the American mind and defend the free press, it's an all-star panel. \"New York Times\" columnist Charles Blow, CNN's SVP of news gathering, Mitra Kalita, and the former president of the Slate Group and founder of Pushkin Media, and, Yale profession of journalism, Jacob Weisberg.</p><p>Thank you all for joining me.</p><p>Mitra, let's start with you. There are choices we make in journalism every day, and one of the most difficult is how to cover the president's lies, mistruths, versus some of the other things happening in the world that are larger and bigger in some respects than holding him to account, Venezuela comes to mind.</p><p>How do you make those judgments in the newsroom every day, between holding the president to account and telling people what's happening larger in the world?</p><p>S. MITRA KALITA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CNN DIGITAL NEWS &amp; PROGRAMMING: So, thankfully, on Digital, this is not an either or proposition. It's very much both of those tracks are vital to our mission as journalists. Most of us got into this for both of the objectives you've mentioned. One, to inform a society, to be the underpinning of their information, and then what you're describing which is to hold power to account.</p><p>And so when the president, you know, repeatedly says we're the enemy of the people, the question then becomes, how do we respond to that? One, response would be adversarially. The other would be to say, you know, this is what we do, we're here to serve the public. And to remind them of that not necessarily by only responding to the president's attack, but, you know, showing our importance during criminal investigations, during hurricanes, during --</p><p>AVLON: It's a matter of --</p><p>KALITA: -- the stuff that makes our news agenda, right --</p><p>AVLON: It's a matter of walking and chewing gum and having a big enough newsroom to be able to do both.</p><p>Charles, let me go to you because one of our former colleague and friend, David Frum, the smartest guy, had a tweet over the weekend, noting that in his local paper, the Coast Guard shooter in the indictment was in the local section. And he took that as a sign of kind of the normalization and numbing that we're confronting. Is this a case of us growing dangerously numb? Or is this a case of the difficulty covering the gun that didn't go off?</p><p>CHARLES BLOW, OP-ED COLUMNIST, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I mean, I guess we are numb to some degree.</p><p>[11:05:02] But I think to put it in a larger context of what's happening is important. People consider the media the fourth estate, right? Basically a fourth branch of government.</p><p>What you have now is if you take that context and that framing, one branch of the government attacking the other. And that is -- you know, it's a very difficult thing to defend against. And the media, unlike the other three branches, there's no election. There is no confirmation hearing.</p><p>It is -- the media is enormous relative to the other branches. And as the definition of what the media is keeps expanding, you know, there become a lot of vulnerabilities both in terms of credibility but also physical personal vulnerabilities. There are no guards at my house like there are at the White House. There's no guards at my house like there are at the Supreme Court or Congress.</p><p>And so, there are actual vulnerabilities to you as a journalist, but there are also credibility concepts around are we now lumping in everyone who blogs and does so seriously? And I think there's a lot of great journalism happening in that way, but also there's some journalism that I'd be more skeptical about happening that way. And so, the elasticity of the concept becomes a tricky thing.</p><p>AVLON: Jacob, you know, one of the real conversations is, is the president simply talking as he does, spouting off, and we shouldn't over-index the impact. But every once in a while, you start to see him change the terms of the conversation, and that seems striking this week when we saw an opinion from Judge Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court justice, picking up the mantel of the president's past claims that we should libel reforms, target the press, by saying that Sullivan v. New York, a landmark libel case, should be reexamined.</p><p>What's your take on that?</p><p>JACOB WEISBERG, FORMER EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SLATE GROUP: Well, I don't think it's plausible. Sullivan was a 9-0 decision. And I think conservatives have long realized that freedom of the press protects conservative views as well as liberal views. In that case, along with the Pentagon Papers case, which is at the time (ph) the United States, are the foundations of the modern interruption of the First Amendment. They're the pillars of what make the American press the freest in the world.</p><p>That used to we an idea that the United States government had an interest in developing abroad, and in places like the Philippine where democracy was emerging, we were on the side of the free press. Now, we have a president who's giving a kind of permissioning to dictators who want to pull it back in the other direction, who are harassing the press, like Maria Ressa, this press freedom hero in the Philippines, and Duterte in the Philippines is an example of someone who does that, specifically citing fake news, enemy of the people.</p><p>So, the concern is that what Trump does creates a kind of permissioning and creates a climate where these attacks -- violent attacks here are maybe not specifically attributable to Trump but are take place in the atmosphere that he's creating.</p><p>AVLON: It sets a broader tone.</p><p>Mitra, I wonder if you put Sullivan v. \"New York Times\" in context because it happens during the civil rights movement --</p><p>KALITA: Sure.</p><p>AVLON: -- where libel laws are being wielded for really specific chilling purposes.</p><p>KALITA: So, I think what's important to know about \"New York Times\" versus Sullivan is actually that the lawsuit was against an advertisement, right? When we see \"New York Times\", we'll just assume it was about the journalism, but that's -- this was actually an advertisement by a group of people trying to defend Martin Luther King and raise money for him.</p><p>And I think what is borne out of this civil rights era decision is holding public figures such as the police, politicians -- you know, we see that redefined for celebrities and becoming more expansive. In the modern definition of media, \"New York Times\" versus Sullivan really is, speaking of how we cover and hold power to account, the underpinning of that belief in journalism.</p><p>AVLON: Jacob, just quickly, as one who's run an independent media outfit, I don't think folks appreciate how much the threat of lawsuits can have a chilling on speech.</p><p>WEISBERG: Well, sure, and financially weaker news organizations, which almost all of them are now, are in a weaker position to stand up to wealthy bullies who may want to punish them because of something they don't like. What Times v. Sullivan protects is honest error.</p><p>Error is part of journalism. Mistakes happen, and what that case says is that mistakes that aren't intentional, mistakes versus lies are protected by the First Amendment in most cases.</p><p>AVLON: We're going to have to live it there. But, Charles, stick around for the next weekend.</p><p>[11:10:01] Mitra, Jacob, thank you for joining us on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>WEISBERG: Thank you, John.</p><p>AVLON: Up next, Jussie Smollett. The story received wall to wall coverage and why both police are pointing fingers at the news media.</p><p>But before we go to break, it's Oscar Sunday, so I thought it would be fun to have some fellow CNN anchors ask what their favorite movie is and here's John Berman. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: My favorite journalism movie is easy. \"All the President's Men\" because that's why we all gotten in this business, and side note, it's the coolest thing ever I occasionally get to speak to Carl Bernstein sometimes. Number two, \"Up Close and Personal\" only because it's top Michelle Pfeiffer filmmaking and there are no actual real parallels with television news inside that movie, which segues to number three, which is \"Broadcast News,\" which isn't fiction. It's like a documentary. It is actual footage of what it is like in the television business.</p><p>And let me tell you everyone's career in this business is a struggle between being Albert Brooks and William Hurt, and the dirty truth is, the William Hurt always wins.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>As the strange saga of the Jussie Smollett case continues, one of the biggest criticisms we hear is against the media.</p><p>[11:15:05] And we heard it from the Chicago police department loud and clear.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SUPERINTENDENT EDDIE JOHNSON, CHICAGO POLICE: This didn't get any special attention. You all gave this more attention specifically than we do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: This has been a heated national conversation. So let's lay out some facts.</p><p>First, there were 7,175 hate crime incidents in 2017, according to the Department of Justice. That's a 17 percent increase over the previous year. Not only that, the number of hate groups in the U.S. has increased 30 percent over the past four years, according to the SPLC.</p><p>The hate crime hoaxes do occur, but they are very rare if possibly on the rise. According to the director at Center of Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University in San Bernardino, there have been at least 49 hate crime reports between 2016 and 2018. But often these cases are high profile and this can go back to Tawana Brawley in New York City in the '80s, the UVA rape case falsely reported at \"Rolling Stone\", and in more recent years, incidents at the Air Force Academy, St. Olaf College, and the New York City subway system.</p><p>I think it's important to put both things in perspective because too often conservative media focuses on a few hoaxes, while liberals sometimes rush to judgment on the other side. Joining me now, Charles Blow, back, \"New York Times\" columnist, L.Z. Granderson, ESPN host and sports and culture columnist for \"The L.A. Times\", and John McWhorter, associate professor of linguistics at Columbia University, and contributing editor for \"The Atlantic\".</p><p>It's great to have you all here.</p><p>L.Z., let me begin with you. Part of the criticism we heard from the Chicago superintendent is that there was so much attention given to this one case and not nearly enough at the shootings in Chicago or the other hate crimes that have borne out around the country.</p><p>But you, as somebody who writes at the intersection of politics and pop culture often ought to recognize two things. One, shouldn't there be an assumption that the cases are legitimate? And two, wasn't this going to be something that captured people's attention out of the gate because of those elements?</p><p>L.Z. GRANDERSON, ESPN HOST: Well, you know, first of all, it's great to be back with you, John. It's been a while since I've seen you.</p><p>You know, first, I kind of chuckled a little bit having been in Chicago, reported in Chicago at the idea that this case in particular sullied the Chicago name as it relates to gun violence in the city or just violence in general. Chicago is known to have issues when it comes to violence. So, for the chief to insinuate this case dragged the Chicago name through the mud I thought was disingenuous.</p><p>And then, also, just the number of man hours and detective hours that were used in this one case in particularly, I don't have the facts in front of me, but I do know having lived and reported as I said before, 20 detectives over the course of three weeks for one case doesn't seem to be the norm based upon my own reporting in the city. So, I thought he was disingenuous just in terms of how Chicago was positioned.</p><p>Now, back to your question -- yes, it was given extra attention because he's a celebrity on a very popular TV show, and to pretend otherwise would be disingenuous of the media. My biggest criticism, John, is that we dropped the word \"alleged\" very early in our reporting of this, and when you had political commentators like myself, you didn't correct us when we didn't use the word \"alleged\" as well.</p><p>AVLON: Interesting. That's fascinating and important point.</p><p>John McWhorter, I want to go to you because you wrote an essay which was getting a lot of attention in the Atlantic about the underlying aspect of what you call victimhood chic, trying to understand in some respects the sociology and maybe psychology of hate crimes hoaxes, because it's sort of baffling and troubling.</p><p>JOHN MCWHORTER, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LINGUISTICS, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY: Yes. I mean, the question is, given the reality of these racist attacks and homophobic attacks, why would a person pretend that it had happened to them, and why isn't that something you hear about in 1946, in 1966? Why is it that now we have a Rachel Dolezal who's white and part of her act is to fake these violent and/or hostile racist acts against her? Imagine that person even in 1986.</p><p>Or somebody like Jussie Smollett who is a big star on a big TV and yet feels sincerely, as a sane person, he's sane, that's what's interesting about this. He doesn't have any mental problems, that it would make him more interesting and important to have been attacked?</p><p>That's something that's relatively new, and I think what we're seeing is there is something you could call victimhood chic, where the idea is what makes you most interesting is that you have been the victim of some sort of bigotry. And it's certainly true that these cases don't happen at the rate of thousands a year. But I'd say, if there had been 48 cases like this from 2016 to 2018, a certain crowd of usual suspects would be saying it was a national crisis and what America is all about if it was, say, cop killings. If there were that many white men killing black men, everybody would say that 48 was more than enough.</p><p>So, here I think we are talking about a real phenonomen.</p><p>[11:20:01] And it worries me because it's about the black self image, especially among black people who come of age roughly in the 21st century. It worries me that anybody would think saying they've been jumped by somebody white makes them more interesting than anything else they could possibly do, especially because it's a kind of capitulation to evil.</p><p>AVLON: Well, and part of what's there is the sense that we've been honoring appropriately the victims of hate. And so, there's a heroic patina that maybe they're reaching for.</p><p>Charles, when we first talked about this, and it first became clear that the story maybe wasn't so solid, you said if this is true, he must be a psychopath. Do you think that's the case or do you think there's something to what John is describing is victimhood chic?</p><p>BLOW: Well, I mean, that's not my -- I'm not even going to discuss that theory. But, yes, if he has made all this up, I mean, I don't know how else to describe what that would mean because it's not just that he would have made it up. It was -- the Robin Roberts interview is fascinating when viewed in light of what the police alleged he did.</p><p>It was -- you know, saying not only that this happened to me, that you guys are all wrong who are doubting what I've done, that I am a vigilante of sorts. He said that on stage as well, that, you know, I'm the gay Tupac.</p><p>I know once you're in, you're all in. You know, O.J. showed up at Nicole's funeral and held the kids and cried. I mean, once you're in, you're all in. But that is psychopath behavior.</p><p>And for him to continuously go out and say, no, no, there's no way if in fact he did what the police said he did, there's no huge break with reality there, and there's also a kind of commitment to the lie and to the persona that would be disturbing if this is true.</p><p>AVLON: L.Z., I mean do you think this is something that simply reinforces the fact that we all need to be skeptical and suspend our judgment, or is this on a deeper level almost a tragedy because it undercuts the real cases in such a fundamental way?</p><p>GRANDERSON: Well, I think if you're speaking of objective journalist, then we should always greet these sort of cases regardless of the players involved as alleged until they've gone through the proper channels and legal system. I mean, to me that is the great lesson to be learned here from a media perspective is that we assumed that no one would do something like this, especially a celebrity because it didn't make much sense.</p><p>We are supposed to run that through that particular filter. We're supposed to run it through the checks and balances of proper journalism, which an attack is alleged until a jury or judge says otherwise. So, I think --</p><p>AVLON: That's an important point that's been missing from some of our debates, at least as they play out in social media, the social media mob.</p><p>And, John, I want to end with you because that's exactly what I think some of the conversation has been about. Where have been the checks and balance, the presumption of innocence, the degree of skepticism? Instead, there's a rushing to the ramparts.</p><p>Has social media made it worse? And have you seen a kind of deep blowback on this piece or something surprising?</p><p>MCWHORTER: Social media does make this worse because we end up talking to each other all day long about these things in visceral terms, telegraphic terms as if we were in a village 100,000 years ago. So, all this happens faster and it encourages the shouters.</p><p>But actually, I really do think in a case like this, what we're seeing is not that America, at least any sensible America, is thinking that there's no such thing as a hate crime or a race crime. I think Ann Coulter has said that. I generally don't know what reality she's in to tweet something like that out.</p><p>AVLON: Yes, that's reasonable.</p><p>MCWHORTER: We can both chew gum and walk at the same time. There are these hate crimes. But then when somebody claims as a B and a half list star, they get jumped in a heavy coat in the middle of the night by people shouting exactly the right things and hanging a noose around his neck, which is something black people seemed to always say somebody did, rather than that white people often do, we are right to be skeptical and just to wonder, and we might think of Jussie Smollett as relative unique.</p><p>But I worry that that uniqueness is of a kind where he thinks that the coolest way to be black or black and gay is to have been beaten up and live to tell about it. No, that's not what civil rights was supposed to be about.</p><p>AVLON: And the larger problem is that it undercuts the historical memory of all these cases that have been all too real and still haunt us as a country.</p><p>Gentlemen, I want to thank you all very much for joining. L.Z., Charles, John.</p><p>Up next, Barry Diller moves from movies to digital and he's had on a role in revolutionizing it all, and I sat with him when we return.</p><p>But, first, here's Kate Bolduan's favorite journalism movies as we count down to the Oscars.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[11:25:01] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: Hey, John, I couldn't pick just one movie about journalism. So, here are my top three. \"Broadcast News\", a classic, of course. \"The Post\" because of the amazing performances and because of quotes like, if we don't hold them accountable, who will? And last but not least, \"Mission Impossible: Fallout\", only because our beloved Wolf Blitzer makes a very important cameo.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: Welcome back. I'm John Avlon, in for Brian Stelter, and we are hours away from the Oscars.</p><p>And earlier, I spoke to legendary media mogul Barry Diller, who's done everything from running a movie studio in Hollywood's glory days, to starting an online empire known as IAC. He's a man who weaponizes his curiosity, and here's what he told me.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[11:29:47]</p><p>AVLON: Barry Diller, thanks for us on RELIABLE SOURCES. Let's talk about Hollywood given that it's Oscar weekend. You made some comments to Kara Swisher that old Hollywood is dead. You famously throw a big bash on Oscar weekend. What have you been hearing from your friends back in old Hollywood about your predictions of their demise?</p><p>BARRY DILLER, CHAIRMAN, INTERACTIVE CORP: Well, first of all, yes, they throw a little bricks at me and I gently toss them back. Saying, too bit out of context, and it is out of context. It's not that these companies are going out of business, it's just their hegemony which has gone on for the last hundred years is over.</p><p>And I think that's probably healthy to recognize that maybe you don't like it necessarily. But, you know, look, technology has changed so many things. A movie, what is a movie today? You know that is truly blurred. The word movie is going through its first change since probably 1928 or nine when sound came into the movies. So, is a revolution happening?</p><p>AVLON: One of the really fascinating media scandals of our time that has a lot of history behind it. And that's the attempted extortion of Jeff Bezos by American media, by the National Inquirer. What was your reaction?</p><p>DILLER: I thought the only really interesting part of it. I mean that seemed to be something that anybody should pay attention to, was Mr. Bezos' reaction to it which was in truly courageous.</p><p>I mean, he could have as many people would do is suppress it, do anything he could to avoid continuing, you know, one of the things you do with stories is you don't want to put fire on them, what he put huge gasoline flames on them because he said you're not going to blackmail me and get away with it. Because if I can't withstand it, no one can.</p><p>And to do that as an individual, a public person who has God knows other things to occupy his time was a matter of I think honor and courage. And that to me was the story.</p><p>AVLON: On the flip side with American media, did you consider this sort of simply a new low in a company that's already been implicated lots of other scandals and connections with President Trump?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DILLER: You can't -- you can't -- you can't -- you can't do new low. I mean, there is no lower. Well, what's lower? The National Enquirer is a bad rag.</p><p>AVLON: Sure.</p><p>DILER: Meaning, all it does is exploit people at kind of the lowest kind of concept of whatever it is that can -- you know, excite the supermarket check lines. I don't have many comparisons to the Enquirer. I mean there was. Thank God, it was actually put out of business, it was called Gawker. And Gawker did the same sleazy kind of tactics. And its tactics got them caught into absolutely, annihilation, a good thing.</p><p>AVLON: You are the owner of The Daily Beast, my former publication. But there's a lot of pressures on digital media companies. Just the last several weeks, we've seen significant layoffs at vice and BuzzFeed. Two very hyped brands backed by V.C. capital.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DILLER: Oh yes. Yes, yes, but who cares?</p><p>AVLON: Vice laid off 10 percent of its staff which is 250 people. My question to you is what's --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DILLER: I'm sorry. I shouldn't say who cares, like. I'm not saying who cares in terms of the fact that I don't care about people being laid off, I do. But I don't think that digital media -- digital publishing which in a sense got -- you know, kind of free money for a while on the theory that it could compete. It's very difficult to compete in publishing today.</p><p>But the truth of it is, is the big, big powers of journalism are competing very, very well. New York Times is doing quite well. Washington Post is doing well. Digital publishing for small players is just a very difficult business model. I do think that over the next couple of years or wouldn't keep investing in The Daily Beast that, in fact, subscriptions are going to come online to replace the digital advertising portion of it. Because digital advertising is just not a good game for anybody.</p><p>And so, I'm hopeful that they will improve, but they probably went as they say (INAUDIBLE) in front of their skis.</p><p>AVLON: One of your favorite topics, big tech platforms, Facebook. There was a parliamentary report this past week released calling digital gangsters and saying the thing that they were willing to override its user's privacy settings in order to transfer data to app developers.</p><p>DILLER: Oh, yes.</p><p>AVLON: Should these big tech platforms be subject to regulation to ensure competition if so what?</p><p>[11:34:56] DILLER: Of course, they need appropriate regulation. Their app -- look, it's not necessarily willful, it's just the nature of things. Now, I think we over-regulated -- know, last -- you know, a period in many respects.</p><p>But I do think that prudent regulation is going to come on -- are going to come along in the next several years when you have situations where it is for the -- it is for the public good.</p><p>AVLON: You were a big supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2016. What lessons do you think the party should take from her loss, and is there anyone you like in 2020 at this point?</p><p>DILLER: I even though I think its odds difficult. The person I've committed to not that -- it my commitment means anything. In this case, is Michael Bloomberg, I think it's going to be probably a more difficult role than for others. As for the rest of it as a big group that winner themselves out. I think the Democrats, my great worry is, is they're putting their foot in it right now. And I worry that they're going to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.</p><p>AVLON: How so? This is not an election about economics. The economy is OK. This is an election about morality and decency. So, this is not going to get won on arguing that. It will get won on arguing the only relevant issue.</p><p>We have an indecent president and that is a moral question. And it is that question that topic that I think everything should and I hope will revolve around.</p><p>AVLON: Barry Diller, thank you very much for joining us on RELIABLE SOURCES. Appreciate your time. DILLER: Pleasure.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>AVLON: You can see more of my interview with Barry Diller at reliablesources.com. But up next, a hiring here, CNN made last week is taking a lot of attention. We're going to take a deeper look at after the break. Coming up, at the top of the hour is Jake Tapper. And Jake, what's your favorite journalism movie?</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: Citizen Kane, Frost/Nixon, Good Night, and Good Luck, there are too many great movies about journalism to really pick one favorite. But if I have to narrow it down, Broadcast News and All the President's Men are two movies I could watch anytime.</p><p>[11:41:21] AVLON: Now we want to turn the spotlight on ourselves in the spirit of transparency. This past week, there was some controversy and confusion around the announcement that CNN would be hiring Sarah Isgur Flores. A Harvard Law graduate, a longtime Republican operative, and most recently, the spokeswoman at the Trump Department of Justice.</p><p>First, let's clear a few things up. There was a mistaken idea circulating that Sarah Flores would be directing CNN's political coverage in the 2020 election. That's false. We have a political director already, David Chalian and an extensive political team which she's joining in.</p><p>In addition, she won't be working on Democratic debates or town halls because we already have an extensive special events team doing so. But let's cut to the chase. A lot of the fallout stems from the fact that she's a veteran of the Trump Justice Department. So, discuss that and more, I'm joined by NPR media reporter and host of NPR's on point podcast David Folkenflik. And S.E. Cupp, host of CNN's \"S.E. CUPP UNFILTERED\". S.E., happy birthday. But first, David, let me start with you.</p><p>S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Thanks.</p><p>AVLON: There is a long history of people moving from politics to journalism. For example, Bill Moyers, what for being LBJ's press secretary to being the publisher of Newsday.</p><p>Diane Sawyer was a Nixon aide before she became one of the most iconic anchors of her generation. Tim Russert who would I argue was the greatest political anchor of all time. Was a senior aide to Senator Moynihan and Governor Cuomo.</p><p>NBC's Pete Williams served as a spokesman for Dick Cheney and Bush 41's Department of Defense before becoming one of the best Pentagon reporters on T.V.</p><p>And finally, George Stephanopoulos, who held the war room for Bill Clinton's 92 campaign and ran his communications in the White House, before becoming the widely respected host of GMA and this week.</p><p>I myself, started in politics, working as a speechwriter for Rudolph Giuliani. So, David, against this backdrop, shouldn't Sarah be granted the same opportunity to prove herself?</p><p>DAVID FOLKENFLIK, MEDIA CORRESPONDENT, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: I think that you set up the principal nightly -- nicely. I think that as in your case, people can take a turn through the revolving door. A turn and decide to shift their career, shift their lives, and their livelihoods that makes every sense.</p><p>The question here is, the particular, and there's problematic on two grounds.</p><p>AVLON: OK.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: It's hard to know which way to start first. Let's go first to CNN. CNN hasn't expressly said why made this hire in a way that's clear to the public. They haven't really conveyed it to their own staff.</p><p>I mean, your colleagues here at CNN have raised this question with me with other people and said why is this happening? What is the justification and why are there such questions?</p><p>It's her affiliations not simply as a partisan figure. CBS hired, I believe, a Republican figure as its political director not so long ago. It's a question of the attitude toward the press.</p><p>The Trump administration, her boss at the Department of Justice. Jeff Sessions also antipathetic to what the press does in his rhetoric, and how he approaches it or, at least, how he talked about approaching it. It seems to me as though, she needs to come forward and CNN needs to come forward and say I am embracing journalism and this is why.</p><p>AVLON: So just to boil it down, you think the key difference is that there's a difference with the Trump administration, and how its treated the press that's breaks president with all previous presidents, and that's why there's a higher standard of scrutiny you've been.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: Given that, I think CNN needs to own this in a clearer way, in a more expressed way. Kudos for addressing it on a show like this, but nonetheless, address it with the public, say why this decision is the right decision.</p><p>AVLON: Well, let's continue to do that. S.E., you obviously are card-carrying conservative, a critic of the Trump administration. But in other networks. What's your perspective on what David just said in this hire?</p><p>CUPP: Well, a couple of things. I know Sarah for a long time, and I've worked with her in all of her capacities when she was at the House, when she was at the DOJ when she was running a presidential campaign, and she's a professional. She is very smart, lovely to work with, she's loyal. She'll be good at this job as she's been good at all of her jobs, frankly.</p><p>But I think the problem was, to David's point, the confusion. There was internal confusion about what she would be doing. I'm glad that you, John, addressed that.</p><p>The sense I got internally was not so much this person is coming from the Trump administration, but what will she be doing? Will she be overseeing our editorial decisions? And once that was cleared up, I think a lot of the confusion and the concern went away.</p><p>But, let's be clear, having those concerns is healthy. It's appropriate. I wish that of all of the transitions between administrations and journalism going in both directions, I wish that was met with the same healthy concern every time.</p><p>For journalists to be concerned about someone coming from the administration into a journalism outfit is appropriate. And we just have to watch and let her do her job and have a chance, and see if she can do this. I believe she can.</p><p>[11:46:04] AVLON: And David, look, I mean, ideally, public service and journalism are two sides of the same coin, right?</p><p>I mean, it's about you care about civic debates presumably. But there obviously is a different tone and tenor with this administration. Let me clear up some of the things that both of you have raised.</p><p>I mean, the expectation is that she will play a coordinating role across digital and T.V. so that the right-hand knows what the left hand is doing. And I think the larger question and the larger opportunity is the role of ideological diversity in newsrooms.</p><p>Talk a lot about diversity as we should. But don't you feel that ideological diversity is an important asset to a news organization that's not simply trying to play to the base and compound the problem with polarized media?</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: So, this is in some ways a larger version of the problem that I have with the way in which the cable news employs partisan figures as paid commentators for the networks as opposed to saying we have somebody who is an outside voice for partisan thing.</p><p>You know, it's like you have on CNN or an MSNBC or Fox, you know, team right, team left, team Trump, team anti-Trump, and they're in house. And that's weird and premature who is the loyalty to?</p><p>I am in favor of ideological diversity and geographical diversity backgrounds. Economic, all the kinds of different ways of backgrounds and ways of life that's helped to flow together to form a larger understanding of the tapestry of America.</p><p>AVLON: Right.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: That's really important. On the other hand, if what her role is and we just don't know, it has been articulated is simply to say, at the table, I'm going to represent the views of those who have been Trump world, including those who were hostile to what journalism stands for, that's a problem.</p><p>If she comes out and embraces journalism and says this is my future and my life, you can see a different path for her.</p><p>AVLON: S.E., I see you're shaking your head.</p><p>CUPP: Yes, that's not going to be her job. Her job is not going to be to represent or even speak for the administration. But I will say as a conservative, CNN's interest in having a diversity of views, and also backgrounds is a really good thing.</p><p>The fact that she's -- you know, Texan who's worked in Republican -- a Republican administration, for Republican members of the House, a Republican presidential candidate, also, famously though, defended Elena Kagan in the Obama administration to the detriment of her fandom among Republicans. This is all a good thing.</p><p>Her job is going to be coordinating -- as you said, John, digital and T.V. She is not there to be a Trump spokesperson. But we are lucky as a journalism outfit to have someone from that environment. And we'd be doing ourselves a disservice if we decided to just ban people from this administration who might otherwise be qualified on having that perspective as part of our journalism outfit, can only help us.</p><p>FOLKENFLIK: You know, a got her (INAUDIBLE). It can't just be that you hire people from politics for political diversity, there are point of view journalists who coming through -- you know, combat conservatism through journalism itself. What I want to hear from CNN and from Flores herself is a commitment to journalism and journalistic principles that you aren't hearing from anybody, really in major positions in the Trump administration.</p><p>AVLON: That is certainly, I think consistent with the mission of CNN. And I will say, there's a benefit to having people understand the politics and practice as well, as just theory. But this is an important clarifying conversation that a lot of debate.</p><p>And I want to thank you, David. Congratulations on the new baby. And S.E., congratulations on everything. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>CUPP: Thanks.</p><p>AVLON: All right. Now, here's \"NEW DAY\" co-host Alisyn Camerota on her favorite journalism movies.</p><p>[11:49:36] ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: OK, my favorite journalism movies are in this order. Number one, Broadcast News, because I love the Holly Hunter character who, of course, we all know is Susan Zirinsky who has just become the first female president of CBS News. So, I love her story and I love that movie.</p><p>Number two, the one that really is basically a documentary, Anchorman, who among us doesn't know a guy in T.V. news just like that. And number three, To Die For, which is Nicole Kidman who I think perpetrates a murderer. And I feel that it sort of accurately captures the dark humor of newsrooms. You're welcome.</p><p>AVLON: Venezuela in chaos. Sources say, at least, five people are dead and 285 injured as Venezuelan security forces fought with protesters near the Colombian border this Saturday. The Colombia Committee to Protect Journalists says one reporter is among the injured.</p><p>And it's just the latest dangerous situation that reporters are facing around the globe. I'm joined by Jennifer Egan, Pulitzer-Prize winning novelist, and president of PEN America. Jennifer, thank you for joining us. At a time when so many journalists are imprisoned around the world, I think it's so important that organizations like yours are shining a light and helping people remember that they're not -- it can be locked away forever. How do you see your role?</p><p>[11:54:59] JENNIFER EGAN, PRESIDENT, PEN AMERICA: Well, the point of imprisoning a journalist is to silence that journalist, and the sense erase him or her. So, the goal at PEN America is to make that impossible by bringing world attention to these imprisoned journalists. And making it more uncomfortable to leave them in prison than to release them.</p><p>AVLON: And does it work?</p><p>EGAN: It does work sometimes. I mean, of the 42 journalists that we've honored with our freedom to write award, 37 so far have been released. And we've had some great successes and all others that were still really actively working on.</p><p>AVLON: It's a tangible sign of hope. Final quick question for you, as a novelist, you said you see society in terms of a story. Where do you see our story going in today's America?</p><p>EGAN: Well, in terms of suppressing the truth, to me it seems like the last gasp of an old order. I mean, it just doesn't work. You know, look at climate change. It comes whether you say, it doesn't exist or not. And I have a lot of faith in whatever will come next in terms of facing these problems and tackling them.

A showdown is on in the US, with security agencies demonising these privacy-protecting technologies and demanding a \"backdoor\" to them, while tech companies resist this logic.UK <person><nameText>Prime Minister David Cameron </nameText></person>has argued that there should be \"no form of communication...that we cannot read\". Meanwhile, there were rumours (now busted) of France banning the widely used ToR (the onion router), which anonymizes users by hiding the original IP address and routing traffic through several points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">End-to-end encryption became popular after Edward Snowden's <person><nameText>leaks </nameText></person>about widespread spying by the US National Security Agency . This means that data gets encrypted on one device and decrypted only when it reaches the recipient, making it technically impossible for anyone in the middle to access it.Most big tech companies have tightened their default encryption since. There is a set of new messaging tools, like Signal, CryptoCat and others, which allows users to mutually verify their keys.</p><p>\"People are far more security-aware now -not just about protecting their information from the government, but also hackers and malicious third parties,\" says Raman Jit Singh Chima, global policy director at Access Now, a digital freedom group that successfully petitioned the Obama administration to take a more considered view.</p><p>Intelligence agencies claim that these technologies give terrorists an invisibility cloak. \"But terrorists aren't looking for government-approved platforms to communicate, they'll just find other black market tech,\" says Chinmayi Arun, research director of the Centre for Communication Governance. \"In the process, citizens will get worse encryption, journalists won't be able to communicate securely with their sources.\"</p><p>Intelligence agencies create this false confrontation between national security and personal security,\" says tech analyst Nikhil Pahwa. He argues</p><p>that the link between encryption and intelligence failure is a smokescreen; the real problem, as witnessed in the Paris attacks, is that security agencies are unable to sift the signal from the noise despite the data they do have.</p><p>Others, like security consultant Akash Mahajan, argue that forcing tech companies to build a backdoor would create vulnerability -one that could also be used by others for malign ends. \"Encryption is math. Math doesn't care if you're the NSA or Daesh,\" says Mishi Choudhary of the Software Freedom Law Centre.</p><p>\"Terrorism isn't the only fact in the world. These tools are used by businesses everywhere, weakening encryption could make corporate espionage much easier,\" says Mahajan. India has stakes in this global official backlash against encryption. \"Indian banks and companies, the Paytms and Flipkarts, are the first to suffer with weak encryp</p><p>tion,\" Choudhary points out.</p><p>India has several laws, ranging from the Indian Telegraph Act to the Information Technology Act, which let central and state governments monitor private communications in the name of security or public safety. Service providers have to agree that they will open their networks to government surveillance; interception and monitoring systems exist across a range of intelligence and tax agencies. There is no judicial oversight, getting metadata is not even seen as interception.</p><p>The core problem is that \"there is no comprehensive data protection law in India, apart from scattered requirements under different statutes,\" says lawyer Shyam Divan.</p><p>The government's draft encryption policy, unveiled in September, was booed off stage because it sought to weaken standards rather than boost them. It had heavy-handed specifications on encryption algorithms, mandatory registration of encryption products, and the retention of unencrypted user information for 90 days.</p><p>Now, as the government reworks its stand on encryption, the question is which way it will respond to the global climate of opinion. \"It should learn from the mistakes of other countries, where overbroad regulation took years to fix. Undermining security standards just leaves everyone vulnerable,\" sums up Chima.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_118_14122015014068</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HKV-Y961-DXJR-H1MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

A showdown is on in the US, with security agencies demonising these privacy-protecting technologies and demanding a \"backdoor\" to them, while tech companies resist this logic.UK <person><nameText>Prime Minister David Cameron </nameText></person>has argued that there should be \"no form of communication...that we cannot read\". Meanwhile, there were rumours (now busted) of France banning the widely used ToR (the onion router), which anonymizes users by hiding the original IP address and routing traffic through several points.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">End-to-end encryption became popu ar after Edward Snowden's <person><nameText>leaks </nameText></person>about widespread spying by the US National Security Agency . This means that data gets encrypted on one device and decrypted only when it reaches the recipient, making it technically impossible for anyone in the middle to access it.Most big tech companies have tightened their default encryption since. There is a set of new messaging tools, like Signal, CryptoCat and others, which allows users to mutually verify their keys.</p><p>\"People are far more security-aware now -not just about protecting their information from the government, but also hackers and malicious third parties,\" says Raman Jit Singh Chima, global policy director at Access Now, a digital freedom group that successfully petitioned the Obama administration to take a more considered view.</p><p>Intelligence agencies claim that these technologies give terrorists an invisibility cloak. \"But terrorists aren't ooking for government-approved plat orms to communicate, they'll just find other black market tech,\" says Chinmayi Arun, research director of the Centre for Communication Governance. \"In the process, citizens will get worse encryption, journalists won't be able to communicate securely with their sources.\"</p><p>Intelligence agencies create this false confrontation between national security and personal security,\" says tech analyst Nikhil Pahwa. He argues</p><p>that the link between encryption and intelligence failure is a smokescreen; the real problem, as witnessed in the Paris attacks, is that security agencies are unable to sift the signal from the noise despite the data they do have.</p><p>Others, like security consultant Akash Mahajan, argue that forcing tech companies to build a backdoor would create vulnerability -one that could also be used by others for malign ends. \"Encryption is math. Math doesn't care if you're the NSA or Daesh,\" says Mishi Choudhary of the Software Freedom Law Centre.</p><p>\"Terrorism isn't the only fact in the world. These tools are used by businesses everywhere, weakening encryption could make corporate espionage much easier,\" says Mahajan. India has stakes in this global official backlash against encryption. \"Indian banks and companies, the Paytms and Flipkarts, are the first to suffer with weak encryp</p><p>tion,\" Choudhary points out.</p><p>India has several laws, ranging from the Indian Telegraph Act to the Information Technology Act, which let central and state governments monitor private communications in the name of security or public safety. Service providers have to agree that they will open their networks to government surveillance; interception and monitoring systems exist across a range of intelligence and tax agencies. There is no judicial oversight, getting metadata is not even seen as interception.</p><p>The core problem is that \"there is no comprehensive data protection law in India, apart from scattered requirements under different statutes,\" says lawyer Shyam Divan.</p><p>The government's draft encryption policy, unveiled in September, was booed off stage because it sought to weaken standards rather than boost them. It had heavy-handed specifications on encryption algorithms, mandatory registration of encryption products, and the retention of unencrypted user information for 90 days.</p><p>Now, as the government reworks its stand on encryption, the question is which way it will respond to the global climate of opinion. \"It should learn from the mistakes of other countries, where overbroad regulation took years to fix. Undermining security standards ust leaves everyone vulnerable,\" sums up Chima.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIEP-0_83_13122015011032</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIEP2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HKN-05B1-JB3N-T0JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382891</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.
