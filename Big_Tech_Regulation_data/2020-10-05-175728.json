Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. </p><p>And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-1d236b7318644615bc0476ce1968684b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4B-3481-JBH6-C0G5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Looking back, do you think that was actually a mistake, the attitude that was brought to the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. </p><p>And I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn. Part of what we had to learn was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves, but as the way other people saw us. We had to learn to connect with the world. We needed to assume more responsibility. We needed to compromise and accept regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. Because it was tempting, of course, this was personified perhaps by Bill Gates more than anybody else, tempting to see this sort of geeky, extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech-oriented, who really was sort of in it for the purity of developing the knowledge. But of course Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg recently isn't really like that at all. He's not just the uber-geek, he's a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit that can be made from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is that in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and they move very fast. One of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought. And I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast - the old slogan was \"move fast and break things.\" I think the new slogan is... Just to interrupt you on that point, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating system market for PCs? I think that what we learned was that we needed to think more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find in very successful tech companies, and Microsoft was among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact that you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that's the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting. If that is the place that big tech is at today, do you understand the calls being made across the political spectrum in the US right now for the breakup of the biggest companies? If we are going to name them, then it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, who of course have Google, then there would be Microsoft, than Facebook. There are people, and I'm going to quote for you, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a hopeful presidential candidate in the Democratic Party, calling for the breakup of those big companies, because she says they \"fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy.\" I do believe we need to... I'll say, strengthen the democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe you need to break companies up. I don't believe that's the best or even fastest path to restoring the power of governments, especially democratic governments elected by the public. We learn from Microsoft's own experience, that while the government in our case 20 years ago, actually pursued a break-up of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted in the end without doing that. And you can move a lot faster as a government to doing it in a different way. Let's talk about regulation, what you call guardrails in your book. The idea that you can find a way of working, private sectors, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government to develop meaningful, effective guardrails, to ensure that the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guardrails should look like, that we don't have today? I think one should start by asking what problems we want to solve, and then you create guardrails to solve each one. Certainly we look around the world today and there are plenty of technology problems that need to be solved. There are issues around privacy, there are issues around cyber-security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in, say, something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the impact that</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-f2b6fdab5d184bc989ddb354f8e18844</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X5C-SBC1-JBH6-C4KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

It was not signed a god in the mid- 90s that many people studying the tech sector refer to Microsoft as the evil empire. You were the first of these giant companies that ruthlessly exploited technology to dominate a marketplace. Looking back, do you think that was a mistake?</p><p> The attitude the table by Microsoft? We made more than our share of mistakes. I think it is an interesting story, because we had to learn, part of what we had to was to look in the mirror and see ourselves not as we wanted to see ourselves but but the way other people us. We had to learn to connect with the world, we needed to assume more responsibility, to compromise and except regulation as it was imposed on us, and in that story, I do think there are parallels for the tech sector as a whole today. It was tempting of course, this was personified by Bill Gates more than anyone else, attempting to see this geeky extraordinarily smart business leader in a new enterprise, tech oriented, who really was in it for the purity of developing the knowledge, but of course, Bill Gates wasn't really like that at all, just as Mark Zuckerberg more recently is it really like that at all. He is not just the uber gig, he is a ruthless businessman out to suck every dollar of profit he can from his dominance of the market. I would not endorse a statement that broad. What I would suggest is in the world of technology, people start companies with a great idea and then moving very fast, and one of the lessons to be learned is that while it is important to move fast, one should never move faster than the speed of thought, and I think if you look at the history of digital technology, it has had a tendency at times for companies to move fast, the old slogan was move fast and break things, and I think the new slogan... Just interrupts you for a second, do you think Microsoft was guilty of that, in its determination --in its determination to absolutely dominate and rule the operating market for PCs? I think what we learned is that we have to move more broadly. There is a singularity of focus that you often find it very successful tech companies and Microsoft would be among them. And then you reach a point where you just have to recognise that the impact you are having on others, other people in your industry, the world as a whole, is so much greater that you have to step back and internalise that, and that is the key to accepting more responsibility. Interesting, so if that's the case that big attackers act today, do you understand the calls that are being made across the political spectrum right now for the breakup of the biggest companies, and if you're going to need them, it would be Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, then it would be Microsoft, and Facebook. I am going to quote Elizabeth Warren, the hopeful democratic candidate, calling for the breakup of those companies because they fundamentally threaten the balance of power in our democracy. I do believe we need to, I will say, strengthened the Democratic side of the balance of power in democracy. I don't believe that you don't need to break companies up, I do believe that is the best fastest path to restore the power that the government, especially the Democratic governments, elected by the public, should have. We learned from Microsoft's own experience that while the government in our case, 20 years ago actually pursued a breakup of the company, it could accomplish what it wanted and needed without doing that, and you can move a lot faster as a government to do with a different way. Lets talk about the role of regulation, or as you put it in the book, guard rails, the idea that you can find a way of working, private sector, the big tech companies, working alongside the state government, to develop meaningful, effective guard rails to ensure the public is well served. Tell me what you think these guard rails should look like, so we don't have -- that we don't have today? One should start by asking what problems we want to solve and then you create guard rails to solve each one. We look around the world today, there are plenty of technology problems that need to be sold. There are issues around privacy, issues around cyber security. There are issues around the use of artificial intelligence in say something like facial recognition. There are economic issues, especially the</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-dd6673ae38eb49959ce5cd58a0943efe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X43-Y791-DY08-31X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"751\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

The piece looks at economic forces, especially the synergy of urban tech centers that works against rural areas, population decline and lower academic achievement that afflict many rural areas. Here in Virginia, the economic mantra coming from the Northam administration is \"all welcoming,\" yet in Southwest Virginia, the motto is seemingly \"only white conservative Christians need apply.\" </p><p>All of the causation enumerated in the article are true, but nowhere are experts willing to call out what to me is another major cause of rural decline: right wing, hate based religion and an often too willing embrace of ignorance. Progressive businesses want the best and brightest employees and care little about race, sexual orientation or religious belief - a mindset that is the opposite of what finds in Southwest Virginia. Here are article highlights: Can rural America be saved? There are 60 million people, almost one in five Americans, living on farms, in hamlets and in small towns across the landscape. For the last quarter century the story of these places has been one of relentless economic decline.The election of Donald Trump,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/upshot/this-election-highlighted-a-growing-rural-urban-split.html?module=inlinepowered\">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/upshot/this-election-highlighted-a-growing-rural-urban-split.html?module=inlinepowered</url> in no small degree by rural voters[2], has brought the troubles of small-town America to national attention, with an urgent question: What can be done to revive it?Rural America is getting old. The median age is 43, seven years older than city dwellers. Its productivity, defined as output per worker, is lower than urban America's. Its families have lower incomes. And its share of the population is shrinking: the United States has grown by 75 million people since 1990, but this has mostly occurred in cities and suburbs. Rural areas have lost some 3 million people.These days, economic growth bypasses rural economies. In the first four years of the recovery after the 2008 recession, counties with fewer than 100,000 people lost 17,500 businesses, according to the Economic Innovation Group. By contrast, counties with more than 1 million residents added, altogether, 99,000 firms. By 2017, the largest metropolitan areas had almost 10 percent more jobs than they did at the start of the financial crisis. Rural areas still had fewer.The Economic Innovation Group measures 'distress'[3]as a combination of data ranging from joblessness and poverty to abandoned homes and educational attainment. Since the 1990s, there has been an 'intensifying ruralization of distress,' said John Lettieri, the group's president.[N]obody \u2014 not experts or policymakers or people in these communities \u2014 seems to know quite how to pick rural America up. States, municipalities and the federal government have spent billions to draw jobs and prosperity to stagnant rural areas. But they haven't yet figured out how to hitch this vast swath of the country to the tech-heavy economy[4] that is flourishing in America's cities.[F]actory jobs can no longer keep small-town America afloat. Even after a robust eight-year growth spell, there are fewer than 13 million workers in manufacturing across the entire economy. Robots and workers in China put together most of the manufactured goods that Americans buy, and the high-tech industries powering the economy today don't have much need for the cheap labor that rural communities contributed to America's industrial past. They mostly need highly educated workers. They find those most easily in big cities, not in small towns.In a report published in November[5], Mark Muro, William Galston and Clara Hendrickson of the Brookings Institution laid out a portfolio of ideas to rescue the substantial swath of the country that they identify as 'left behind.' They identify critical shortages bedeviling declining communities: workers with digital skills, broadband connections, capital. And they have plans to address them: I.T. training and education initiatives[6], regulatory changes to boost lending to small businesses, incentives to invest in broadband.Wisely, they suggest that any federal government effort must choose its targets carefully. Better to focus on middle-sized places that are near big tech hubs and have some critical infrastructure, rather than scatter assistance all over the landscape. . . . . however, even the authors concede that they may not be up to the task. 'I don't know if these ideas are going to work,' Mr. Galston acknowledged when I pressed him on the issue. 'But it is worth making the effort.'This is the inescapable reality of agglomeration, one of the most powerful forces shaping the American economy over the last three decades. Innovative companies choose to locate where other successful, innovative companies are. That's where they can find lots of highly skilled workers. . . . . This dynamic feeds on itself, drawing more high-tech firms and highly skilled workers to where they already are.In hindsight, no amount of tax incentives would have convinced Amazon to expand in a medium-sized city such as Columbus, Ohio, rather than Northern Virginia and Queens,[7]which sit in some of the largest pools of talent in the country. If even medium-sized cities find it difficult to compete, what are the odds that, say, a small town like Amory, Miss., where 14 percent of adults have a bachelor's degree and a quarter of its 2,500 workers work in small-scale manufacturing, have a chance to attract well-paid tech jobs?What if nothing really works? Is there really no option but to do nothing and, as some have suggested, return depopulated parts of rural America to the bison?Instead of so-called place-based policies to revitalize small towns, why not help their residents take advantage of opportunities where the opportunities are? Geographic mobility hit a historical low in 2017, when only 11 percent of Americans picked up shop and moved \u2014 half the rate of 1951. One of the key reasons is that housing in the prosperous cities that offer the most opportunities has become too expensive.[T]he costs of rural poverty are looming over American society. Think of the opioid addiction taking over rural America, of the spike in crime, of the wasted human resources in places where only a third of adults hold a job.And if today's polarized politics are noxious, what might they look like in a country perpetually divided between diverse, prosperous liberal cities and a largely white rural America in decline? As Mr. Galston warned: 'Think through the political consequences of saying to a substantial portion of Americans, which is even more substantial in political terms, 'We think you're toast.'\u2009'The distress of 50 million Americans should concern everyone. Powerful economic forces are arrayed against rural America and, so far, efforts to turn it around have failed. Not every small town can be a tech hub, nor should it be. But that can't be the only answer.The irony, of course, is that the funds used by state and federal programs trying to revitalize rural areas come from the the diverse urban areas and the very people that so many rural voters view with contempt or worse.

In fact, new players and technologies have brought the financial industry to a crossroad, and it would not be surprising to see some legacy financial companies suffer the same fate as Kodak, once the world leader in photography. To navigate the road ahead, policymakers must ensure a level playing field that is suitable for new products and business models, while minimizing the risk that disruption becomes destructive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fintech startups benefit from cost-effective cloud-based information technology (IT) services, an absence of legacy IT costs, and adaptable business models. And as later entrants to the market, they can learn from the mistakes of incumbents and their predecessors. This explains why startups have been making deep inroads into services that boost financial inclusion, such as peer-to-peer lending and mobile remittances and payments.</p><p>But startups are also facing steep competition from the big tech companies, which have advantages of their own: deep IT expertise, large customer bases, and easy access to detailed data. Combined with a customer-centric approach, these advantages have enabled big tech companies to offer new forms of financial services. For example, Chinese technology giant Tencent has included user-friendly payment options in its instant messaging app, WeChat, while Amazon offers credit lines for merchants using its online marketplace. In this way, the big tech companies can usually operate with fewer regulatory constraints than traditional financial institutions would face.</p><p>Financial market players of all stripes are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for applications ranging from customer interaction to regulatory compliance. In particular, the blockchain distributed ledger technology underlying crypto-assets such as Bitcoin has generated a lot of hype. But while blockchain does hold promise for applications such as trade finance and remittances, it has yet to be widely adopted for payments or by mainstream institutions.</p><p>The big danger now is that fintech may upset business models that serve the greater good without providing viable alternatives. In response to the growing competition they face from Silicon Valley, traditional banks may take more risks in order to cling to a shrinking market share. And the rush to overhaul business models, or to adopt unfamiliar and rapidly evolving technologies, may weaken internal processes, creating another source of potential loss.</p><p>Moreover, financial services could become even more concentrated among a few too-big-to-fail companies, owing to the high costs of running the tech race, the network efficiencies available to larger companies with lots of customers, and the magnetic pull of popular payment solutions.</p><p>Another problem is the technology itself. AI and machine learning could be destabilizing if applied in ways that encourage herd behavior among investors, raising the likelihood of \"flash crashes\". And the black-box nature of these technologies makes it much harder for humans to intervene if things go wrong.</p><p>More broadly, the rapid rollout of new technologies gives lower-skill workers little time to adapt, and may ultimately cost some of them their jobs. Individuals might gain as consumers, but lose as employees. The balance of these two effects will differ across segments of society, potentially leading to greater economic inequality.</p><p>As for crypto-assets, it is hard to see any benefit in them at all. They lack the basic properties of money, are prone to volatile valuations and manipulation, and are extraordinarily energy intensive. Their opacity raises consumer-and investor-protection issues and opens the door for tax evasion and money laundering. Moreover, crypto-assets have been piggybacking on the trust that the traditional financial system has earned over the course of many years. A loss of confidence in crypto-assets could thus erode confidence in the broader financial system.</p><p>To contain the risks associated with innovation, policymakers, regulators and supervisors will need to be as creative, nimble and tech-savvy as the new players. They should consider creating innovation hubs to bring entrepreneurs and incumbents together, as well as \"regulatory sandboxes\" that allow innovators to test new technologies and products in a safe environment. Either measure would help policymakers stay informed about the evolving landscape.</p><p>To prevent regulatory arbitrage, rule-makers should follow the maxim of \"same risk, same regulation\". Entities vying for similar customers or offering similar financial services must follow the same rules regardless of where they are based. Setting clear regulatory boundaries reduces uncertainty and the risk that innovators will move into the shadows. But prudential authorities must also monitor financial institutions' exposure to companies and products that fall outside the regulated perimeter - a task that will require new sources of knowledge and data.</p><p>In the crypto world, \"same risk, same regulation\" means that companies raising funds through \"initial coin offerings\" should face the same standards and scrutiny as those offering shares. Likewise, the big tech companies should not enjoy an undue advantage when it comes to data access and sharing. Existing data-privacy codes have too many loopholes for unethical practices, and thus need to be reformed. The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation represents a step in the right direction. The question that policymakers need to keep in mind is: How much privacy one should give up in order to access financial services?</p><p>Because innovation knows no boundaries, \"same risk, same regulation\" must also apply across countries. Domestic and international coordination among prudential, legal, tax, accounting and telecommunications authorities is essential. Governments must also anticipate the impact of innovation on users and workers, not least by introducing training programs so that people will have the skills needed to keep up with the pace of change.</p><p>The opportunities and challenges posed by financial innovation are clear. The policy responses must address both.</p><p>The author, governor of the Bank of Mexico from 2010 to 2017, is general manager of the Bank for International Settlements.</p><p>Project Syndicate</p><p>(China Daily 12/25/2018 page9)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/71/154569890606.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/498/1493/71/154569890606.jpg</url></p><p>a41f726719b21d8bc4a320.jpg<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDLY-133823934</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V1X-7W41-F11P-X28S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1133\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 China Daily Information.

But innovation can also be destructive if it is not managed properly, and financial innovation (fintech) is no exception.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New technologies developed by fintech startups and the major Silicon Valley companies are making banking and financial services more efficient and accessible than ever before. In fact, new players and technologies have brought the financial industry to a crossroad, and it would not be surprising to see some legacy financial companies suffer the same fate as Kodak, once the world leader in photography. To navigate the road ahead, policymakers must ensure a level playing field that is suitable for new products and business models, while minimizing the risk that disruption becomes destructive.</p><p>Fintech startups benefit from cost-effective cloud-based information technology (IT) services, an absence of legacy IT costs, and adaptable business models. And as later entrants to the market, they can learn from the mistakes of incumbents and their predecessors. This explains why startups have been making deep inroads into services that boost financial inclusion, such as peer-to-peer lending and mobile remittances and payments.</p><p>But startups are also facing steep competition from the big tech companies, which have advantages of their own: deep IT expertise, large customer bases, and easy access to detailed data. Combined with a customer-centric approach, these advantages have enabled big tech companies to offer new forms of financial services. For example, Chinese technology giant Tencent has included user-friendly payment options in its instant messaging app, WeChat, while Amazon offers credit lines for merchants using its online marketplace. In this way, the big tech companies can usually operate with fewer regulatory constraints than traditional financial institutions would face.</p><p>Financial market players of all stripes are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning for applications ranging from customer interaction to regulatory compliance. In particular, the blockchain distributed ledger technology underlying crypto-assets such as Bitcoin has generated a lot of hype. But while blockchain does hold promise for applications such as trade finance and remittances, it has yet to be widely adopted for payments or by mainstream institutions.</p><p>The big danger now is that fintech may upset business models that serve the greater good without providing viable alternatives. In response to the growing competition they face from Silicon Valley, traditional banks may take more risks in order to cling to a shrinking market share. And the rush to overhaul business models, or to adopt unfamiliar and rapidly evolving technologies, may weaken internal processes, creating another source of potential loss.</p><p>Moreover, financial services could become even more concentrated among a few too-big-to-fail companies, owing to the high costs of running the tech race, the network efficiencies available to larger companies with lots of customers, and the magnetic pull of popular payment solutions.</p><p>Another problem is the technology itself. AI and machine learning could be destabilizing if applied in ways that encourage herd behavior among investors, raising the likelihood of \"flash crashes\". And the black-box nature of these technologies makes it much harder for humans to intervene if things go wrong.</p><p>More broadly, the rapid rollout of new technologies gives lower-skill workers little time to adapt, and may ultimately cost some of them their jobs. Individuals might gain as consumers, but lose as employees. The balance of these two effects will differ across segments of society, potentially leading to greater economic inequality.</p><p>As for crypto-assets, it is hard to see any benefit in them at all. They lack the basic properties of money, are prone to volatile valuations and manipulation, and are extraordinarily energy intensive. Their opacity raises consumer-and investor-protection issues and opens the door for tax evasion and money laundering. Moreover, crypto-assets have been piggybacking on the trust that the traditional financial system has earned over the course of many years. A loss of confidence in crypto-assets could thus erode confidence in the broader financial system.</p><p>To contain the risks associated with innovation, policymakers, regulators and supervisors will need to be as creative, nimble and tech-savvy as the new players. They should consider creating innovation hubs to bring entrepreneurs and incumbents together, as well as \"regulatory sandboxes\" that allow innovators to test new technologies and products in a safe environment. Either measure would help policymakers stay informed about the evolving landscape.</p><p>To prevent regulatory arbitrage, rule-makers should follow the maxim of \"same risk, same regulation\".

IsoMetrix's John Castner details why companies need to stop focusing on predictive analytics and instead prioritize removing a siloed risk management approach to deal with the impact of COVID-19.As industries push to leverage technology, in today's COVID-19 world, many are looking for the next generation of GRC technology to integrate predictive analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). However, many have overlooked the challenges we still need to overcome to apply these use cases to GRC technology. Right now, businesses are under a time crunch to understand, manage and mitigate the impact of COVID-19. One failed control or one materialized risk could have ripple effects impacting stakeholders and the bottom line. By lacking a proper risk management infrastructure, it is difficult to understand the impact of existing risks and the emerging risks caused by COVID-19. Many hope that AI can help them understand how COVID-19 is impacting their bottom line. </p><p>However, to date, predicting the unpredictable has proven difficult. Before thinking about predictive analytics, companies should focus their efforts on integrating GRC data across the entire business. This starts with removing the silos between a company's financial, environmental, health, safety and social disciplines. After this critical step, companies can add HR, enterprise resource planning (ERP) and other systems into the data pipeline to gain a more holistic view of the risk landscape. In risk management terms, COVID-19 now sits on most companies' enterprise risk register, and the impact and consequences have also manifested at the operational level. The actual impact of COVID-19 can change regularly. Without continuously reviewing the core risk factors - such as the spread of COVID-19 throughout a business - and continuously monitoring and re-assessing causes, controls and safeguards, companies will have a difficult time understanding the day-to-day risks - let alone be able to use AI to predict an unwanted event. Additionally, a siloed approach to risk management makes it impossible to make the connections between the different areas of your business. For a business to leverage the power of AI in a GRC solution, it needs an infrastructure to implement risk data across each business unit so it can clearly link enterprise risk. This comprehensive view of the risk environment will help businesses leverage GRC platforms and move closer to predicting unwanted incidents.Handling the 'New Normal' with GRC TechnologyChange is a part of business, but rarely does it happen as quickly as it did in early 2020 due to COVID-19. Over the past six months, governments have created new regulations and guidance that continues to change. However, many software solutions that aim to assist in managing this regulatory change don't help companies actually manage their broader risks. Thus, companies need to also find the connections between compliance and risk management, which is where GRC solutions thrive. The problem is that traditional approaches to risk management create more challenges than solutions. According to Forrester and Disaster Recovery Journal, 51 percent of organizations are still using ad hoc tools and methods to manage business continuity and risk management. This traditional approach doesn't provide the speed, scale and agility needed to keep up with today's business environment, particularly in the time of COVID-19. Businesses need GRC context quickly and efficiently. What was the norm yesterday may not be the norm today. To get ahead of these ever-evolving risks, businesses need to start leveraging technology as a tool to help guide business decisions.Creating Cross-Office SynergyIn traditional risk management approaches, businesses conduct risk assessments every six months to a year, and those risks are reassessed periodically to create the next year's risk register. However, this approach isn't working in the era of COVID-19. Risk management approaches[1] need to be consistent and agile. This means GRC technology needs to be agile enough to allow for continual monitoring to help businesses implement a risk approach that can handle ever-evolving risks. With most companies now working remotely, there is a plethora of emerging risks businesses must consider. Manually tracking these and doing so in a traditional risk management approach puts the business itself at risk, as well as its people. These emerging risks also necessitate the move to an integrated risk management approach in order to understand the interconnected risks, or the 'golden threads,' those links between people, processes, risks, controls and events. Not understanding these golden threads causes different departments to duplicate efforts, increasing the time it takes to respond to incidents. For example, if an employee tests positive for COVID-19, the social, safety, health, HR and legal teams have to execute a unified response plan. Without an integrated infrastructure in place, these departments could repeatedly contact the same stakeholder. Siloed approaches may also create gaps in communication due to misidentified or unclear ownership. In the case of the employee with COVID-19, the team could forget to notify a critical stakeholder group, such as third-party contractors. Without notice, the third-party contractors could come on-site and risk contracting the virus. This could result in litigation and financial damage for putting the contractors at risk. In a sense, what COVID-19 has done is force companies to address these types of gaps in their existing processes and systems.Digital Risk Ecosystems, Analytics and COVID-19While an ever-changing landscape is the norm in the time of COVID-19, there is no doubt that there will be a plethora of opportunities to leverage from the lessons learned. From a pure risk management perspective, COVID-19 will create a shift to more regular risk and control monitoring. In the past, a lack of data has acted as a barrier to predicting unwanted events in the environmental, health and safety realm. Through continuous monitoring, businesses can remove their data barrier and increase the amount of data they're collecting to better understand the risk environment. COVID-19 has put health and safety at the forefront at the employee, customer and community level. For businesses to operate and manage this new type of risk, they have to leverage the power of technology. Fortunately, given the proliferation of software tools to help companies manage COVID-19 and the return to work, options are plenty. The truth is, there is no single technology solution that gives companies a holistic view of risks, no matter how integrated that company may be. Even companies that have already broken down the traditional silos still have a technology landscape that is either immature or has a myriad of best-of-breed solutions that solve specific problems for each department. Thus, it is still a challenge for companies to leverage all the information they capture to create a 360-degree view of risks. This makes it even more difficult to implement predictive analytics into GRC technology. Therefore, leading companies are finding ways to not only create an integrated business, but also support the business with an integrated technology landscape. These companies are pulling data from GRC platforms, asset management systems, ERPs and many other solutions, pushing them into data warehouses and then leveraging corporate analytics tools to make key business decisions. This digital risk ecosystem is the technical realization of an integrated risk management approach.If Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast, then Technology is the Fork and KnifeTo actually reap the benefits of GRC technology, businesses must integrate GRC tech into their larger operational strategy. Proper integration with HR, ERP and environment, health, and safety (EHS) systems incorporates risk management processes into businesses' strategic objectives. One outcome of COVID-19 is that it has encouraged businesses to adopt technology where they were previously resistant to do so. Government organizations that didn't allow remote work now do everything remotely. Restaurants no longer hand out menus; instead, you scan the menu using your phone. Going to work at many places means using an app to self-screen in order to enter the facility. Want 'evidence' that technology is the key to business success going forward? Look no further than the fact that the S&amp;#38;P 500 has set a record amidst COVID-19. What drove that? Big Tech. The challenge going forward with GRC technology is the question around who it serves: executives or employees. To successfully integrate GRC technology, businesses need to create an organizational culture around GRC technology. This may sound simple, but often, employees' lack of buy-in leads to a platform's demise. Knowing that management is prioritizing the GRC platform's success, employees may be hesitant to share feedback as it could be negatively perceived. However, lacking an understanding of the platform leads to incomplete tasks or missing data. Not inserting that data changes how GRC platforms identify risky events. Educating employees on the importance of GRC platforms provides more context and encourages feedback. Empowering the people closest to the project streamlines its implementation and creates more accurate data to drive key business decisions. Successfully integrating GRC platforms into every business unit gives the executive team a comprehensive overview of people's movement, training, attendance and more. This gives GRC platforms the data to determine what could go wrong and what could go right. If used effectively, technology influences culture, culture influences technology and businesses are more apt to achieve their strategic objectives. If data is the key to prediction and analytics, then a technology-focused organizational culture will move businesses closer to being able to leverage the power of AI and predictive analytics. Looking at where things are today, there's still a long way to go before GRC technology platforms can truly leverage AI. So, let's not get ahead of ourselves - let's focus on what really matters in terms of leveraging GRC technology: breaking down the siloed nature of business and risk management.

Kamala Harris (D-CA), who is increasingly seeking to carve out an ideological lane separate from the most progressive Democrats running for president, laid out a new plan Monday for providing Medicare for all Americans, with a twist that stops short of the complete overhaul of the health insurance system that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) 'has proposed.' \"Instead of completely replacing private coverage with a government-run, single-payer system based on traditional Medicare, Ms. Harris would allow people to choose plans modeled on Medicare Advantage, which would be run not by the government but by private insurers. More than one-third of the Medicare population already chooses Medicare Advantage, which offers extra benefits and limits out-of-pocket costs but is strict about which doctors and hospitals enrollees can use. \"Her plan would also allow people to choose a somewhat expanded version of traditional, government-run Medicare. </p><p>But by preserving a major role for private insurersand calling for a 10-year phase-in period instead of the four-year transition that Mr. Sanders envisionsit could go a long way toward neutralizing fierce opposition from insurance companies, many of which have profited handsomely from Medicare Advantage plans.\" Harris: Essentially, we would allow private insurance to offer a plan in the Medicare system, but they will be subject to strict requirements to ensure it lowers costs and expands services. If they want to play by our rules, they can be in the system. If not, they have to get out. (New York Times)  At her strongest ... Harris is forceful and pragmatic. She elates crowds in Iowa and South Carolina with her denunciations of President Trump, and spells out her policy agendaon matters like restricting gun sales, reducing prescription drug prices and giving tax benefits to rentersin precise terms. Then there is another version of Ms. Harris: unsteady when addressing litmus-test questionsthe hypothetical or intensely ideological queries like whether a single-payer system should void all private insurance, or whether a convicted terrorist should be able to vote from prison. She is intensely resistant, sometimes to the point of visible discomfort, to her own partys thirst for policies that would redraw the American economy and system of government. As a result, she has found herself in a potent but unpredictable position: Democratic voters have thrilled to her as a messenger, yet the content of her message remains a work in progress.  A review of Ms. Harriss policies in the 2020 race, as well as her public writings and interviews with more than a dozen of her current and former colleagues and allies, generated a portrait of her as a leader with a clear approach to governing. She sees it as an enterprise of writing careful rules and enforcing them with determination, more than engineering transformational social change. Five associates observed, in near-identical language, that she is not ideological. (New York Times) BIDEN.  Former Vice President Joe Bidens promise on job-based [health care] coverage, which almost 160 million Americans use, underscores the risks of positioning himself as the health overhauls chief defender. Fully embracing the health law and pledging to expand it also means exposing Biden to attacks from all sides: from the left that wants more than what Biden is offering; from the right that loathes the law in any form; and from the middle, where voters remain skeptical about the nations complex and expensive health care system. Biden is at the center of a broader Democratic divide over the future of health care that will likely be an animating issue at this weeks primary debate in Detroit.  the campaign says his position reflects voters slow embrace of the 2010 law, while acknowledging voters concerns about the cost and consequences of a single-payer, government health insurance system and their distrust of private insurers and the pharmaceutical industry. (AP) As Mr. Biden prepares for the next debate  which will include a rematch with Ms. Harris, he and his advisers are grappling with how to make sure he doesnt appear so shaky, cognizant that a repeat performance could do lasting damage to his campaign and erode his advantage in the polls. ... Trump is seeking to turn Mr. Bidens age into an issue.  His unsubstantiated attacks on Mr. Biden, and more muffled disquiet from some Democratic activists, infuriate Mr. Bidens friends and advisers. As Mr. Biden prepares for the next debate, scores of his supporters have offered the same unsolicited advice to his aides: borrow from the playbook of another septuagenarian candidate, Mr. Reagan, according to campaign officials.  But Mr. Biden often says that it is fair to raise the issue  and he has sought to make light of it, even joking about challenging Mr. Trump to a push-up contest. (New York Times)  As he makes another bid for the White House, Biden  is facing criticism over his past advocacy for tough-on-crime policies, particularly his authorship of the 1994 omnibus anti-crime law that is blamed for accelerating incarceration rates, especially of black men. ... Bidens role in passing the lesser-known 1986 law and creating the crack-powder disparity reveals how he grappled with policies years earlier that would affect the black community.  An examination of Bidens work on a half-dozen criminal justice bills found that his legislation included liberal priorities but also broadly served to push federal criminal policy to the right in response to a surge of violent crime.  On the campaign trail, Biden has at times played down the power he wielded or suggested he did not support policies that he touted as they became law, such as additional prison funding. (Washington Post) Eager to please, solicitous, emotionally vulnerable: These are elements of the public Joe Biden  simply Joe to everyone he meets  that the presidential candidate projects in formal surroundings on the stump. But this drama critic, attempting to assess the theater inherent in the race for president, also detected a bit of desperation in a man yearning for the validation that has eluded him for so long. At times, Biden reminded me of another man of the road  Arthur Millers Willy Loman, who, in Death of a Salesman, regales his sons, Biff and Happy, with stories of how well liked he is in the towns on the circuit he travels. Following Biden around on one of his own recent circuits of Iowa, I observed that the insecurity surfacing in Willy also finds expression in Biden. The way, for instance, Willy summons the idealized memory of his tycoon brother, Ben, in whose shadow hes lived, has an echo in the portrait Biden paints of the president for whom he served for eight years as vice president. Biden likes to characterize himself as an equal partner in that presidency, which comes across as, well, Willy-like exaggeration. Thinking about it less cynically, though, you cannot come away from a public appearance by Biden and not feel his decency. It is the sense of his reliability, that hes a person to call on when you need to hear some supportive words. Even if they sound a bit canned. (Washington Post) Biden announced a slate of 91 endorsements from battleground and Super Tuesday states, earning support from elected and community leaders in Colorado, Tennessee, Utah, Florida, and Maryland. Notable endorsements: former Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena and former Sens. Jim Sasser (D-TN), Bob Graham (D-FL), and Bill Nelson (D-FL). (release)  BERNIE. By several measurespolling, fund raising, die-hard support Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) remains one of the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination. He has more cash on handnearly $27.5 millionthan any other Democrat and commands strong on-the-ground organizations in the two most politically crucial primary states: Iowa, which he barely lost four years ago, and New Hampshire, which he won handily. But hes fallen behind former Vice President Joe Biden in most state and national polls, lagged several rivals in the latest fundraising quarter and is no longer the political and cultural phenom he was four years ago. Rather, Sanders has become something considerably less buzz-worthy, just another candidate scrabbling to break from the pack of presidential hopefuls, many staking positions similarif not identicalto his own. Most have the added benefit of seeming newer and fresher. (Los Angeles Times)  A mix of long-time progressive activists and relative newcomers to Frances storied expat community, this group sees the Sanders candidacy as an opportunity to promote a political structure back home that more closely resembles the one they live under abroad. This is maybe the only time in my lifetime Ill ever see the genuine possibility of a democratic socialist becoming president of the United States, says Penny Schantz, a longtime labor activist and one of the organizers of France for Bernie. The overseas vote isnt exactly a major factor in national elections, and its unlikely to determine the Democratic nomination or the presidency. Nearly 3 million eligible American voters live overseas, according to the Federal Voting Assistance Program, a government agency. In the 2016 general election, only 208,329 total ballots were cast from abroada turnout of about 7 percent, significantly lower than the stateside rate of more than 60 percent. But for many left-leaning voters living abroad, 2016and the rise of Donald Trumpmarked a turning point. Democrats Abroad, which functions like a state party, sending 21 delegates to the Democratic National Convention on behalf of Americans living overseas, saw its global membership double in advance of the 2016 primary and then steadily increase, according to Julia Bryan, the organizations global chair. (Politico) Sanders joined diabetes patients as they drove across the border on Sunday to buy cheap insulin in Canada, highlighting his argument in favor of federally negotiated prescription drug prices.Sitting in the back of a chartered bus organized by members of advocacy group Insulin4All, Sanders spoke to families who said they go to great lengths to ration their insulin because of high U.S. costs, often putting their health at risk. (Reuters) BETO. Former Rep. Beto ORourkes (D-TX) campaign has all of the outward signs of what his run for the presidency was supposed to be and what his most devoted supporters believe it still can be. Hes collecting millions of dollars in campaign donations, has hired experienced Democratic operatives and is paying his field organizers eye-popping wages, probably the highest in the primary campaign. ORourke has quickly built a large operation in Iowa, with 11 offices scattered throughout the state, and he welcomed crowds of at least 100 during his last two town halls there. But those images belie the struggles hes facing: spending money more quickly than he is raising it, polling nationally between 1percent and 3percent in the past month, and trying to convince voters he has the experience and vision to be president. After a first debate appearance that raised alarm among his major donors, there is ever-increasing pressure on ORourke to shine at Tuesdays debate and remind Democrats why so many thought he could be a front-runner just a few months ago. (Washington Post)  ORourke is sensitive to the criticism that he is superficial and his campaign is thin on policy plans. He has released several big proposalson immigration reform, on a caregiver tax credit, on tackling structural inequity in education.\" ORourke: I talk about a $500 billion permanent education fund and $20 to $25 billion that spins off every year thats invested in addressing the gap in equity funding for majority-minority schools. Does that connect with you? I dont knowmaybe it does, maybe it doesnt. Maybe those are all abstractions and numbers.  The most succinct explanation Ive heard ORourke give of what he thinks his campaign is about came at the beginning of June, in South Carolina, when he had just a few minutes onstage to make his case at Representative Jim Clyburns fish fry.  ORourke told the crowd he was making sure that the full story of the United States of America is told to the people of the United States of Americabecause we know that when everyones story is included in our national story, it is only then that we can right the wrongs and set this country on the right path. (The Atlantic)  ORourke will return to Nevada next week for a three-day trip following the second Democratic presidential debate in Detroit. On Thursday, Beto will host a town hall at the East Las Vegas Community Center. On Saturday, Beto will deliver remarks at the AFSCME 2020 Public Service Forum before traveling to Reno for a backyard town hall. He will finish the evening with a town hall in Minden. (release)  BOOKER. Can one candidate be a lover and a fighter? Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) thinks sobut his theory could be put to the test next week. As the second Democratic primary debate nears, Booker appears ready for a primetime standoff with Biden on the biggest stage in politics, following sharp public disagreements this week. In recent days, Booker has called Biden an architect of mass incarceration for spearheading the 1994 crime bill, while the Biden campaign countered that the Newark Police Department under Booker was a civil rights nightmare. The back-and-forth has all but guaranteed that Booker and Biden will continue to hash out their disagreements on the debate stage this week. What's less clear, however, is who will come out on top. (CNN)  Booker announced he has met the requirements set by the DNC to participate in the third and fourth Democratic primary debates. (release)  Jon Bon Jovi and his wife, Dorothea, are set to host a fundraiser for presidential hopeful Cory Booker at their Hamptons mansion next month. Tickets for the East Hampton soiree on August 18 range from $1,000 per personwhich includes entrance to a late-afternoon cocktail receptionall the way up to $15,000 for the host committee, which comes with access to the cocktail reception and dinner, plus a photo with Booker and Bon Jovi. (New York Post)  BULLOCK. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) wrote an op-ed outlining his ideas for making higher-education more accessible ahead of the debate stage on Wednesday: \"The fact is, while promises of free college and total loan forgiveness make for flashy press releases, they aren't serious solutions for most people's daily lives.  While most states were balancing their budgets on the backs of students, I froze college tuition by investing more into higher education. As a result, we have the fourth lowest in-state tuition and fees in the nation. We ensured our two-year colleges offer robust opportunities for apprenticeships and credentials, in addition to degrees, to open pathways to good jobs without years of school. If we can do that in Montana, we can do that in states all across the country.\" (CNN) BUTTIGIEG. As the path forward in the 2020 presidential campaign starts to narrow, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) has been trying to find support in the one segment of the Democratic base he can't seem to reach: people of color. He's likely struggling for a variety of reasons. He's young and lacks national experience. Acceptance of marriage equality and LGBTQ rights among African Americans and Latinos is growing, but isnt as high as among other groups. That could be a challenge for the openly gay Democrat. And there have been a lot of questions about his handling of the South Bend police shooting last month in which a white officer killed a black man he said was wielding a knife.  Some like his ideas but think he's not ready to take on Trump. Others think he's not done enough to stand out in a large field of candidates, many with much broader experiences and proven records. Several indicated he has to do more to earn the trust of African Americans and Latinos. (Indianapolis Star)  Buttigiegs polling numbers have remained relatively flat in recent weeks, hovering between 4 and 7 percent in most surveys. And he has started facing tougher questions during public appearances, including about his struggle to build a following among black voters and his handling of a police-involved shooting in his hometown. To be sure, Buttigieg still finds himself in a strong position. He closed out the second quarter of the year with a nearly $25 million fundraising haulthe most of any candidateand more than $22.6 million in the bank. Still, his waning momentum in the polls points to a new challenge for the 37-year-old mayor: transitioning out of his role as an ascendant newcomer and into that of an established top-tier contender.\" (The Hill)  In a crowded field, Buttigieg is one of only four Democratic candidates with experience in uniform. He would be the first presidential candidate with overseas military service elected in three decades. And he has already foreshadowed how he could wield his dog tags in a race against Trump, who used medical deferments to avoid service in Vietnam.  Sitting down with a recruiter came after years of uncertainty about his willingness to join a war on terrorism that began one September morning in 2001 as he overslept in his freshman dorm. He was already a student of history and Arabic, and the 9/11 attacks instantly made the possibility of fighting feel more personal, Buttigieg said in an interview.  It was only after Barack Obama was elected, and just months before Buttigieg would launch his own political career, that he finally walked into the recruiting office. Only then did he decide to join a conflict that six years earlier he had denounced from the stage of an antiwar rally. (Washington Post)  CASTRO. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D) rebuked Trumps recent asylum agreement with the Guatemalan government, saying it would put asylum seekers in greater danger, on CBSs Face the Nation. Castro: \"You're going to now ensure that more of those people who are desperate, who are fleeing desperate circumstances, end up dead. (CBS News) Though Castro enjoyed an initial surge in fundraising after the first debate, he remains buried in most polls at around 1%. That's off the pace needed to get a critical invite to the next round of debates in September at Texas Southern University in Houston. Analysts say Castro must command the stage and somehow connect with Democrats watching on television or catching up through the later news coverage. (Dallas Morning News)  DELANEY. Former Rep. John Delaney (D-MD) released his intention to institute a mandatory national service plan as president, calling for big transformational change, in an attempt to restore our sense of shared purpose. While several 2020 candidates have proposed national service initiatives associated with paying college tuition or job training programs, Delaney's ambitious proposal, which would provide up to three years of free college tuition for those who participate in public service projects, is the first to mandate youth participation in service. The proposal adheres closely to his initial national service plan, released in April, which offered high school graduates the opportunity to enlist in the military, pursue community service projects, participate in infrastructure apprenticeships or join a newly-formed ClimateCorps  But instead of offering voluntary service, it would be compulsory for all Americans upon high school graduation or upon turning 18. (CNN) GABBARD. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) is a proud veteran, but one who harshly attacks U.S. military operations. She joined Republicans in criticizing President Barack Obama for not using the term Islamic in condemning terrorism. She has downplayed Robert S. Mueller IIIs report into Russian interference in the 2016 election and has resisted calls to impeach President Trump. Yet, the congresswoman has attracted more than 100,000 donors so far in her bid to become the Democratic presidential nominee. If Gabbards approach doesnt fit into a traditional Democratic worldview, it in many ways matches this political moment: fractured, restless, sometimes untethered to either side of the left-right divide. Although she has struggled in the polls, Gabbard appears to embody a desire by some voters to break out of long-standing categories. Her core message, that the United States needs to stop trying to police the world, helped her win enough backing to qualify for the first Democratic primary debate. Gabbard also will appear in the second faceoff later this week, and she has attracted supporters from the far left to the far rightan impassioned lot who see her as the only person in the field speaking truth. (Washington Post)  GILLIBRAND. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) \"accused some of her fellow Democratic candidates for president of not supporting women who work outside the home on Thursday, her most pointed attempt yet to frame her struggling candidacy as the best option for women voters.\" Gillibrand: We have Democratic candidates running for president right now who do not believe necessarily that its a good idea that women work outside the home. No joke. Ms. Gillibrand did not name names, and her campaign would not say whom she was referring to. (New York Times) Meanwhile, an account on the site newspapers.com that appears to be linked to Gillibrands campaign has been gathering news articles about the former vice president's stance on the child tax credit in the '80s. (The newspaper.com account and related Twitter account appear to have been taken down after we approached the Gillibrand campaign for comment.) (Axios) INSLEE. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) is running for president as the climate change candidate. But the two-term Washington governor can credibly claim to have accomplished more than most of his peers on health care, a key issue in the 2020 campaign. He created both the nations first public option and universal long-term care benefitalbeit a limited onehas run a successful Obamacare market, and expanded reproductive rights. His administration has also pushed forward a new plan for controlling drug costs, expanded Medicaid coverage to transgender patients and added programs for school children aimed at preventing chronic diseases later in life. In another time, Inslee would be running on his health care record, his campaign said. But not now. Inslee, who is among the many Democratic presidential candidates in the crowded field struggling to crack 1 percent in the polls, said he doesnt have any second thoughts about staking his long-shot bid on tackling climate change, even if that overshadows his health policy accomplishments. (Politico) Inslee penned an op-ed about making climate change a priority: Earlier this month, in a bizarre news conference, Mr. Trump claimed that one of his priorities has been to ensure that America has the cleanest air and water in the world  ignoring his record of environmental damage. He has effectively handed the Interior Department and the Environmental Protection Agency over to the fossil fuel industry, eliminated vital environmental protections and opened our coasts and public lands to drilling at the exact moment we need to stop burning fossil fuels and urgently transition to clean energy. So, why would the president give a big speech lying about his record on the environment? Because he is scared. (New York Times)  Inslee on Monday is set to make his second visit this summer to Michigan's most polluted ZIP code to unveil a new initiative centered on environmental justice. He is slated to detail his fifth proposal to combat climate change and pollution in front of the Kemeny Recreation Center on Fort Street, which neighbors the Marathon Oil Refinery. Surrounding residents have long complained about the impact of the plant's emissions on their health and quality of life.  Inslee's latest plan, Community Climate Justice, would require a new federal focus on environmental justice, hold corporate polluters accountable and call for investments in community-driven efforts to tackle inequality in the areas most impacted by climate change and pollution, according to the campaign. Among its components, the proposal calls for Equity Impact Mapping to track environmental health disparities and confront racial and environmental injustice. The proposal seeks to establish an Office of Environmental Justice within the U.S. Department of Justice to crack down on corporate polluters and a White House Council on Environmental Justice to center federal policy on equity and inclusion.  Inslee's Building a Just Future plan would guarantee at least 40% of federal investments building a clean energy economy would go to communities facing the greatest burdens of pollution, income inequities and climate impacts. The investment would be at least $1.2 trillon of the $3 trillion in federal investments called for in Inslee's previously announced Evergreen Economy Plan. (Detroit News)  RYAN. Two past Biden black supporters in South Carolina are switching their allegiance to Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) suggesting the former vice president has not consolidated his support in a state central to his 2020 plans. Fletcher Smith and Brandon Brown, who played senior roles in Biden's last presidential campaign in 2008, attended a meeting Biden held last month with a small group of African American leaders in Columbia and both told NBC News that he's neglected some relationships in the state. Smith, a former state representative, served as South Carolina co-chair for Biden's 2008 campaign and Brown served as the deputy political director. And when Brown ran unsuccessfully for Congress last year, Biden endorsed him by saying, I have known Brandon for a long time and have seen firsthand Brandon's ability to lead and desire to serve. But both are set to this weekend to endorse Ryan at events in South Carolina, where the far less well-known Ohio moderate has been quietly working to chip away support from rivals like Biden, who currently holds a large lead in the Palmetto State, according to polls. (NBC News) Ryan on Saturday announced an economic plan aimed at strengthening the middle class. The plan aims to give a boost to the manufacturing sector, double union membership and expand apprenticeship programs, in an effort to rebuild \"our forgotten cities.\"  Ryan also called to raise the minimum wage to $15, allow public sector employees the abiliity to collectively bargain and proposes an increase infrastructure funding. The Ohio congressman, whose longshot campaign has largely focused on manufacturing jobs and issues, said he would establish a U.S. Chief Manufacturing Officer who would set production goals and advocate for manufacturing workers. (The Hill) WARREN. Although Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has painted tech giants such as Google and Facebook as modern-day villains in her scathing picture of the American economy, she is emerging as a top choice for donations from tech workers, according to an analysis of campaign contributions by The Boston Globe. With her denunciations of big tech and corporate greed, Warren has tapped into simmering discontent within the industry itself about the size, power, and ethics of its companies. So, while tech executives have often resisted calls from Washington to regulate the industry, employees are contributing to Warren and Sanders, the candidates with the most aggressive positions on corporate oversight.  Looking at just the big four tech companies that she wants to break apartAmazon, Apple, Facebook, and Googleand some of their affiliates, Warren received some $144,000 in itemized donations from their employees over the first six months of the year. (Boston Globe)  Nevada assemblywoman Heidi Swank endorsed Warren. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)  Warren will travel to Toledo, Ohio to hold a town hall the night before shes on stage at the CNN Democratic Debate. On Thursday, she will hold a town hall in Tempe, Arizona - visiting her 25th state during this campaign. She will then travel to Nevada on Friday to host an organizing event in Henderson, Nevada. On Saturday, she will speak at the Public Service Forum hosted by AFSCME and HuffPost in Las Vegas. (release)  WILLIAMSON. Spiritual author Marianne Williamsons  closing arguments at the first Democratic primary debate drew mixed reactions. Some loved her performance, others mocked it. Some Republicans urged people to donate to Williamsons campaign to get her onto the next debate stage. Having learned from the first debate, when she was briefly the most-Googled candidate, Williamson said she will try again at pushing her own mixed brand of politics and spirituality when she takes part in the second Democratic presidential primary debate on July 30 in Detroit. But don't expect her message to change.\" Williamson: I hope that this time my delivery will be more aligned with my substance, she said. I dont regret the substance of anything I said, but I understand that my delivery made me vulnerable to mockery. (USA Today) In books, interviews and posts on social media, Ms. Williamson has criticized the widespread use of antidepressants  Mental health experts say comments like these can increase stigma and make people less likely to seek treatment, even if that is not the intention. In an interview with The New York Times earlier this month, Ms. Williamson ...said that she had never told anyone not to see a doctor, and that she understood clinical depression was real and sometimes necessitated medication. Williamson: I have no judgment  nor do I believe I have ever expressed any  of anyone taking antidepressants. Im happy for anyone who is finding the help they need for any ailment whatsoever. My problem is not with antidepressants per se, which clearly have and do help many people. My problem is only with their overprescription, and the practices of pharmaceutical companies when drugs are marketed in predatory ways. (New York Times) Marianne Williamson wants to create a new cabinet department focused on children: 'We need more than just educational funding'  Willamson announced on CBSs Face the Nation that she wants to create the Department of Children and Youth, differing from the Department of Education by providing a much more holistic approach toward providing the proper services for children, according to Williamson. Williamson: \"We need more than just educational funding. We need wrap-around services, we need trauma-informed education, we need to deal with the nutrition of our children, the high poverty rates, the violence in our schools.\" (The Week) Williamson wrote an op-ed in which she addresses education disparities in the United States, using a personal experience to address the issue: In the late 1990s, I lived in Grosse Pointe, an affluent suburb of Detroit, Michigan, while raising my daughter. During that time, there were people in inner city Detroit who would rent apartments ... to enable their children to attend Grosse Pointe South High School, a top-notch public school. Local governments determine the enrollment policies of children in their school. Grosse Pointe's was that your house, rented or owned, had to be your primary residence. If a child was enrolled in a school where the family was renting a second property, living with a relative, or with a parent who did not have primary custody, the district could eject them from school, extract fees from their families and potentially prosecute them for making false statements about residency. Sometimes families would get caught, and their children would be removed from the school in a humiliating fashion. I remember thinking what an injustice this was.  I promised myself that if I ever had to chance to try to fix this, I would.

Many Americans know that they are paying vastly more for far slower service than their friends in France, in the Netherlands and elsewhere in Europe. For huge numbers of us, hating the cable company transcends politics.</p><p>Faced with these realities, the ideologically motivated voices on the right do what they do so well, avoid them. You have Holman Jenkins in The Wall Street Journal writing that the big tech names \u2013 Google, Facebook, Microsoft \u2013 didn\u2019t fight against the net neutrality decision \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to be attacked by left-wing groups.\u201d</p><p>Yeah, Google, Facebook and Microsoft are so shy about defending their interests.</p><p>In the real world, these big content providers have been for \u2013 not against \u2013 net neutrality. In a letter last spring to the FCC, they warned that permitting the Internet service providers to slow traffic for some sites and speed it for others would pose \u201ca grave threat to the Internet.\u201d Did they make themselves clear?</p><p>As for the politics, Barbara van Schewick, an Internet expert at Stanford Law School, offers a wildly different analysis of why Googleand the others didn\u2019t rush into the fray. She told Wired they \u201crisked drawing the ire of the Republicans in Congress who might retaliate in various ways.\u201d</p><p>Elsewhere in the real world, the cable companies don\u2019t seem devastated by the FCC decision. The stocks of Comcast and Time Warner Cable actually rose in its wake. Their proposed merger was being held up by fears of creating a monolith that couldn\u2019t be regulated. Now there are regulations, lowering those fears and making the merger likelier.</p><p>Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have dismissed Republican claims that net neutrality will throttle the cable companies\u2019 investment in infrastructure. After all, the service providers paid $44 billion to buy a new wireless spectrum at a recent FCC auction.</p><p>\u201cThey wrote that check full knowing that this was coming,\u201d Daniel Ernst, an analyst at Hudson Square Research, said on CNBC.</p><p>Googleis pro-net neutrality, though it did have some reservations about regulating the Internet like a phone company. That\u2019s because Google\u2019s business interests have spread into broadband. But note that the head of GoogleFiber said the impending FCC decision \u201cdid not have any specific impact on (Google\u2019s) plans to build more Fiber cities.\u201d</p><p>All this solves the mystery of why Republican lawmakers did not bark after the FCC rejected their position. What\u2019s left for the pure ideologues is a bowl of kibbles about the evils of regulation and the selfless good deeds of corporations. That bowl never empties.</p><p>Creators Syndicate</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWSOBV-0304HARROP030315B972455617Z</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWSOBV2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FF0-F0K1-JC3J-X3CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">156860</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The News &amp;

October is historically a turbulent month for stocks but don't panic. Equities remain an essential tool for accomplishing long term goals like a secure retirement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, big tech stocks have accounted for the lion's share of stock gains. But virtually every hot tech company of recent years faces new challenges. Facebook and Twitter must bear added costs to ensure user privacy, police content for foreign interference and cope with additional government oversight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Along with Google, those social media enterprises' basic business model  mining user data to sell ads and information to market analytic firms  will require more self-discipline or encounter new regulation.</p><p>Amazon and Google face closer antitrust scrutiny from their treatment of business partners. Even if formal charges are not forthcoming, the public eye will compel more limits on their behavior.</p><p>Apple is casting about for new businesses, because it doesn't have any hot new gadgets and iPhones are approaching market saturation.</p><p> The stock market will have to get its growth from more traditional companies. However, with the economy expanding at three percent, instead of the two achieved during the Bush and Obama years, opportunities for mainline companies  everyone from consumer products to legacy tech companies  are improving.</p><p> Even with the lofty valuations of the glamour tech stocks, the average price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500, which accounts for about 80 percent of publicly trade U.S. equities, is a bit below its historical average of 25. With annual earnings growth for the third quarter coming in at about 19 percent, the market has reasonable potential for an upside gain of about the same amount.</p><p> Of course, uncertainty abounds about the future of the recovery.</p><p> The IMF has marked down forecasts for global growth from 3.9 to 3.7 percent, blaming trade disputes, rising interest rates and the like. The facts are most developing country businesses are hardly affected by U.S. tariffs and borrow too much when U.S. interest rates are low  they don't take into adequate account investment activity of similar businesses in other emerging economies and overcapacity results. And too much money is siphoned off by inept and corrupt government bureaucracies.</p><p> The Fed can't keep U.S. interest rates near zero forever and has been gradually raising rates  and selling mortgage-backed securities acquired during the financial crisisto fend off future inflation.</p><p> Most economists and Fed policymakers see the inflation neutral, short term interest rate a bit less than 3 percent, and that would imply only three more rate increases. If the Fed stops there, the global economy should be able to reasonably absorb it, and the U.S. recovery can go indefinitely.</p><p> Forever is a long time and inevitably, something bad happens  but when and what is virtually impossible to predict. When something does occur, a recession will result but the economy and markets will set right again  within a few years.</p><p> For most folks' savings, stocks and bonds or CDS are the only reasonable places for retirement money. The IRS has made buying rental property for investment purposes tough unless you establish an independent business  that takes much more capital and personal energy than most folks can spare.</p><p> Over the last 50 years, the S&amp;P 500 has outperformed 10-year Treasuries 2 to 1, and no compelling argument has been offered that the coming decades will be any different.</p><p> Picking the next Apple or Amazon or timing the market is virtually impossible for small investors. Virtually all should broadly diversify and invest for the long term by buying a fixed amount each month. Put most of the money you won't need over the next ten years for emergencies or big expenses like college tuition, a new roof or a down payment on house into stocks  especially retirement savings.</p><p> Once you are within 10 years of quitting, gradually move about half of your money into fixed income vehicles with maturities of less than three to five years. Throughout, invest in a low cost S&amp;P 500 index fund offered by USAA, Vanguard or a similar service. And perhaps an international index fund to smooth returns  sometimes U.S. equities do better while other times foreign stocks lead.</p><p> That's what Angela and I did, and now we only work as much as we like. Frankly, writing these columns is a treat for me.</p><p> \u2022 Peter Morici is an economist and business professor at the University of Maryland, and a national columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WTIMES-16F45C5BEEFCF228</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TJY-9PN1-JBCN-4089-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8176</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Washington Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>25 October 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In their first in-depth interview since creating the company, they sat down with TheWrap's Editor-in-Chief Sharon Waxman to discuss the state of the industry on the eve of the second annual Grill media leadership conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sloan will keynote at the conference opening, along with <person><nameText>Terry Semel, </nameText></person>CEO of Windsor Media.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Sloan was most recently the CEO and chairman of MGM, and previously built SBS Broadcasting into the second largest broadcaster in Europe. Sagansky's broad experience in television and film includes a stint as president of CBS Entertainment and as a senior executive at Sony over many years.</p><p> Sloan and Semel will speak on \"Hollywood's Future: Between Wall Street and Silicon Valley\" at the SLS Hotel on Monday evening.</p><p>  The two of you are people everybody in the industry knows. When I was looking back at the announcement of Global Eagle, it said you were looking for high growth media companies. So I put it to you, what the hell is that today?</p><p>  SLOAN: It's either a traditional media company outside the United States in a big high growth market, or a new media business in the U.S.</p><p>  SAGANSKY: There are a number of countries that are anywhere from five to eight years behind the U.S. in terms of broadband penetration, but the underlying economies -- in Asia and Latin America -- are growing double digits. So you've got a lot of traditional publishers and broadcasters growing in double digits.</p><p>  (Get more information on TheGrill here.)</p><p>  So you're going to invest outside of the country in traditional media companies, even if 10 years out those are all likely to move to new media?</p><p>  SLOAN: We've seen the future ... it's happening right here. And it's predictable. When I was doing broadcasting in Europe, I remember one of the legendary German broadcasters saying, \"Germany's future is America's present,\" and it really was that with the penetration of television. That's what that SBS story really was for me ... knowing where broadcasting was headed because I've seen that in the '80s and '90s in the U.S. and the early part of this decade in Europe.</p><p>  It doesn't concern you -- to be investing in newspapers, if we know where the newspaper story ends ... and it's probably not great?</p><p>  SAGANSKY: Newspapers aren't on our list. But there's other print that might be.</p><p>  Why aren't newspapers on your list? That's a stupid question, but I will ask it.</p><p>  SLOAN: Well, neither of us have any experience in that business, just to start with. That's a bit of a cop-out because I know that's not what you're asking us, but it would be good to be involved in something that we know something about. With Rupert Murdoch, if you ask him, what he is and does, he'll say, \"I'm a newspaper man.\" If you ask Jeff and me, I think we're international broadcast investors and maybe content producers</p><p>  Yeah -- don't leave the country.</p><p>  SLOAN: There is so much talk going on now in every studio about producing outside the U.S. I mean, I just saw something about \"The Hobbit,\" a project green-lit while I was still in MGM, which is being shot and produced in New Zealand. The New Zealand dollar was 50-55 cents per every U.S. dollar, when we were thinking about buying the currency; today, they're getting into pre-production and it's 85 cents to a U.S. dollar. And imagine adding 60 percent to a $400-$500 million budget.</p><p>  But Warner Bros. already bought foreign currency ...</p><p>SAGANSKY: No, no. I don't think so. They may have at some point ... but when it was 50 or 55 cents, we were looking at it, because Warner's was going to fund it and MGM didn't have the wherewithal to fund it, which was apparent all along. A deal wasn't done for them to fund it until MGM was going through the prepackaged bankruptcy, maybe a year or two later. I followed this, but the currency as far as I know, was never purchased. So now, they are spending the money in real time.</p><p>  SLOAN: It may be one thing to look at how much more expensive movies are by the dollar being shot out of the U.S. On the other hand, revenue of international in strong currencies gives us more dollar revenue, right? The big story right now is international box offices becoming even bigger ... and I don't know why anyone is surprised.</p><p>  The baseline on domestic is stable. But the growth is coming from the international world.</p><p>  SAGANSKY: When I started Tri-Star Pictures, maybe 35-40 percent total box office was outside of the U.S., and now routinely I think it's 75 percent. The industry average is around 63 percent -- and this is all in 20 years. The reason is not only the growth of these economies. If you look at everything from Russia, China, Brazil, Turkey, they're also getting new screens. In China, three years ago there were 1,500 screens, and many of them were old. Today there are 6,500 screens. And they're beautiful screens. Next year -- and they're all by the way 3D -- they're estimating that its going to be 10,000 screens going to 25,000-30,000 screens in the next three or four years. That's just one place.</p><p>  SLOAN: The interesting stat is that there are 200 million people in Brazil, and 80 million of them are entering the middle class. Right now, the average Brazilian sees one movie every two years, and that's why they're building screens. Imagine when you go from one admission every two\u00a0years to two admissions a year for 200 million people. I think that's 400 million more admissions and what $5? $2? $3?</p><p>  Are your investors mainly from abroad?</p><p>SLOAN: I'd say two-thirds U.S.</p><p>  SAGANSKY: We talked to all 50 media investors -- including the usual which we call \"the media mafia\" -- and we asked them, \"Where are your interests? Do you have a fund specifically for Latin America? Do you have a fund specifically for China media?\" So I think the road show was two-way. Showing what we want to do as we raise the money but also trying to read the mood of Wall Street so that we come back with an acquisition that becomes a publicly traded stock that's going to be supported.</p><p>  And what were you hearing back?</p><p>SAGANSKY: Don't buy a movie company!</p><p>  You're being serious, right?</p><p>SAGANSKY: Absolutely. First of all there are very few stand-alone movie companies.</p><p>  What are you talking about? Everyone believes Summit is for sale, DreamWorks is for sale.\u00a0Let's just clarify, you're not going to buy those?</p><p>  SLOAN: No. It's not on our radar screen. But the second most-asked question out of those meetings with institutional investors was, \"What do you think of the value of content? You have been around content, TV, movies, networks, studios and all that -- building libraries -- where is the value in that that, where are we in that cycle? That leads you to the conclusion Jeff just made about whether you should buy a TV studio. There's no right or wrong answer, it depends on where you are in the cycle.</p><p>  What was the first most-asked question?</p><p>SLOAN: Is Netflix short? (laughs)</p><p>  SAGANSKY: Content has been shredded in the last number of years because the full transition to digital hasn't happened, and yet home video has been impacted around the world.</p><p>  So where is the value of content going?</p><p>SLOAN: We think that it's come off the bottom. Subscription VOD, Netflix and the potential competitors are paying more ... this Hulu auction is going to be interesting</p><p>  Who do you think will be the likely buyer? The rumors are Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Microsoft ... the usual new media suspects ... Facebook ...</p><p>SAGANSKY: I don't really know. But I think the valuation number is going to depend on what kind of rights these three (owner) companies put into it. How long and what rights -- whether it's exclusive or inexclusive rights. At some point, the business will sail on its own bottom, and whether that's three, five, seven years, that'll be part of the negotiation. But the whole question is: Who needs it most, who is this most transformative for?</p><p>  SLOAN: The ones who need it most are the sellers. It's the studios ... the content owners who need it most to exist. The world is not going to change at Microsoft or at Google or at any of these $500 billion companies, it's the studios, the much smaller companies ...</p><p>  So you think they should keep it?</p><p>SLOAN: No, I they should make sure that something happens so there's a viable ownership. Now you've got honest agreements among the owners because no one knows what the heck is gonna happen in the new media world. They have differences in opinion, so the ownership is dysfunctional, and it's not going to be able to continue. If they can figure out a way to work together with the right ownership group, then it might be the answer to the question of, \"Who's going to be the next subscription VOD service to compete with Netflix?\"</p><p>  SAGANSKY: Right now, there's only one real buyer for the S-VOD business. It's like the word Jell-O -- when you describe an S-VOD service, you just say \"Netflix.\"</p><p>  There are a few transactional services. Steve Jobs' model for this is: I'm a middle-man, I'm going to take 30 percent, which is what they take on iTunes, and I'm going to tie up as much product as I can, but I'm not going to buy content, and I'm not going to own content, and I'm not going to get in a situation where if I pay you this, somebody else wants more, we're just going to be neutral.\"</p><p>  Now, if the big tech and social media companies want to follow that model, they have to make a big investment in content, which is unlikely. So the idea that Apple, for sure, or Google, or Facebook or Amazon, or Netflix, or any of these guys, are going to turn around one day and buy a studio seems unlikely, because they're following the Steve Jobs model right now, which is you don't have to pay for content.</p><p>  If that changes, if those guys start buying content, controlling content, controlling exclusive content, that's going to change the value of content. As long as content lives in the environment that it lives right now, with Netflix essentially non-exclusive, DVD declining, broadcast in the U.S. is kind of a little bit tired outside the U.S. -- in that environment, content value is a little bit off the floor, it's off of its lows, but not to where it was in the height of the DVD.</p><p>  In the height of the DVD boom, the consortium that bought MGM paid $5 million for that library. That is, an average library - it's bigger than any of the others, except for Warner's, but it was older. So it would kinda be in the middle in value. It's probably fallen to about $3 million, maybe 3 and a half. So the answer to the question when you buy and sell content is, where are we in that cycle?</p><p>  SLOAN: The other thing is that, if you look at the actual studio output, you would now put more value on the television library and production capability than you would on the movie capability, and that wasn't always the case.</p><p>  That was the thing that is driving these subscription services -- television, not the movies. In television, there's usually that primary window, and this is the secondary window, whereas with movies, there are so many windows. But what's interesting is that even when I started at Sony in the mid-'90s, you had to produce the movies to drag along the TV content and the music library and the old TV library.</p><p>  Now, it's reversed -- it's the TV product that the international TV broadcasters want, to do an output deal, but not always on the movie product.</p><p>  Someone with great vision would say, \"The value of content is gonna go up, this is a good time to buy.\" The guys who bought Miramax were completely convinced that the value of content was going up even though they paid what most people thought was a retail number.</p><p>  Do you think they were wrong?</p><p>SLOAN: No. I don't know. The Wall Street investors who are operating on quarterly and yearly earnings probably aren't really ready to get behind a big content play. Otherwise, I think you'd see some interesting mergers. I think you'd see MGM, Summit and Lionsgate get together, because that just makes so much sense.</p><p>  SAGANSKY: But if you felt that within a certain period of time you're going to have Netflix and Hulu and Amazon and Blockbuster, and they're all going to be bidding for streaming rights, and it was that kind of vigorous market and it was gonna happen worldwide, I think you're gonna probably say this is going to be a good time owning content. But how long is it gonna take?</p><p>  SLOAN: And the U.S. isn't the entire story, not even half the story.\u00a0 If you look at a world that you've got 50 or 60 percent broadband penetration, and streaming rights becoming valuable in Brazil, in Turkey, in Indonesia, in Russia, in India, and piracy doesn't derail it as it is already doing in Spain, China, in a lot of those places, that's probably the right time to buy libraries. So, our view is: We just want to be in the right place.</p><p>  If we're lucky enough to get into one of those high growth territories, a big one with hundreds and millions of people, with broadcasting, whether it's cable or satellite, traditional, however it is ... it'd be foolish not to try to control as much content as possible. Again, we know what the future looks like. The future looks like the U.S. -- where the fastest growing business is subscription video ... Netflix.</p><p>  But in a lot of those countries, there are limits, there are ownership issues...</p><p>SLOAN: There are a number of opportunities to distribute content over cable, over satellite, over nontraditional broadcasting all over the world that are not regulated. Italy. for example. Today all the terrestrial broadcasters are regulated ... you have to have 75 or 8 percent Italian ownership but they're transitioning to digital terrestrial. I don't know if you know what that is, you probably do - it's a juggernaut in Europe. You're taking an over-the-air broadcasting signal and splitting digitally three, four, five, six channels. As Italy transitions so that you can broadcast over digital terrestrial, you don't need a license.</p><p>  SAGANSKY: and the reason is because there's going to be a profusion of channels, so they feel, hey it's not just gonna be three players.</p><p>  SLOAN: Getting a foothold in one of these territories, there are always regulatory issues, particularly if you're a traditional broadcasting. The premise here is if we can get into a high-growth market, and we can get away to deliver the content, invest in the content and be there when broad brand penetrations reach critical mass ...</p><p>  What's your window for that?</p><p>SLOAN: Five years. In Turkey, I am convinced that that market is going to double in the next four to five years, and they're going to get the 40 or 50 percent broadband penetration. So that's going to put in some subscription VOD potential, right? And cable is exploding and there are more and more subscribers. There are two viable platforms. Turkey may be too small for Jeff and I, we're talking more countries with a population of 100 or 200 million.</p><p>  But you also run a risk because what if Turkey or Brazil has a coup.</p><p>SLOAN: That's one of the reasons Jeff and I aren't facing enormous competition from the major players. We feel more comfortable. I've done this for 15 years in one form of unstable environment after another. I was in Eastern Europe when the Berlin Wall first came down, with the first TV license in Hungary and Poland and a lot of places, and it all worked out well. It worked out better than in Western Europe, where you had completely stable politics.</p><p>  So where are you bidding now overseas?</p><p>SAGANSKY: We're not going to tell you exactly what countries we're looking at.</p><p>  But where's the likelihood to make your first acquisition?</p><p>SAGANSKY: I think that outside the U.S. has a slight edge over inside the U.S. We do see ourselves as internationalists. There's a certain amount of political and economical risks that we're prepared to take -- media companies haven't taken enough risks at all in the past 15 years, and they're paying the price for it today.</p><p>  I think that content producers, they're going to continue to do very well because they produce at a level of quality and quantity above anyone else in the world. And if anything, because of the digital technology, CGI, in the effects business, that gulf is growing. You can see it.</p><p>  On the other side, their ability to compete in distribution -- other than the physical distribution -- it's lagging. These aren't entrepreneurial cultures.</p><p>  So it sounds like you're pessimistic about --</p><p>SAGANSKY: Their ability to create value. When you look at the startups and really all over the world, these are low overhead operations. They have to shift their busienss strategies on a dime sometimes. You can't do that within the bureaucracy of these media companies.</p><p>  Which is to say that this makes you pessimistic about their ability --</p><p>SAGANSKY: -- to be growth engines. Their stocks are the same as they were 15 years ago.</p><p>  SLOAN: The major media companies are playing a defensive game, and I'm not sure I blame them. If you look at the digital revolution, you look at who the winners and the losers are, there are some very very big losers -- music, the newspaper industry. And there are some really big winners, social media, Facebook.</p><p>  The issue for the major companies is how, is how when and where to make their content online. And the major studios, like I said, are playing a very defensive game right now. They're putting a little bit of their current TV series on right now, some of their deep library through Netflix, but they're being very very careful about exposing the content that represents about 75 percent of their market value -- and that's their cable networks. So you look at these major cable companies, whether it's Disney or Time Warner, News Corp., ESPN, USA, they're being very very careful, about making their content available over the internet, and they're trying to figure it out.</p><p>  SLOAN: And that's why we don't want to invest in traditional media in the U.S.\u00a0 -- because they've got to a point where Jeff said some of these stocks they're trading the same stocks they were 15 years ago ... there's no growth.

Live from CNN London, I'm Hala Gorani. Tonight, cuffed and charged with rape, disgraced movie producer, Harvey Weinstein turns himself into police today accused of multiple sexual crimes against women. We are live in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, ahead, a day after canceling the North Korea summit, Donald Trump now says it could still happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, an investigation is underway at downing street after the U.K. foreign secretary spent almost 20 minutes on the phone with a prank caller. We have the reporting for you.</p><p>For decades, Harvey Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in the movie business capable of launching or destroying careers. Just a few hours ago, the now-disgraced movie producer appeared in a New York court, charged with rape and other sex crimes against two women.</p><p>These criminal charges are the first against him after allegations of sexual misconduct for more than 80 women last fall. Weinstein left the hearing, his bond set at $10 million. His bail at $1 million. He's required to wear a monitoring device and had to surrender his passport.</p><p>And more charges are expected, but just after the hearing, Weinstein's attorney claimed the state is going to have a hard time proving its case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S ATTORNEY: He has vehemently denied any of the allegations, which suggest that he engaged in non-consensual sexual activity. I anticipate that the women who have made these allegations, when subjected to cross-examination, in the event we even get that far, that the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair people, who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, this is the attorney for Harvey Weinstein. And when the widespread allegations against Weinstein became public last year, it sparked a global reckoning about sex abuse and harassment. The #metoomovement was born.</p><p>Correspondent, Brynn Gingras, joins me now from New York with more. So, where does this go from here? I mean, essentially Harvey Weinstein was freed on $1 million bail. He has to wear an ankle bracelet or a monitoring device. What happens now?</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Hala, really, this is only the beginning for Harvey Weinstein because investigations are still ongoing in London. We have one also in Los Angeles, and then we also know there's a federal probe happening here in New York and last week, we learned that there is a grand jury that's been convened.</p><p>And they've been hearing testimony from at least four women accusers, as well as evidence. And so, there are more charges that could be coming down the pipeline for Harvey Weinstein. So, this is really just the beginning of his legal battle.</p><p>But, yes, you outlined perfectly the conditions of his bail. He is out on bail. We do believe he did go to a home in Connecticut. But of course, with that ankle monitoring bracelets, authorities will have -- will able to keep track of him 24/7.</p><p>GORANI: And what -- specifically with this case, what are the next steps now for him?</p><p>GINGRAS: Well, for this case specifically, he has to appear in court next month. But we are going to learn next week from his attorney, who you already heard there, Ben Brafman, if he's going to testify to that grand jury. Again, those proceedings have been ongoing for weeks.</p><p>And it's very possible we'll get more charges. So, it will be interesting to see. Of course, those are closed -- those will be closed to the public. But it will be interesting to see if Weinstein goes forward to those jurors in those proceedings.</p><p>GORANI: And Brynn, stand by. Rose McGowan, who is, of course, one of the initial Weinstein accusers, who says she was one of his victims, had this to say in reaction to the developments today. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Do you think he thought this day would come?</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTRESS: No. No, he did not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Because the system was created to protect men like him?</p><p>MCGOWAN: The system was created by men like him and his accomplices to protect him. It's tragic that it takes over a hundred women, and that probably means like a thousand, let's be real. I mean, this man had hunting grounds all over the world and he had accomplices and a complicity machine. You know, he was the cult leader of Hollywood. There will always be sociopaths and predators like Harvey Weinstein, but I find his complicity machine a lot more guilty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:05:12] GORANI: That's Rose McGowan. Brynn, I was curious, because you did mention that there were other cases potentially brewing. Was there anyone in the courtroom today there to support Weinstein? Did he have any family members, any friends, anyone there with him or was he all alone facing these charges?</p><p>GINGRAS: No, he was pretty much all alone. It's also important to note that there are actually no victims in the courtroom that we know of either. But, yes, he was all alone. People described him inside the courtroom as being a little bit dazed, out of it, as he faced that judge.</p><p>I do want to point out, since you played that Rose McGowan (inaudible), Ben Brafman, his attorney, when he came out here and spoke to the media, he made a very striking comments about these accusations.</p><p>Basically, saying that he defends his clients on facts, on criminal charges, and not just accusations. That his client, Harvey Weinstein, didn't invent the casting couch in Hollywood, almost defending him, that he's not the only person who has done things like this, possibly even setting up a defense, which we might see if and when this goes to trial -- Hala.</p><p>GORANI: Brynn Gingras, thanks very much, outside the courtroom, the courthouse there in New York, where Harvey Weinstein faced a judge and posted $1 million bail there. He is free on bail for now.</p><p>So, what is next for Harvey Weinstein in dealing with sex misconduct charges that can be very difficult to prove in court?</p><p>Joining me now, also from New York, is our legal analyst, Joey Jackson. He's a criminal defense attorney. What did you make of what the lawyer said? He basically said, you know, we're going to have to prove this. We're going to have to convince the prosecution.</p><p>We'll have to convince 12 jurors if they are fair jurors, essentially blaming, it sounded like, the \"Me Too Movement\" for, you know, maybe brainwashing people into thinking some men did bad things when in fact they didn't. What did you make of that?</p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Well, you know, Hala, a couple of things. First of all, I should say, that I'm a product of that Manhattan District Attorney's Office, the one that's prosecuting him now, Sy Vans is in charge. Morgan (inaudible) was in charge when I was there although Ben Brafman was a significant presence.</p><p>He was part of our training when I was an assistant district attorney when he was a defense attorney. So very well respected, very highly regarded and come out swinging, right? That's what he did. That's what he taught everyone else to do.</p><p>And here's the reality. You have a distinction that he's trying to make between bad behavior on the one hand, which apparently is rampant in Hollywood, and what he is suggesting that as the attorney, as criminal behavior on the other.</p><p>Remember that he said that it was no time that his client engaged in conduct that was not otherwise consensual. And so, I think that will be the refrain here. In addition to that, he also, Ben Brafman, his defense attorney, is saying that I'm challenging the sufficiency of any evidence he has as it relates to the complaint.</p><p>I'm making a motion to dismiss. And I think he's going to predicate that motion upon factual allegations that can't be substantiated to this point, as well as perhaps, Hala, some statute of limitations issues.</p><p>Remember that one allegation goes back to 2004, so there's a question as to whether that's viable now. So, the attorney is in full swing mode, full defense mode, and I think we'll see a lot of that in the days, weeks, and months to come.</p><p>GORANI: Because in court, and this is always something that people who say there are victims of rape and sex abuse in court, it is -- I mean, it is difficult to prove rape, right, in a courtroom, in a court of law?</p><p>JACKSON: You know what, Hala, it could be, and it also depends upon when the rape happened in conjunction with when the crime was actually leveled against you. Often times, if it's more recent, they do rape kits, there's analysis, there's DNA, there's some type of connection to connect the person accused to the actual accuser.</p><p>In this case, because of one happening in 2013, I doubt that will be the case. Another one in 2004, I doubt that will be the case. And you heard Ben Brafman say, he will cross-examine them.</p><p>In our system that means you challenge the sufficiency of the witness's recollection, you challenge what their course of events they suggest are. And I think he'll go after them, you know, pretty aggressively.</p><p>But there are expert witnesses, who will testify in these cases, which are hard to prove, that there are reasons why women don't come forward right away. There are reasons of humiliation, reasons of shame, there are reasons of embarrassment, there's reasons they blame themselves.</p><p>And I have tried sex cases where, in fact, those experts come and they're very persuasive and explain to the jury what women feel when they are violated.</p><p>GORANI: And it just feels like now with the \"Me Too Movement\" perhaps some of these concepts are better understood by the wider public as to why people don't necessarily come forward right away.</p><p>I want to show our viewers the charges that Harvey Weinstein is facing. We have some graphics made up here, detailing those for our viewers. The charges explained rape in the first degree.</p><p>[15:10:05] There are also a couple of other charges that we can put up there related to alleged sexual abuse, criminal sexual act in the first degree as well as a third charge, which we're going to put up there as well for our viewers.</p><p>And then rape in the third-degree. So, what do you make of these charges? What -- how differently would a defense attorney or a prosecutor, in fact, tackle this case, based on these charges that we've told our viewers about?</p><p>JACKSON: Well, you know what, Hala? The first thing to make mention of is that those are very significant charges. They are \"B\" felonies. In English, what that means is a person convicted can face 25 years in jail, at least as to the first-degree accounts, Rape in the first degree, forcible compulsion in the first-degree.</p><p>The other one, there's no mandatory jail time, but you know, you're not worried about that when you're worried about the others. So, obviously, with Ben Brafman setting up, the defense attorney, the defense of, if things did occur and you credit any victims' claims that it was consensual, that he didn't take advantage of them.</p><p>That's lot to overcome, though, because we're in a different cliate. And I'm going to be looking for as matters move forward, we are not there yet, we are not at trial. We haven't even had a grand jury indictment, but I'm interested in knowing how many other accusers if any the judge will allow to testify.</p><p>That can be compelling evidence. We've had occasion to speak about Bill Cosby in the past. And remember in his trial, five prior accusers testified. That weighs heavily on a jury because they're looking and they're saying, hey, this maybe your M.O. so I'm going to be looking for in the event the case moves forward, Hala, how many other victims the judge will permit to testify.</p><p>GORANI: That's going to be very interesting. Joey Jackson, thanks, as always, for your analysis on this.</p><p>JACKSON: Of course.</p><p>GORANI: Now to international diplomacy and the North Korean situation. A day ago, he gave North Korea the cold shoulder, but today Donald Trump is warming up once again to the idea of a historic summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p>The American president is now leaving the possibility open after he abruptly canceled talks scheduled for June 12th, accusing Pyongyang, of quote, \"open hostility.\" North Korea responded with a perhaps surprising conciliatory statement, saying it is ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time.</p><p>He welcomed that gesture as warm and productive and acknowledged to reporters that, quote, \"Everybody plays games.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We're going to see what happens. We're talking to them now. It was a very nice statement that they put out. We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens. It could even be the 12th. We are talking to them now. They very much want to do it. We'd like to do it. We're going to see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Mr. Trump has made it a top foreign policy priority to convince North Korea to fully denuclearize. Unclear if North Korea would be up for that. It doesn't sound like it from their statements in the past.</p><p>The entire region, of course, is concerned. In fact, Japan's ambassador to the U.K. says the summit itself is not that important as long as the goal of denuclearization is achieved.</p><p>Koji Tsurouka joins me now in the studio. Thank you, Ambassador, for being with us. Do you think the summit is going to happen in the end on June 12th? We are getting whiplash everyday --</p><p>KOJI TSUROUKA, JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.: I couldn't say, you know, it was just, we just heard the president saying, well, we'll just have to see what happens.</p><p>GORANI: Because every day it seems like we are getting a different message and a development that contradicts the one from the day before. So, it's hard to keep up. When you are Japan and you are so directly concerned with what's going on and you look to the messages from America, do you find it confusing sometimes?</p><p>TSUROUKA: Not necessarily. The summit itself, we were hoping, and we still have hope that if it indeed it happens, it will -- it should be able to deliver what the world has been seeking all this time and there's been a series of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted and they are all aiming at having a complete verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea.</p><p>So, if this target and goal can be brought close by having a meeting, of course, I am sure that the meeting will be very productive.</p><p>GORANI: Japan wants to continue pressure on North Korea to change its policies, to ultimately denuclearize. What does that exactly mean? What is Japan's role here in this process?</p><p>TSUROUKA: We are, of course, neighbors to both North and South Korea, but we have had many contacts in the past, bilaterally with the North Koreans, which include the issue of abduction of the Japanese nationals.</p><p>Five have returned with Prime Minister Kouzumi (ph) visited Pyongyang, but we still have many more remaining unaccounted. And this is another issue that we are continuing to try to resolve.</p><p>[15:15:05] And we have said that we will be happy to engage with the North Koreans provided that there will be complete denuclearization of North Korea, as well as all of the abolishing ballistic missiles of all range.</p><p>GORANI: But it doesn't sound like Kim Jong-un is up for that. I mean, when the idea was floated of the Libya model by John Bolton, the national security adviser, which, of course, in 2003-2004 was a model that led to Libya surrendering basically all of its nuclear capability.</p><p>That clearly angered North Korea. They don't see denuclearization in the same light as America does or as you are describing. It doesn't sound like everyone is on the same page.</p><p>TSUROUKA: That is not necessarily very surprising. For example, you're not interviewing a North Korean.</p><p>GORANI: I know but what you're saying is your end goal is not the end goal of the North Koreans. So where do you -- at some point a compromise needs to be made or there is no deal.</p><p>TSUROUKA: Well, you have to ask the North Koreans what their end goal is. Yes, I think you're quite right, Hala, they do not say in public that they are ready to accept the terms that the U.N. Security Council has adopted unanimously.</p><p>And the same time, they said they are willing to meet with President Trump and President Trump responded positively. And this is the start of this talk about summit and then there have been two visits by the secretary of state, first as the director of CIA, then after being confirmed as the secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo has been to Pyongyang twice. And this is no light matter.</p><p>GORANI: Yes. Are you -- of course, some of these missiles tests -- some of these missiles actually landed very close to Japan, just a few dozen miles off your coast. I mean, do you feel like there is an existential threat against your country by North Korea?</p><p>TSUROUKA: We absolutely believe that this is a real threat to our security, and not just for Japan, but for the region and for the whole world at last, and this is why the U.N. is taking these very strong sanctions until such time as they will be totally denuclearized and then able to cooperate in peace.</p><p>GORANI: Would anything less than total denuclearization satisfy you?</p><p>TSUROUKA: We are not prepared to accept North Korean being recognized as a nuclear weapons state.</p><p>GORANI: But a nuclear program that is not weaponized? I mean, things like that or is it total denuclearization? In which case, the reason I ask is if that's the end goal, it seems like it would be a very long and potentially fruitless process as the North Koreans don't seem to be willing to go that far.</p><p>TSUROUKA: Which we have been engaged for the last 20 years and we've been trying to help them reach that goal, but so far, we haven't been successful. But that doesn't mean we have no goal at all. And that's why this summit may, if happens, be a productive summit.</p><p>GORANI: And lastly, do you think -- because we're talking about 20 years, and we've been covering it for 20 years, these talks and this process. There were the six-party talks that didn't really achieve the desired result. Do you think that the U.S. -- the current U.S. President Donald Trump is effective in his strategy with North Korea?</p><p>TSUROUKA: I'm sure that Mr. Trump, the president, has made his views very clear. There's been numerous meetings with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, bilaterally, and they've discussed these issue in great depths. So, I think Mr. Trump is more aware of the North Korean issue than any other president that preceded him.</p><p>GORANI: That's interesting. So, you think more so than Barack Obama? That he's more are, more on top of what needs to be done?</p><p>TSUROUKA: I think (inaudible) wouldn't have missed any point in many of the meetings that they had bilaterally among the two of them. And there's been a number of them starting with his visit to the Trump Tower in New York. This is the issue that my prime minister and my people are very concerned about.</p><p>GORANI: Ambassador Koji Tsurouka, thank you very much for joining us in this studio. We appreciate it.</p><p>Mr. Trump called off the summit just as North Korea was making a dramatic goodwill gesture and invited journalists, including CNN's Will Ripley to watch what it calls the destruction of a nuclear test site. Will filed this report on his extraordinary journey inside North Korea, a trip, as always, that was tightly controlled. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: I'm here at North Korea's nuclear test site at Pyunggeri, a place foreign journalists have never been allowed before. We are here, the North Korean government says to witness the destruction of the site. They say it will never be able to be used again.</p><p>(voice-over): With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes. We travel around 15 hours to get here. First, by bus, through the coastal city of Wonsan. Compartment seven here we are. Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>(on camera): It is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm having dinner on a train going through North Korea.</p><p>(voice-over): A luxury ride, by North Korean standards.</p><p>(on camera): They just came through and they closed all of the blinds and told us that for the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the windows.</p><p>(voice-over): We pulled into Pyunggeri Station. Then begin the nearly two-hour drive to the test site. Once again, no filming along the way.</p><p>(on camera): We passed through a number of what look like small farming villages. There was no sign of life. Completely empty except for the handful of soldiers at the guard posts along the way.</p><p>(voice-over): We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's Nuclear Weapons Institute. He won't tell us his name. Then we are allowed to inspect the tunnels. North Korea says they could have easily conducted more nuclear tests here. They say two tunnels have never been used.</p><p>(on camera): So, they say by rigging with explosives and blowing it up, that is a meaningful step towards denuclearization.</p><p>(voice-over): No nuclear weapons experts in our small group, only journalists.</p><p>(on camera): It's actually quite beautiful here. The North Koreans say that the eco system hasn't been damaged by all these nuclear tests for more than decade. They say no radiation has seeped out. Journalists aren't allowed to carry radiation detectors ourselves. They were taken away at the airport, so we have to take their word for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The dismantling of the nuclear test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of the DPRK.</p><p>RIPLEY: You really do get the sense that you are witnessing history here, which is why we are documenting every single building on this site because by the end of the day, it will all be gone.</p><p>(voice-over): We hiked to an observation post, built just for us and watch Pyunggeri go up in smoke.

Samuel Burke has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT: Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade. And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER: They were looking for big companies that really willfully violate the law that kind of try to ignore it and get away with it.</p><p>BURKE: Schrem's who helped write the regulation says he is taking legal action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS: This idea, if we don't want this, we think it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it and there's obvious business interests. There are certain things you simply can do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE: The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity, and sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent. According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL VOOLE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UCL: On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion, or political beliefs. And if you put that on you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents, (inaudible) advertising and so on. There is an accept button. There's not an \"I don't accept\" button. Exactly, you got it.</p><p>BURKE: The deal says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also sent over to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE: Failure to comply could be costly. For a big company like Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>(voice-over): In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer says the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access, download, and delete their information.</p><p>The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We do expect to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE: Lawyer, Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS: If we enforce it properly, we can get a balance in this in the end, you as a customer have the possibility of using Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE: However, the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.

Some media sites, for instance, and some publishing groups are blocking EU access, meaning that the continent no longer has access to news pages like the LA Times. That's what you get when you're in the EU and you try to access the Los Angeles Times. The Chicago Tribune or the New York Daily News. The publishers say they're looking for a way to open up once again to Europeans, basically complying to European requirements under GDPR.</p><p>Still to come tonight, it was on, now it was off, now it's up in the air. We'll look at the efforts to get the U.S./North Korea summit back on track.</p><p>And then, not exactly what North Korea wants to see. The U.S. and South Korea are flexing their military might, conducting drills right in Pyongyang's backyard. We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: One thing we know for certain today about the U.S.-North Korean summit is a definite maybe. Both Washington and Pyongyang are keeping hopes alive that the historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un may happen after all. Yesterday, the U.S. president abruptly called of the talks scheduled for June 12th in Singapore, accusing North Korea of open hostility. The U.S. and South Korea just conducted annual military drills that never failed to anger the North. CNN's Paula Hancocks got exclusive access to film the exercises and filed this report from an airbase in South Korea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Loading missiles onto an F-16 fighter jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat and imaginary enemy.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Yes, this is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drill that North Korea slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations the South and the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>COL. DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING: While the situation in the background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder. The exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is what tactical level and operability learning to fight together as alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS: Pyongyang cancel high level talks with South Korea because of this drill, calling it, quote, \"An intentional military provocation.\" The first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just canceled. But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>[15:35:14] The situation on the Korean peninsula right now really could not be more different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were last held.</p><p>But for those involve in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S. Air Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant. The most important thing despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise. A South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over according to aides. But a lot has changed since then. It's unclear if this drill was really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump or a convenient excuse.</p><p>But what is clear is that these types of drills infuriate Pyongyang, year- in, year-out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, the Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: Donald Trump has built an entire reputation on deal-making. He calls himself the ultimate negotiator, who can get things done when no one else can. Could his unorthodox style actually pay off in the diplomatic effort with North Korea? Let's bring in CNN's global affairs correspondent, Elise Labott, and CNN global affairs analyst, Joseph Yun.</p><p>Joseph Yun, let me start with you. I mean, this is whiplash diplomacy. One day it's on, the next day is off, the third day it's maybe. Is this a strategy or is this a lack of strategy? How do you read this kind of up and down trajectory?</p><p>JOSEPH YUN, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: Well, I would lean towards the latter, myself. I think it's been clear from the beginning that really there wasn't enough contact. What we are seeing is two narratives colliding. On the one hand, there is really the personal investment of President Trump, as well as, I would say Kim Jong-un to make history. On the other hand, you know, it is very clear that the positions of Washington and Pyongyang are so far apart that those under them, those working for them are having a hard time seeing whether this summit could succeed so they are concluding that no summit is better than bad summit, but there are -- there is the personal ambition of President Trump to make history, to make something in a major league foreign policy area. So that's why we're seeing the rollercoaster ride.</p><p>GORANI: And, Elise, is it revivable, the summit, for June 12th in Singapore?</p><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: I mean, look, I don't think any U.S. officials that we've spoken to, myself or my colleagues at CNN, the only person that thinks that having it on June 12th, which is just weeks away, is a good idea, except President Trump.</p><p>I mean, there are some officials that think that it was a good idea for President Trump to delay it because either, a, he wasn't going to get much out of this summit or, b, he has a little bit more of kind of an upper hand now. But if the reasons for him pulling out where the fact that he doesn't have much clarity on what Kim Jong-un is willing to put on the table, I think he still doesn't have that kind of clarity.</p><p>There haven't been -- we tend to forget, Hala, that these usually negotiators kind of do this from the bottom up and negotiate or communicate. There's been no draft floating around. I still think they're kind of both flying blind as to what the other is really -- what the bottom line is. So I think there is a desire to have a summit at some point. You know, President Trump certainly wants to keep hope alive that it'll be June 12th. But I think by anyone's standards, having it on June 12th doesn't set the president up for the kind of success that he says he wants.</p><p>GORANI: Joseph Yun, you've worked on the North Korea question in government, and Elise is describing usually the diplomatic initiatives, which you're so familiar with and for those of us who have covered these stories as well. You'll usually have advanced teams, you'll have mid-level talks, they'll try to iron out some sort of announcement before the summit even takes place, and then work toward that. It appears there's been none of that in this particular case. How do you think that impacts things going forward?</p><p>YUN: I think that's a really big negative. That there has been no prep work done for this summit, at least prep work on substantive level. We've seen two trips by Secretary Pompeo, one when he was director of CIA, and then one later. And those, I think allowed for some exchange, but really, no clarity on really serious issues like how long should denuclearization take? What is the definition of denuclearization?</p><p>[15:40:09] GORANI: And that's important. That's the most important thing. I just spoke to the Japanese ambassador to the U.K., and I asked him that very question, Elise and Joseph. When you ask for total denuclearization of North Korea and it really, we know from what the North Koreans have said that this not something that they would consider, going as far as total denuclearization -- having define the end goal yet, we -- get there, Elise.</p><p>LABOTT: And also, you know, what would - how long - As Joe said, how long would it take, do the North Koreans have to do it all in -- over a period of time before they get any kind of benefits to the so-called agreement? Or is it going to be an action for action as the North Koreans have wanted some for so many years, they want to take like little small steps like the lowest common denominator and then get all these frontloading, all of these economic and security benefits and what U.S. officials say is -- and you heard Secretary Pompeo said the other day, no. It's not going to be over an extended period of time where North Korea can get the benefits without having to do kind of like Iran did and the deal that President Trump said was a bad deal and that he pulled out.</p><p>Unfortunately, President Trump seems to be setting him up, at least in word himself up, at least by what he says for the same kind of deal then he pulled out with Iran by saying, oh, you know, I'd like them in one -- at one go, but maybe it'll have to be overtime. So I don't even think the U.S. is really clear about what kind of agreement they want to have with the North Koreans and what that kind of denuclearization looks like - like looks like for them. We all kind of float the word around denuclearization but it's kind of one of those buzzwords that could mean so many things to so many different countries.</p><p>GORANI: And Donald Trump had this to say, by the way, about America's standing in the world with regards to its foreign policy. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You are now leaders in the most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet, the United States military. And we are respected again, I can tell you. We are respected again.</p><p>And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago, abroad, America is back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Joseph Yun, this is a light motif of his. I wonder abroad and internationally, what Donald Trump is saying, how has received outside of the United States?</p><p>YUN: Well, there is some element of threat, you know. And I think we cannot take that lightly. I mean, you know, President Trump is absolutely right. The arsenal, the military projection that we have in the United States is far greater than anyone else. So there is no doubt when North Koreans hear it or the Chinese hear it, there is an edge to it that, you know, that we cannot dismiss so easily.</p><p>LABOTT: But if I could, Hala, I think that's true. But at the same time, I think the U.S. military has always been respected. The United States has always been respected as the greatest force in the world. I think the new dynamic is the unpredictability of President Trump. And while, you know, maybe there was a loss of respect for some of the kind of inaction or dithering that one might say was under President Obama. Now, this is kind of unpredictability that maybe countries aren't respecting but they're certainly taking a lot more notice and having to pay a lot closer attention because otherwise, as you said it'll be whiplash for them.</p><p>GORANI: Thanks, Elise Labott and Joseph Yun and thanks so much to both of you for joining us this evening.</p><p>Still to come tonight, Amazon's Alexa is listening in. It's recording what you're saying and then it sends the recording to a co-worker. This is not a bad dream. It happens. And Amazon is feeling the heat for it.</p><p>And who calls? Not a prime minister. The prank call that fooled this man, the U.K. foreign secretary. We'll play some of it for you, next.</p><p>[15:45:33] GORANI: In London, the U.K. foreign office is not amused after two Russian pranksters duped the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. And then was pretending to be the new Armenian prime minister. And he managed to have an 18-minute conversation with Johnson. The call covered relations with Russia, the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the U.K. and how to deal with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. The chat ended when one of the pranksters advised Johnson to try a new kind of poison. They've since released the recording. Listen to some of it.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY (via telephone): It would be great to welcome you to the U.K. Whatever that would be convenient for you though. I imagine you have a lot on your plate at the moment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes. Thank you for your invitation and in one month I will shape new government. As you know, I have a meeting with President Putin in Sochi next week.</p><p>JOHNSON: Next week, I know it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I need to be prepared. I hope he will not poison me with Novichok.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well it's very important, I think, prime minister, that we don't have a new Cold War.</p><p>GORANI: It was -- I hope it will not poison me with Novichok is what the prankster was saying and you could feel that was already awkward tension there from the -- from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, not necessarily knowing how to respond there to that. It was a prankster. And the foreign secretary and the foreign office is not happy about that prank call. It lasted 18 minutes. Imagine that.</p><p>Amazon is facing questions over its voice-assisted Alexa which powers its Echo speakers after a woman in Portland says that her speaker recorded a conversation with her husband, then sent to the audio file to a contact. And I don't know how dangerous that is. Anna Stewart has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a cautionary tale of technology telling too much. A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then e-mails a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>Danielle, Amazon Alexa User: I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion, like immediately I'm like, I'll never plug in that device again. I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works for her husband. She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>DANIELLE: The person on the other line said, unplug your Alexa devices right now. We go run and unplugged them all and he proceeded to tell us that he had audio files recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon told CNN affiliate Kiro 7, the device misinterpreted commands like send message and the contacts name as part of the background conversation, and caught it in extremely rare occurrence. It's unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light out when it was activated or if the device response at all. Either way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:50:57] GORANI: So Seth Fiegerman has been following this from New York. So I don't have an Alexa. Exactly, how did this happen? The machine, the speaker misunderstood from the couple who command to sell this -- sorry. Send this audio file?</p><p>SETH FIEGERMAN, CNN SENIOR TECH REPORTER: Well, the way Alexa works generally is it picks up voice cues in order to provide you with the information that you want. In this case, Amazon is saying that it overheard parts of a conversation and mishear words like Alexa to turn it on, send a message to start cueing up a message. And even the name of a contact to send that message to. It's a reminder that these products are always listening to you. But the intention after providing you a certain convenience and yet, they're not perfect and might mishear things and ultimately cause you a great inconvenience.</p><p>GORANI: But it seems like telling Alexa to turn itself on to then, you know, produce a clip of a conversation and send it to a contacts, so that should be a very complex set of command. The fact that all of these commands were misunderstood in a single operation by the speaker, I don't understand how that can happen.</p><p>FIEGERMAN: I think a lot of people are puzzling over themselves right now. I do think it's fair to say it's a fluke. We've got to hear of another example of that in the years since this product has been introduced. Amazon calls is an extremely unlikely occurrence. But it does raise concerns that these things can't perfectly hear what you're saying. You forget that they're there. They blend into the background and ultimately you might accidentally trigger and inconvenient and scary occurrence.</p><p>GORANI: Well, they're lucky that it was only a conversation about hardwood floors right?</p><p>FIEGERMAN: Agreed.</p><p>GORANI: Not something else. Seth, thanks very much for joining us. Seth Fiegerman.</p><p>More to come including rivers of fire beneath the ocean in Hawaii as the eruptions continue. We are live in Hawaii, next.</p><p>GORANI: Well, the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has continued to spew lava. You can see here the active fissures bubbling up at the surface of the big island. Now, streams of lava are entering the Pacific Ocean near a power plant. So it could be an issue. But so far though thankfully that plant is not endangered. Scott McLean who is right next to some of that lava flow joins me now live.</p><p>What's going on where you are, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Hala. So people on this section of the big island, they seemed to be playing this volcanic game of Whac-A- Mole, just when you think that things are dying down in one area, they suddenly spring up. And another case and point this giant fissure that you see behind me, it's the one that we've been watching for a couple of days now and it has shrunk substantially. That said, there is another one that sprung to seemingly take its place and it is pumping lava into a place that really does not needed. A neighborhood called Leilani Estates, a subdivision not far from here that has been terrorized by lava since Kilauea first woke up. And there are also fears that we are just getting actually in the last couple of hours, an official warnings from authorities that another lava flow could cross a major highway in this area which would cut off our routes, the place where I'm standing right now. We'd have to find an alternate route. It also means that people in that area, on the North side of that highway are starting to pack up and it is proving just how unpredictable Kilauea can be.</p><p>[15:55:01] GORANI: And so, what is -- I mean, it appears as though this volcano is not lighting up that this is going to be a reality for that part of Hawaii for the foreseeable future.</p><p>MCLEAN: It seems that way. The experts will tell you that they don't know or at least they don't seem to know exactly at this point how long this will last. They can use sort of other eruptions in the past as a historical, you know, marker. But at the end of the day, this volcano is going to erupt for as long as it does and they can't exactly pin down when this will be over, when people will be able to go home.</p><p>GORANI: And what about residents? I can only imagine that at this point, they must be quite fed up.</p><p>MCLEAN: Yes. I think -- you talked to a lot of people who may be thought that they were OK a couple of weeks ago, thought that things were going to be just fine and now all of a sudden, they are sort of packing up as a precaution, especially now with this word that things have crossed -- or maybe crossing the highway.</p><p>Quickly, Hala, I also spoke to a gentleman who had two homes, that he has fully expected would get swallowed up by the lava, but a man Darryl Clinton actually protected them. He is the guy who got hit by a lava bomb. I caught up with the homeowner of those homes that he was protecting yesterday. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT: We approached this, I think the way you're supposed to. We spoke to out Hawaiian friends in Kalapana. And, you know, you clean house for them. You prepare and then you -- you're not in charge. And I think that Darryl and Lisa, Mark no doubt about us and we left with a humble hope that we would be able to be back and I think nature's wanted to help, wanted to facilitate in any way that they could, you know. It's hard when your friend gets hurt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLEAN: So, Hala, just to hammer home how extraordinary this is, the man you heard there, he fully expected that when he left, he took all of his furniture with them. He thought that his two homes on that property would be gone. The only reason that they are there today is because of that man named Darryl Clinton, the only person, so far, to have been injured by Kilauea.</p><p>GORANI: incredible.

Live from CNN London, I'm Hala  Gorani.  Tonight, cuffed and charged with rape, disgraced movie producer,  Harvey Weinstein turns himself into police today accused of multiple sexual  crimes against women.  We are live in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Also, ahead, a day after canceling the North Korea summit, Donald Trump now  says it could still happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Plus, an investigation is underway at downing street after the U.K. foreign  secretary spent almost 20 minutes on the phone with a prank caller.  We  have the reporting for you.</p><p> For decades, Harvey Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in the movie  business capable of launching or destroying careers.  Just a few hours ago,  the now-disgraced movie producer appeared in a New York court, charged with  rape and other sex crimes against two women.</p><p> These criminal charges are the first against him after allegations of  sexual misconduct for more than 80 women last fall.  Weinstein left the  hearing, his bond set at $10 million.  His bail at $1 million.  He's  required to wear a monitoring device and had to surrender his passport.</p><p> And more charges are expected, but just after the hearing, Weinstein's  attorney claimed the state is going to have a hard time proving its case.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S ATTORNEY:  He has vehemently denied  any of the allegations, which suggest that he engaged in non-consensual  sexual activity.  I anticipate that the women who have made these  allegations, when subjected to cross-examination, in the event we even get  that far, that the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we  get 12 fair people, who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have  overtaken this case.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Well, this is the attorney for Harvey Weinstein.  And when the  widespread allegations against Weinstein became public last year, it  sparked a global reckoning about sex abuse and harassment.  The  #metoomovement was born.</p><p> Correspondent, Brynn Gingras, joins me now from New York with more.  So,  where does this go from here?  I mean, essentially Harvey Weinstein was  freed on $1 million bail.  He has to wear an ankle bracelet or a monitoring  device.  What happens now?</p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Hala, really, this is  only the beginning for Harvey Weinstein because investigations are still  ongoing in London.  We have one also in Los Angeles, and then we also know  there's a federal probe happening here in New York and last week, we  learned that there is a grand jury that's been convened.</p><p> And they've been hearing testimony from at least four women accusers, as  well as evidence.  And so, there are more charges that could be coming down  the pipeline for Harvey Weinstein.  So, this is really just the beginning  of his legal battle.</p><p> But, yes, you outlined perfectly the conditions of his bail.  He is out on  bail.  We do believe he did go to a home in Connecticut.  But of course,  with that ankle monitoring bracelets, authorities will have -- will able to  keep track of him 24/7.</p><p> GORANI:  And what -- specifically with this case, what are the next steps  now for him?</p><p> GINGRAS:  Well, for this case specifically, he has to appear in court next  month.  But we are going to learn next week from his attorney, who you  already heard there, Ben Brafman, if he's going to testify to that grand  jury.  Again, those proceedings have been ongoing for weeks.</p><p> And it's very possible we'll get more charges.  So, it will be interesting  to see.  Of course, those are closed -- those will be closed to the public.   But it will be interesting to see if Weinstein goes forward to those jurors  in those proceedings.</p><p> GORANI:  And Brynn, stand by.  Rose McGowan, who is, of course, one of the  initial Weinstein accusers, who says she was one of his victims, had this  to say in reaction to the developments today.  Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think he thought this day would come?</p><p> ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTRESS:  No.  No, he did not.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because the system was created to protect men like  him?</p><p> MCGOWAN:  The system was created by men like him and his accomplices to  protect him.  It's tragic that it takes over a hundred women, and that  probably means like a thousand, let's be real.  I mean, this man had  hunting grounds all over the world and he had accomplices and a complicity  machine.  You know, he was the cult leader of Hollywood.  There will always  be sociopaths and predators like Harvey Weinstein, but I find his  complicity machine a lot more guilty.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> [15:05:12] GORANI:  That's Rose McGowan.  Brynn, I was curious, because you  did mention that there were other cases potentially brewing.  Was there  anyone in the courtroom today there to support Weinstein?  Did he have any  family members, any friends, anyone there with him or was he all alone  facing these charges?</p><p> GINGRAS:  No, he was pretty much all alone.  It's also important to note  that there are actually no victims in the courtroom that we know of either.   But, yes, he was all alone.  People described him inside the courtroom as  being a little bit dazed, out of it, as he faced that judge.</p><p> I do want to point out, since you played that Rose McGowan (inaudible), Ben  Brafman, his attorney, when he came out here and spoke to the media, he  made a very striking comments about these accusations.</p><p> Basically, saying that he defends his clients on facts, on criminal  charges, and not just accusations.  That his client, Harvey Weinstein,  didn't invent the casting couch in Hollywood, almost defending him, that  he's not the only person who has done things like this, possibly even  setting up a defense, which we might see if and when this goes to trial --  Hala.</p><p> GORANI:  Brynn Gingras, thanks very much, outside the courtroom, the  courthouse there in New York, where Harvey Weinstein faced a judge and  posted $1 million bail there.  He is free on bail for now.</p><p> So, what is next for Harvey Weinstein in dealing with sex misconduct  charges that can be very difficult to prove in court?</p><p> Joining me now, also from New York, is our legal analyst, Joey Jackson.   He's a criminal defense attorney.  What did you make of what the lawyer  said?  He basically said, you know, we're going to have to prove this.   We're going to have to convince the prosecution.</p><p> We'll have to convince 12 jurors if they are fair jurors, essentially  blaming, it sounded like, the \"Me Too Movement\" for, you know, maybe  brainwashing people into thinking some men did bad things when in fact they  didn't.  What did you make of that?</p><p> JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, you know, Hala, a couple of things.   First of all, I should say, that I'm a product of that Manhattan District  Attorney's Office, the one that's prosecuting him now, Sy Vans is in  charge.  Morgan (inaudible) was in charge when I was there although Ben  Brafman was a significant presence.</p><p> He was part of our training when I was an assistant district attorney when  he was a defense attorney.  So very well respected, very highly regarded  and come out swinging, right?  That's what he did.  That's what he taught  everyone else to do.</p><p> And here's the reality.  You have a distinction that he's trying to make  between bad behavior on the one hand, which apparently is rampant in  Hollywood, and what he is suggesting that as the attorney, as criminal  behavior on the other.</p><p> Remember that he said that it was no time that his client engaged in  conduct that was not otherwise consensual.  And so, I think that will be  the refrain here.  In addition to that, he also, Ben Brafman, his defense  attorney, is saying that I'm challenging the sufficiency of any evidence he  has as it relates to the complaint.</p><p> I'm making a motion to dismiss.  And I think he's going to predicate that  motion upon factual allegations that can't be substantiated to this point,  as well as perhaps, Hala, some statute of limitations issues.</p><p> Remember that one allegation goes back to 2004, so there's a question as to  whether that's viable now.  So, the attorney is in full swing mode, full  defense mode, and I think we'll see a lot of that in the days, weeks, and  months to come.</p><p> GORANI:  Because in court, and this is always something that people who say  there are victims of rape and sex abuse in court, it is -- I mean, it is  difficult to prove rape, right, in a courtroom, in a court of law?</p><p> JACKSON:  You know what, Hala, it could be, and it also depends upon when  the rape happened in conjunction with when the crime was actually leveled  against you.  Often times, if it's more recent, they do rape kits, there's  analysis, there's DNA, there's some type of connection to connect the  person accused to the actual accuser.</p><p> In this case, because of one happening in 2013, I doubt that will be the  case.  Another one in 2004, I doubt that will be the case.  And you heard  Ben Brafman say, he will cross-examine them.</p><p> In our system that means you challenge the sufficiency of the witness's  recollection, you challenge what their course of events they suggest are.   And I think he'll go after them, you know, pretty aggressively.</p><p> But there are expert witnesses, who will testify in these cases, which are  hard to prove, that there are reasons why women don't come forward right  away.  There are reasons of humiliation, reasons of shame, there are  reasons of embarrassment, there's reasons they blame themselves.</p><p> And I have tried sex cases where, in fact, those experts come and they're  very persuasive and explain to the jury what women feel when they are  violated.</p><p> GORANI:  And it just feels like now with the \"Me Too Movement\" perhaps some  of these concepts are better understood by the wider public as to why  people don't necessarily come forward right away.</p><p> I want to show our viewers the charges that Harvey Weinstein is facing.  We  have some graphics made up here, detailing those for our viewers.  The  charges explained rape in the first degree.</p><p> [15:10:05] There are also a couple of other charges that we can put up  there related to alleged sexual abuse, criminal sexual act in the first  degree as well as a third charge, which we're going to put up there as well  for our viewers.</p><p> And then rape in the third-degree.  So, what do you make of these charges?   What -- how differently would a defense attorney or a prosecutor, in fact,  tackle this case, based on these charges that we've told our viewers about?</p><p> JACKSON:  Well, you know what, Hala?  The first thing to make mention of is  that those are very significant charges.  They are \"B\" felonies.  In  English, what that means is a person convicted can face 25 years in jail,  at least as to the first-degree accounts, Rape in the first degree,  forcible compulsion in the first-degree.</p><p> The other one, there's no mandatory jail time, but you know, you're not  worried about that when you're worried about the others.  So, obviously,  with Ben Brafman setting up, the defense attorney, the defense of, if  things did occur and you credit any victims' claims that it was consensual,  that he didn't take advantage of them.</p><p> That's lot to overcome, though, because we're in a different cliate.  And  I'm going to be looking for as matters move forward, we are not there yet,  we are not at trial.  We haven't even had a grand jury indictment, but I'm  interested in knowing how many other accusers if any the judge will allow  to testify.</p><p> That can be compelling evidence.  We've had occasion to speak about Bill  Cosby in the past.  And remember in his trial, five prior accusers  testified.  That weighs heavily on a jury because they're looking and  they're saying, hey, this maybe your M.O. so I'm going to be looking for in  the event the case moves forward, Hala, how many other victims the judge  will permit to testify.</p><p> GORANI:  That's going to be very interesting.  Joey Jackson, thanks, as  always, for your analysis on this.</p><p> JACKSON:  Of course.</p><p> GORANI:  Now to international diplomacy and the North Korean situation.  A  day ago, he gave North Korea the cold shoulder, but today Donald Trump is  warming up once again to the idea of a historic summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p> The American president is now leaving the possibility open after he  abruptly canceled talks scheduled for June 12th, accusing Pyongyang, of  quote, \"open hostility.\"  North Korea responded with a perhaps surprising  conciliatory statement, saying it is ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time.</p><p> He welcomed that gesture as warm and productive and acknowledged to  reporters that, quote, \"Everybody plays games.\"</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  We're going to  see what happens.  We're talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement  that they put out.  We'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  It  could even be the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want  to do it.  We'd like to do it.  We're going to see what happens.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Mr. Trump has made it a top foreign policy priority to convince  North Korea to fully denuclearize.  Unclear if North Korea would be up for  that.  It doesn't sound like it from their statements in the past.</p><p> The entire region, of course, is concerned.  In fact, Japan's ambassador to  the U.K. says the summit itself is not that important as long as the goal  of denuclearization is achieved.</p><p> Koji Tsurouka joins me now in the studio.  Thank you, Ambassador, for being  with us.  Do you think the summit is going to happen in the end on June  12th?  We are getting whiplash everyday -- </p><p> KOJI TSUROUKA, JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.:  I couldn't say, you know,  it was just, we just heard the president saying, well, we'll just have to  see what happens.</p><p> GORANI:  Because every day it seems like we are getting a different message  and a development that contradicts the one from the day before.  So, it's  hard to keep up.  When you are Japan and you are so directly concerned with  what's going on and you look to the messages from America, do you find it  confusing sometimes?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  Not necessarily.  The summit itself, we were hoping, and we  still have hope that if it indeed it happens, it will -- it should be able  to deliver what the world has been seeking all this time and there's been a  series of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted and they  are all aiming at having a complete verifiable, irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.</p><p> So, if this target and goal can be brought close by having a meeting, of  course, I am sure that the meeting will be very productive.</p><p> GORANI:  Japan wants to continue pressure on North Korea to change its  policies, to ultimately denuclearize.  What does that exactly mean?  What  is Japan's role here in this process?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  We are, of course, neighbors to both North and South Korea, but  we have had many contacts in the past, bilaterally with the North Koreans,  which include the issue of abduction of the Japanese nationals.</p><p> Five have returned with Prime Minister Kouzumi (ph) visited Pyongyang, but  we still have many more remaining unaccounted.  And this is another issue  that we are continuing to try to resolve.</p><p> [15:15:05] And we have said that we will be happy to engage with the North  Koreans provided that there will be complete denuclearization of North  Korea, as well as all of the abolishing ballistic missiles of all range.</p><p> GORANI:  But it doesn't sound like Kim Jong-un is up for that.  I mean,  when the idea was floated of the Libya model by John Bolton, the national  security adviser, which, of course, in 2003-2004 was a model that led to  Libya surrendering basically all of its nuclear capability.</p><p> That clearly angered North Korea.  They don't see denuclearization in the  same light as America does or as you are describing.  It doesn't sound like  everyone is on the same page.</p><p> TSUROUKA:  That is not necessarily very surprising.  For example, you're  not interviewing a North Korean.</p><p> GORANI:  I know but what you're saying is your end goal is not the end goal  of the North Koreans.  So where do you -- at some point a compromise needs  to be made or there is no deal.</p><p> TSUROUKA:  Well, you have to ask the North Koreans what their end goal is.   Yes, I think you're quite right, Hala, they do not say in public that they  are ready to accept the terms that the U.N. Security Council has adopted  unanimously.</p><p> And the same time, they said they are willing to meet with President Trump  and President Trump responded positively.  And this is the start of this  talk about summit and then there have been two visits by the secretary of  state, first as the director of CIA, then after being confirmed as the  secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo has been to Pyongyang twice.  And this is no  light matter.</p><p> GORANI:  Yes.  Are you -- of course, some of these missiles tests -- some  of these missiles actually landed very close to Japan, just a few dozen  miles off your coast.  I mean, do you feel like there is an existential  threat against your country by North Korea?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  We absolutely believe that this is a real threat to our  security, and not just for Japan, but for the region and for the whole  world at last, and this is why the U.N. is taking these very strong  sanctions until such time as they will be totally denuclearized and then  able to cooperate in peace.</p><p> GORANI:  Would anything less than total denuclearization satisfy you?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  We are not prepared to accept North Korean being recognized as a  nuclear weapons state.</p><p> GORANI:  But a nuclear program that is not weaponized?  I mean, things like  that or is it total denuclearization?  In which case, the reason I ask is  if that's the end goal, it seems like it would be a very long and  potentially fruitless process as the North Koreans don't seem to be willing  to go that far.</p><p> TSUROUKA:  Which we have been engaged for the last 20 years and we've been  trying to help them reach that goal, but so far, we haven't been  successful.  But that doesn't mean we have no goal at all.  And that's why  this summit may, if happens, be a productive summit.</p><p> GORANI:  And lastly, do you think -- because we're talking about 20 years,  and we've been covering it for 20 years, these talks and this process.   There were the six-party talks that didn't really achieve the desired  result.  Do you think that the U.S. -- the current U.S. President Donald  Trump is effective in his strategy with North Korea?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  I'm sure that Mr. Trump, the president, has made his views very  clear.  There's been numerous meetings with the Japanese prime minister,  Shinzo Abe, bilaterally, and they've discussed these issue in great depths.   So, I think Mr. Trump is more aware of the North Korean issue than any  other president that preceded him.</p><p> GORANI:  That's interesting.  So, you think more so than Barack Obama?   That he's more are, more on top of what needs to be done?</p><p> TSUROUKA:  I think (inaudible) wouldn't have missed any point in many of  the meetings that they had bilaterally among the two of them.  And there's  been a number of them starting with his visit to the Trump Tower in New  York.  This is the issue that my prime minister and my people are very  concerned about.</p><p> GORANI:  Ambassador Koji Tsurouka, thank you very much for joining us in  this studio.  We appreciate it.</p><p> Mr. Trump called off the summit just as North Korea was making a dramatic  goodwill gesture and invited journalists, including CNN's Will Ripley to  watch what it calls the destruction of a nuclear test site.  Will filed  this report on his extraordinary journey inside North Korea, a trip, as  always, that was tightly controlled.  Take a look.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm here at North Korea's  nuclear test site at Pyunggeri, a place foreign journalists have never been  allowed before.  We are here, the North Korean government says to witness  the destruction of the site.  They say it will never be able to be used  again.</p><p> (voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes.  We travel  around 15 hours to get here.  First, by bus, through the coastal city of  Wonsan.  Compartment seven here we are.  Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p> (on camera):  It is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm  having dinner on a train going through North Korea.</p><p> (voice-over):  A luxury ride, by North Korean standards.</p><p> (on camera):  They just came through and they closed all of the blinds and  told us that for the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the  windows.</p><p> (voice-over):  We pulled into Pyunggeri Station.  Then begin the nearly  two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way.</p><p> (on camera):  We passed through a number of what look like small farming  villages.  There was no sign of life.  Completely empty except for the  handful of soldiers at the guard posts along the way.</p><p> (voice-over):  We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's  Nuclear Weapons Institute.  He won't tell us his name.  Then we are allowed  to inspect the tunnels.  North Korea says they could have easily conducted  more nuclear tests here.  They say two tunnels have never been used.</p><p> (on camera):  So, they say by rigging with explosives and blowing it up,  that is a meaningful step towards denuclearization.</p><p> (voice-over):  No nuclear weapons experts in our small group, only  journalists.</p><p> (on camera):  It's actually quite beautiful here.  The North Koreans say  that the eco system hasn't been damaged by all these nuclear tests for more  than decade.  They say no radiation has seeped out.  Journalists aren't  allowed to carry radiation detectors ourselves.  They were taken away at  the airport, so we have to take their word for it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK.</p><p> RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you are witnessing history here,  which is why we are documenting every single building on this site because  by the end of the day, it will all be gone.</p><p> (voice-over):  We hiked to an observation post, built just for us and watch  Pyunggeri go up in smoke.  Will Ripley, CNN, Pyunggeri Nuclear Test Site,  North Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GORANI:  Incredible access.

Two suspects walked into an Indian restaurant at around 10:30 last night  and they detonated an improvised device before fleeing in a car.</p><p> Two parties were happening in the restaurant at the time of the explosion.   There they are, by the way.  This is security footage of the two men.   Local police say there's no indication that this is a hate crime, but they  haven't ruled anything out, very strange, though.  Two men walked in and  just throw explosives in an Indian restaurant.  No idea why, here they are  at this point.</p><p> Polls are open still as Irish voters decide whether to ease some of the  strictest abortion laws in Europe.

Samuel Burke  has our story.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max  Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade.  And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p> MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of try to ignore it and get away with  it.</p><p> BURKE:  Schrem's who helped write the regulation says he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p> SCHREMS:  This idea, if we don't want this, we think it's stupid, so we  don't want to comply with it and there's obvious business interests.  There  are certain things you simply can do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p> BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity, and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  According to  legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p> MICHAEL VOOLE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UCL:  On your Facebook profile,  you can put in things like sexuality, religion, or political beliefs.  And  if you put that on you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to  personalize contents, (inaudible) advertising and so on.  There is an  accept button.  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.  Exactly, you got  it.</p><p> BURKE:  The deal says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from  your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data  has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps  that also sent over to Facebook.</p><p> BURKE (on camera):  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook  from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these  inferences without explicit consent.</p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly.  For a big company like  Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of  its global annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook  could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the  new law.</p><p> (voice-over):  In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer says  the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access,  download, and delete their information.</p><p> The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to  stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other  websites and apps.</p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.</p><p> BURKE:  Lawyer, Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.</p><p> SCHREMS:  If we enforce it properly, we can get a balance in this in the  end, you as a customer have the possibility of using Facebook without  worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p> BURKE:  However, the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [15:30:15] GORANI:  While other companies are not playing by EU rules.  At  least not yet.  Some media sites, for instance, and some publishing groups  are blocking EU access, meaning that the continent no longer has access to  news pages like the LA Times.  That's what you get when you're in the EU  and you try to access the Los Angeles Times.  The Chicago Tribune or the  New York Daily News.  The publishers say they're looking for a way to open  up once again to Europeans, basically complying to European requirements  under GDPR.</p><p> Still to come tonight, it was on, now it was off, now it's up in the air.   We'll look at the efforts to get the U.S./North Korea summit back on track.</p><p> And then, not exactly what North Korea wants to see.  The U.S. and South  Korea are flexing their military might, conducting drills right in  Pyongyang's backyard.  We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  One thing we know for certain today about the U.S.-North Korean  summit is a definite maybe.  Both Washington and Pyongyang are keeping  hopes alive that the historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un  may happen after all.  Yesterday, the U.S. president abruptly called of the  talks scheduled for June 12th in Singapore, accusing North Korea of open  hostility.  The U.S. and South Korea just conducted annual military drills  that never failed to anger the North.  CNN's Paula Hancocks got exclusive  access to film the exercises and filed this report from an airbase in South  Korea.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles onto an F-16 fighter  jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat and imaginary enemy.</p><p> HANCOCKS:  Yes, this is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drill that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations the South and  the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p> COL. DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in  the background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder.  The  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is what  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as alliance.</p><p> HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang cancel high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, \"An intentional military provocation.\"  The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled.  But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p> [15:35:14] The situation on the Korean peninsula right now really could not  be more different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were  last held.</p><p> But for those involve in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S. Air  Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant.  The most important thing  despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for anything.</p><p> Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise.  A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p> South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over according to  aides.  But a lot has changed since then.  It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse.</p><p> But what is clear is that these types of drills infuriate Pyongyang, year- in, year-out.</p><p> Paula Hancocks, CNN, the Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GORANI:  Donald Trump has built an entire reputation on deal-making.  He  calls himself the ultimate negotiator, who can get things done when no one  else can.  Could his unorthodox style actually pay off in the diplomatic  effort with North Korea?  Let's bring in CNN's global affairs  correspondent, Elise Labott, and CNN global affairs analyst, Joseph Yun.</p><p> Joseph Yun, let me start with you.  I mean, this is whiplash diplomacy.   One day it's on, the next day is off, the third day it's maybe.  Is this a  strategy or is this a lack of strategy?  How do you read this kind of up  and down trajectory?</p><p> JOSEPH YUN, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, I would lean towards the  latter, myself.  I think it's been clear from the beginning that really  there wasn't enough contact.  What we are seeing is two narratives  colliding.  On the one hand, there is really the personal investment of  President Trump, as well as, I would say Kim Jong-un to make history.  On  the other hand, you know, it is very clear that the positions of Washington  and Pyongyang are so far apart that those under them, those working for  them are having a hard time seeing whether this summit could succeed so  they are concluding that no summit is better than bad summit, but there are  -- there is the personal ambition of President Trump to make history, to  make something in a major league foreign policy area.  So that's why we're  seeing the rollercoaster ride.</p><p> GORANI:  And, Elise, is it revivable, the summit, for June 12th in  Singapore?</p><p> ELISE LABOTT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  I mean, look, I don't  think any U.S. officials that we've spoken to, myself or my colleagues at  CNN, the only person that thinks that having it on June 12th, which is just  weeks away, is a good idea, except President Trump.  </p><p> I mean, there are some officials that think that it was a good idea for  President Trump to delay it because either, a, he wasn't going to get much  out of this summit or, b, he has a little bit more of kind of an upper hand  now.  But if the reasons for him pulling out where the fact that he doesn't  have much clarity on what Kim Jong-un is willing to put on the table, I  think he still doesn't have that kind of clarity.  </p><p> There haven't been -- we tend to forget, Hala, that these usually  negotiators kind of do this from the bottom up and negotiate or  communicate.  There's been no draft floating around.  I still think they're  kind of both flying blind as to what the other is really -- what the bottom  line is.  So I think there is a desire to have a summit at some point.  You  know, President Trump certainly wants to keep hope alive that it'll be June  12th.  But I think by anyone's standards, having it on June 12th doesn't  set the president up for the kind of success that he says he wants.</p><p> GORANI:  Joseph Yun, you've worked on the North Korea question in  government, and Elise is describing usually the diplomatic initiatives,  which you're so familiar with and for those of us who have covered these  stories as well.  You'll usually have advanced teams, you'll have mid-level  talks, they'll try to iron out some sort of announcement before the summit  even takes place, and then work toward that.  It appears there's been none  of that in this particular case.  How do you think that impacts things  going forward?</p><p> YUN:  I think that's a really big negative.  That there has been no prep  work done for this summit, at least prep work on substantive level.  We've  seen two trips by Secretary Pompeo, one when he was director of CIA, and  then one later.  And those, I think allowed for some exchange, but really,  no clarity on really serious issues like how long should denuclearization  take?  What is the definition of denuclearization?</p><p> [15:40:09] GORANI:  And that's important.  That's the most important thing.   I just spoke to the Japanese ambassador to the U.K., and I asked him that  very question, Elise and Joseph.  When you ask for total denuclearization  of North Korea and it really, we know from what the North Koreans have said  that this not something that they would consider, going as far as total  denuclearization -- having define the end goal yet, we -- get there, Elise.</p><p> LABOTT:  And also, you know, what would - how long - As Joe said, how long  would it take, do the North Koreans have to do it all in -- over a period  of time before they get any kind of benefits to the so-called agreement?   Or is it going to be an action for action as the North Koreans have wanted  some for so many years, they want to take like little small steps like the  lowest common denominator and then get all these frontloading, all of these  economic and security benefits and what U.S. officials say is -- and you  heard Secretary Pompeo said the other day, no.  It's not going to be over  an extended period of time where North Korea can get the benefits without  having to do kind of like Iran did and the deal that President Trump said  was a bad deal and that he pulled out.</p><p> Unfortunately, President Trump seems to be setting him up, at least in word  himself up, at least by what he says for the same kind of deal then he  pulled out with Iran by saying, oh, you know, I'd like them in one -- at  one go, but maybe it'll have to be overtime.  So I don't even think the  U.S. is really clear about what kind of agreement they want to have with  the North Koreans and what that kind of denuclearization looks like - like  looks like for them.  We all kind of float the word around denuclearization  but it's kind of one of those buzzwords that could mean so many things to  so many different countries.</p><p> GORANI:  And Donald Trump had this to say, by the way, about America's  standing in the world with regards to its foreign policy.  Listen.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You are now leaders in the  most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet, the United  States military.  And we are respected again, I can tell you.  We are  respected again.</p><p> And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago,  abroad, America is back.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GORANI:  Joseph Yun, this is a light motif of his.  I wonder abroad and  internationally, what Donald Trump is saying, how has received outside of  the United States?</p><p> YUN:  Well, there is some element of threat, you know.  And I think we  cannot take that lightly.  I mean, you know, President Trump is absolutely  right.  The arsenal, the military projection that we have in the United  States is far greater than anyone else.  So there is no doubt when North  Koreans hear it or the Chinese hear it, there is an edge to it that, you  know, that we cannot dismiss so easily.</p><p> LABOTT:  But if I could, Hala, I think that's true.  But at the same time,  I think the U.S. military has always been respected.  The United States has  always been respected as the greatest force in the world.  I think the new  dynamic is the unpredictability of President Trump.  And while, you know,  maybe there was a loss of respect for some of the kind of inaction or  dithering that one might say was under President Obama.  Now, this is kind  of unpredictability that maybe countries aren't respecting but they're  certainly taking a lot more notice and having to pay a lot closer attention  because otherwise, as you said it'll be whiplash for them.</p><p> GORANI:  Thanks, Elise Labott and Joseph Yun and thanks so much to both of  you for joining us this evening.</p><p> Still to come tonight, Amazon's Alexa is listening in.  It's recording what  you're saying and then it sends the recording to a co-worker.  This is not  a bad dream.  It happens.  And Amazon is feeling the heat for it.</p><p> And who calls?  Not a prime minister.  The prank call that fooled this man,  the U.K. foreign secretary.  We'll play some of it for you, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> [15:45:33] GORANI:  In London, the U.K. foreign office is not amused after  two Russian pranksters duped the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.  And  then was pretending to be the new Armenian prime minister.  And he managed  to have an 18-minute conversation with Johnson.  The call covered relations  with Russia, the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the  U.K. and how to deal with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  The chat  ended when one of the pranksters advised Johnson to try a new kind of  poison.  They've since released the recording.  Listen to some of it.</p><p> BORIS JOHNSON, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY (via telephone):  It would be great  to welcome you to the U.K.  Whatever that would be convenient for you  though. I imagine you have a lot on your plate at the moment.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Thank you for your invitation and in one month I  will shape new government.  As you know, I have a meeting with President  Putin in Sochi next week.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Next week, I know it.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I need to be prepared.  I hope he will not poison me  with Novichok.</p><p> JOHNSON:  Well it's very important, I think, prime minister, that we don't  have a new Cold War.</p><p> GORANI:  It was -- I hope it will not poison me with Novichok is what the  prankster was saying and you could feel that was already awkward tension  there from the -- from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, not  necessarily knowing how to respond there to that.  It was a prankster.  And  the foreign secretary and the foreign office is not happy about that prank  call.  It lasted 18 minutes.  Imagine that.</p><p>Amazon is facing questions over its voice-assisted Alexa which powers its  Echo speakers after a woman in Portland says that her speaker recorded a  conversation with her husband, then sent to the audio file to a contact.   And I don't know how dangerous that is.  Anna Stewart has details.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then  e-mails a random person with a private conversation that took place in her  house.</p><p> Danielle, Amazon Alexa User:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion,  like immediately I'm like, I'll never plug in that device again.  I can't  trust it.</p><p> STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband  about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works  for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she received  an alarming phone call.</p><p> DANIELLE:  The person on the other line said, unplug your Alexa devices  right now.  We go run and unplugged them all and he proceeded to tell us  that he had audio files recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p> STEWART:  Amazon told CNN affiliate Kiro 7, the device misinterpreted  commands like send message and the contacts name as part of the background  conversation, and caught it in extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light out  when it was activated or if the device response at all.  Either way, it's a  case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just  who or what they bring into the house.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> [15:50:57] GORANI:  So Seth Fiegerman has been following this from New  York.  So I don't have an Alexa.  Exactly, how did this happen?  The  machine, the speaker misunderstood from the couple who command to sell this  -- sorry.  Send this audio file?</p><p> SETH FIEGERMAN, CNN SENIOR TECH REPORTER:  Well, the way Alexa works  generally is it picks up voice cues in order to provide you with the  information that you want.  In this case, Amazon is saying that it  overheard parts of a conversation and mishear words like Alexa to turn it  on, send a message to start cueing up a message.  And even the name of a  contact to send that message to.  It's a reminder that these products are  always listening to you.  But the intention after providing you a certain  convenience and yet, they're not perfect and might mishear things and  ultimately cause you a great inconvenience.</p><p> GORANI:  But it seems like telling Alexa to turn itself on to then, you  know, produce a clip of a conversation and send it to a contacts, so that  should be a very complex set of command.  The fact that all of these  commands were misunderstood in a single operation by the speaker, I don't  understand how that can happen.</p><p> FIEGERMAN:  I think a lot of people are puzzling over themselves right now.   I do think it's fair to say it's a fluke.  We've got to hear of another  example of that in the years since this product has been introduced.   Amazon calls is an extremely unlikely occurrence.  But it does raise  concerns that these things can't perfectly hear what you're saying.  You  forget that they're there.  They blend into the background and ultimately  you might accidentally trigger and inconvenient and scary occurrence.</p><p> GORANI:  Well, they're lucky that it was only a conversation about hardwood  floors right?</p><p> FIEGERMAN:  Agreed.</p><p> GORANI:  Not something else.  Seth, thanks very much for joining us.  Seth  Fiegerman.</p><p> More to come including rivers of fire beneath the ocean in Hawaii as the  eruptions continue.  We are live in Hawaii, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GORANI:  Well, the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has continued to spew lava.   You can see here the active fissures bubbling up at the surface of the big  island.  Now, streams of lava are entering the Pacific Ocean near a power  plant.  So it could be an issue.  But so far though thankfully that plant  is not endangered.  Scott McLean who is right next to some of that lava  flow joins me now live.</p><p> What's going on where you are, Scott?</p><p> SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Hala.  So people on this section of  the big island, they seemed to be playing this volcanic game of Whac-A- Mole, just when you think that things are dying down in one area, they  suddenly spring up.  And another case and point this giant fissure that you  see behind me, it's the one that we've been watching for a couple of days  now and it has shrunk substantially.  That said, there is another one that  sprung to seemingly take its place and it is pumping lava into a place that  really does not needed.  A neighborhood called Leilani Estates, a  subdivision not far from here that has been terrorized by lava since  Kilauea first woke up.  And there are also fears that we are just getting  actually in the last couple of hours, an official warnings from authorities  that another lava flow could cross a major highway in this area which would  cut off our routes, the place where I'm standing right now.  We'd have to  find an alternate route.  It also means that people in that area, on the  North side of that highway are starting to pack up and it is proving just  how unpredictable Kilauea can be.</p><p> [15:55:01] GORANI:  And so, what is -- I mean, it appears as though this  volcano is not lighting up that this is going to be a reality for that part  of Hawaii for the foreseeable future.</p><p> MCLEAN:  It seems that way.  The experts will tell you that they don't know  or at least they don't seem to know exactly at this point how long this  will last.  They can use sort of other eruptions in the past as a  historical, you know, marker.  But at the end of the day, this volcano is  going to erupt for as long as it does and they can't exactly pin down when  this will be over, when people will be able to go home.</p><p> GORANI:  And what about residents?  I can only imagine that at this point,  they must be quite fed up.</p><p> MCLEAN:  Yes.  I think -- you talked to a lot of people who may be thought  that they were OK a couple of weeks ago, thought that things were going to  be just fine and now all of a sudden, they are sort of packing up as a  precaution, especially now with this word that things have crossed -- or  maybe crossing the highway.</p><p> Quickly, Hala, I also spoke to a gentleman who had two homes, that he has  fully expected would get swallowed up by the lava, but a man Darryl Clinton  actually protected them.  He is the guy who got hit by a lava bomb.  I  caught up with the homeowner of those homes that he was protecting  yesterday.  Here's what he said.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT:  We approached this, I think the way you're  supposed to.  We spoke to out Hawaiian friends in Kalapana.  And, you know,  you clean house for them.  You prepare and then you -- you're not in  charge.  And I think that Darryl and Lisa, Mark no doubt about us and we  left with a humble hope that we would be able to be back and I think  nature's wanted to help, wanted to facilitate in any way that they could,  you know.  It's hard when your friend gets hurt.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCLEAN:  So, Hala, just to hammer home how extraordinary this is, the man  you heard there, he fully expected that when he left, he took all of his  furniture with them.  He thought that his two homes on that property would  be gone.  The only reason that they are there today is because of that man  named Darryl Clinton, the only person, so far, to have been injured by  Kilauea.</p><p> GORANI:  incredible.  Scott McLean, thanks very much for joining us, live  from Hawaii.</p><p> Check out Facebook page, facebook.com/halagoranicnn for more.  I'm Hala  Gorani.  Thanks for watching tonight.  If it's your weekend, have a great  weekend.  If not, have a great Saturday and Sunday.  And do stay with CNN,  \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" is coming up next after a quick break.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Live from CNN London, I'm Hala  Gorani.  Tonight, cuffed and charged with rape, disgraced movie producer,  Harvey Weinstein turns himself into police today accused of multiple sexual  crimes against women.  We are live in New York.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, ahead, a day after canceling the North Korea summit, Donald Trump now  says it could still happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus, an investigation is underway at downing street after the U.K. foreign  secretary spent almost 20 minutes on the phone with a prank caller.  We  have the reporting for you.</p><p>For decades, Harvey Weinstein was one of the most powerful men in the movie  business capable of launching or destroying careers.  Just a few hours ago,  the now-disgraced movie producer appeared in a New York court, charged with  rape and other sex crimes against two women.</p><p>These criminal charges are the first against him after allegations of  sexual misconduct for more than 80 women last fall.  Weinstein left the  hearing, his bond set at $10 million.  His bail at $1 million.  He's  required to wear a monitoring device and had to surrender his passport.</p><p>And more charges are expected, but just after the hearing, Weinstein's  attorney claimed the state is going to have a hard time proving its case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S ATTORNEY:  He has vehemently denied  any of the allegations, which suggest that he engaged in non-consensual  sexual activity.  I anticipate that the women who have made these  allegations, when subjected to cross-examination, in the event we even get  that far, that the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we  get 12 fair people, who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have  overtaken this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Well, this is the attorney for Harvey Weinstein.  And when the  widespread allegations against Weinstein became public last year, it  sparked a global reckoning about sex abuse and harassment.  The  #metoomovement was born.</p><p>Correspondent, Brynn Gingras, joins me now from New York with more.  So,  where does this go from here?  I mean, essentially Harvey Weinstein was  freed on $1 million bail.  He has to wear an ankle bracelet or a monitoring  device.  What happens now?</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Hala, really, this is  only the beginning for Harvey Weinstein because investigations are still  ongoing in London.  We have one also in Los Angeles, and then we also know  there's a federal probe happening here in New York and last week, we  learned that there is a grand jury that's been convened.</p><p>And they've been hearing testimony from at least four women accusers, as  well as evidence.  And so, there are more charges that could be coming down  the pipeline for Harvey Weinstein.  So, this is really just the beginning  of his legal battle.</p><p>But, yes, you outlined perfectly the conditions of his bail.  He is out on  bail.  We do believe he did go to a home in Connecticut.  But of course,  with that ankle monitoring bracelets, authorities will have -- will able to  keep track of him 24/7.</p><p>GORANI:  And what -- specifically with this case, what are the next steps  now for him?</p><p>GINGRAS:  Well, for this case specifically, he has to appear in court next  month.  But we are going to learn next week from his attorney, who you  already heard there, Ben Brafman, if he's going to testify to that grand  jury.  Again, those proceedings have been ongoing for weeks.</p><p>And it's very possible we'll get more charges.  So, it will be interesting  to see.  Of course, those are closed -- those will be closed to the public.   But it will be interesting to see if Weinstein goes forward to those jurors  in those proceedings.</p><p>GORANI:  And Brynn, stand by.  Rose McGowan, who is, of course, one of the  initial Weinstein accusers, who says she was one of his victims, had this  to say in reaction to the developments today.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Do you think he thought this day would come?</p><p>ROSE MCGOWAN, ACTRESS:  No.  No, he did not.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Because the system was created to protect men like  him?</p><p>MCGOWAN:  The system was created by men like him and his accomplices to  protect him.  It's tragic that it takes over a hundred women, and that  probably means like a thousand, let's be real.  I mean, this man had  hunting grounds all over the world and he had accomplices and a complicity  machine.  You know, he was the cult leader of Hollywood.  There will always  be sociopaths and predators like Harvey Weinstein, but I find his  complicity machine a lot more guilty.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[15:05:12] GORANI:  That's Rose McGowan.  Brynn, I was curious, because you  did mention that there were other cases potentially brewing.  Was there  anyone in the courtroom today there to support Weinstein?  Did he have any  family members, any friends, anyone there with him or was he all alone  facing these charges?</p><p>GINGRAS:  No, he was pretty much all alone.  It's also important to note  that there are actually no victims in the courtroom that we know of either.   But, yes, he was all alone.  People described him inside the courtroom as  being a little bit dazed, out of it, as he faced that judge.</p><p>I do want to point out, since you played that Rose McGowan (inaudible), Ben  Brafman, his attorney, when he came out here and spoke to the media, he  made a very striking comments about these accusations.</p><p>Basically, saying that he defends his clients on facts, on criminal  charges, and not just accusations.  That his client, Harvey Weinstein,  didn't invent the casting couch in Hollywood, almost defending him, that  he's not the only person who has done things like this, possibly even  setting up a defense, which we might see if and when this goes to trial --  Hala.</p><p>GORANI:  Brynn Gingras, thanks very much, outside the courtroom, the  courthouse there in New York, where Harvey Weinstein faced a judge and  posted $1 million bail there.  He is free on bail for now.</p><p>So, what is next for Harvey Weinstein in dealing with sex misconduct  charges that can be very difficult to prove in court?</p><p>Joining me now, also from New York, is our legal analyst, Joey Jackson.   He's a criminal defense attorney.  What did you make of what the lawyer  said?  He basically said, you know, we're going to have to prove this.   We're going to have to convince the prosecution.</p><p>We'll have to convince 12 jurors if they are fair jurors, essentially  blaming, it sounded like, the \"Me Too Movement\" for, you know, maybe  brainwashing people into thinking some men did bad things when in fact they  didn't.  What did you make of that?</p><p>JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Well, you know, Hala, a couple of things.   First of all, I should say, that I'm a product of that Manhattan District  Attorney's Office, the one that's prosecuting him now, Sy Vans is in  charge.  Morgan (inaudible) was in charge when I was there although Ben  Brafman was a significant presence.</p><p>He was part of our training when I was an assistant district attorney when  he was a defense attorney.  So very well respected, very highly regarded  and come out swinging, right?  That's what he did.  That's what he taught  everyone else to do.</p><p>And here's the reality.  You have a distinction that he's trying to make  between bad behavior on the one hand, which apparently is rampant in  Hollywood, and what he is suggesting that as the attorney, as criminal  behavior on the other.</p><p>Remember that he said that it was no time that his client engaged in  conduct that was not otherwise consensual.  And so, I think that will be  the refrain here.  In addition to that, he also, Ben Brafman, his defense  attorney, is saying that I'm challenging the sufficiency of any evidence he  has as it relates to the complaint.</p><p>I'm making a motion to dismiss.  And I think he's going to predicate that  motion upon factual allegations that can't be substantiated to this point,  as well as perhaps, Hala, some statute of limitations issues.</p><p>Remember that one allegation goes back to 2004, so there's a question as to  whether that's viable now.  So, the attorney is in full swing mode, full  defense mode, and I think we'll see a lot of that in the days, weeks, and  months to come.</p><p>GORANI:  Because in court, and this is always something that people who say  there are victims of rape and sex abuse in court, it is -- I mean, it is  difficult to prove rape, right, in a courtroom, in a court of law?</p><p>JACKSON:  You know what, Hala, it could be, and it also depends upon when  the rape happened in conjunction with when the crime was actually leveled  against you.  Often times, if it's more recent, they do rape kits, there's  analysis, there's DNA, there's some type of connection to connect the  person accused to the actual accuser.</p><p>In this case, because of one happening in 2013, I doubt that will be the  case.  Another one in 2004, I doubt that will be the case.  And you heard  Ben Brafman say, he will cross-examine them.</p><p>In our system that means you challenge the sufficiency of the witness's  recollection, you challenge what their course of events they suggest are.   And I think he'll go after them, you know, pretty aggressively.</p><p>But there are expert witnesses, who will testify in these cases, which are  hard to prove, that there are reasons why women don't come forward right  away.  There are reasons of humiliation, reasons of shame, there are  reasons of embarrassment, there's reasons they blame themselves.</p><p>And I have tried sex cases where, in fact, those experts come and they're  very persuasive and explain to the jury what women feel when they are  violated.</p><p>GORANI:  And it just feels like now with the \"Me Too Movement\" perhaps some  of these concepts are better understood by the wider public as to why  people don't necessarily come forward right away.</p><p>I want to show our viewers the charges that Harvey Weinstein is facing.  We  have some graphics made up here, detailing those for our viewers.  The  charges explained rape in the first degree.</p><p>[15:10:05] There are also a couple of other charges that we can put up  there related to alleged sexual abuse, criminal sexual act in the first  degree as well as a third charge, which we're going to put up there as well  for our viewers.</p><p>And then rape in the third-degree.  So, what do you make of these charges?   What -- how differently would a defense attorney or a prosecutor, in fact,  tackle this case, based on these charges that we've told our viewers about?</p><p>JACKSON:  Well, you know what, Hala?  The first thing to make mention of is  that those are very significant charges.  They are \"B\" felonies.  In  English, what that means is a person convicted can face 25 years in jail,  at least as to the first-degree accounts, Rape in the first degree,  forcible compulsion in the first-degree.</p><p>The other one, there's no mandatory jail time, but you know, you're not  worried about that when you're worried about the others.  So, obviously,  with Ben Brafman setting up, the defense attorney, the defense of, if  things did occur and you credit any victims' claims that it was consensual,  that he didn't take advantage of them.</p><p>That's lot to overcome, though, because we're in a different cliate.  And  I'm going to be looking for as matters move forward, we are not there yet,  we are not at trial.  We haven't even had a grand jury indictment, but I'm  interested in knowing how many other accusers if any the judge will allow  to testify.</p><p>That can be compelling evidence.  We've had occasion to speak about Bill  Cosby in the past.  And remember in his trial, five prior accusers  testified.  That weighs heavily on a jury because they're looking and  they're saying, hey, this maybe your M.O. so I'm going to be looking for in  the event the case moves forward, Hala, how many other victims the judge  will permit to testify.</p><p>GORANI:  That's going to be very interesting.  Joey Jackson, thanks, as  always, for your analysis on this.</p><p>JACKSON:  Of course.</p><p>GORANI:  Now to international diplomacy and the North Korean situation.  A  day ago, he gave North Korea the cold shoulder, but today Donald Trump is  warming up once again to the idea of a historic summit with Kim Jong-un.</p><p>The American president is now leaving the possibility open after he  abruptly canceled talks scheduled for June 12th, accusing Pyongyang, of  quote, \"open hostility.\"  North Korea responded with a perhaps surprising  conciliatory statement, saying it is ready to meet Mr. Trump at any time.</p><p>He welcomed that gesture as warm and productive and acknowledged to  reporters that, quote, \"Everybody plays games.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:  We're going to  see what happens.  We're talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement  that they put out.  We'll see what happens.  We'll see what happens.  It  could even be the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want  to do it.  We'd like to do it.  We're going to see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Mr. Trump has made it a top foreign policy priority to convince  North Korea to fully denuclearize.  Unclear if North Korea would be up for  that.  It doesn't sound like it from their statements in the past.</p><p>The entire region, of course, is concerned.  In fact, Japan's ambassador to  the U.K. says the summit itself is not that important as long as the goal  of denuclearization is achieved.</p><p>Koji Tsurouka joins me now in the studio.  Thank you, Ambassador, for being  with us.  Do you think the summit is going to happen in the end on June  12th?  We are getting whiplash everyday -- </p><p>KOJI TSUROUKA, JAPANESE AMBASSADOR TO THE U.K.:  I couldn't say, you know,  it was just, we just heard the president saying, well, we'll just have to  see what happens.</p><p>GORANI:  Because every day it seems like we are getting a different message  and a development that contradicts the one from the day before.  So, it's  hard to keep up.  When you are Japan and you are so directly concerned with  what's going on and you look to the messages from America, do you find it  confusing sometimes?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  Not necessarily.  The summit itself, we were hoping, and we  still have hope that if it indeed it happens, it will -- it should be able  to deliver what the world has been seeking all this time and there's been a  series of U.N. Security Council resolutions that have been adopted and they  are all aiming at having a complete verifiable, irreversible  denuclearization of North Korea.</p><p>So, if this target and goal can be brought close by having a meeting, of  course, I am sure that the meeting will be very productive.</p><p>GORANI:  Japan wants to continue pressure on North Korea to change its  policies, to ultimately denuclearize.  What does that exactly mean?  What  is Japan's role here in this process?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  We are, of course, neighbors to both North and South Korea, but  we have had many contacts in the past, bilaterally with the North Koreans,  which include the issue of abduction of the Japanese nationals.</p><p>Five have returned with Prime Minister Kouzumi (ph) visited Pyongyang, but  we still have many more remaining unaccounted.  And this is another issue  that we are continuing to try to resolve.</p><p>[15:15:05] And we have said that we will be happy to engage with the North  Koreans provided that there will be complete denuclearization of North  Korea, as well as all of the abolishing ballistic missiles of all range.</p><p>GORANI:  But it doesn't sound like Kim Jong-un is up for that.  I mean,  when the idea was floated of the Libya model by John Bolton, the national  security adviser, which, of course, in 2003-2004 was a model that led to  Libya surrendering basically all of its nuclear capability.</p><p>That clearly angered North Korea.  They don't see denuclearization in the  same light as America does or as you are describing.  It doesn't sound like  everyone is on the same page.</p><p>TSUROUKA:  That is not necessarily very surprising.  For example, you're  not interviewing a North Korean.</p><p>GORANI:  I know but what you're saying is your end goal is not the end goal  of the North Koreans.  So where do you -- at some point a compromise needs  to be made or there is no deal.</p><p>TSUROUKA:  Well, you have to ask the North Koreans what their end goal is.   Yes, I think you're quite right, Hala, they do not say in public that they  are ready to accept the terms that the U.N. Security Council has adopted  unanimously.</p><p>And the same time, they said they are willing to meet with President Trump  and President Trump responded positively.  And this is the start of this  talk about summit and then there have been two visits by the secretary of  state, first as the director of CIA, then after being confirmed as the  secretary of state, Mr. Pompeo has been to Pyongyang twice.  And this is no  light matter.</p><p>GORANI:  Yes.  Are you -- of course, some of these missiles tests -- some  of these missiles actually landed very close to Japan, just a few dozen  miles off your coast.  I mean, do you feel like there is an existential  threat against your country by North Korea?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  We absolutely believe that this is a real threat to our  security, and not just for Japan, but for the region and for the whole  world at last, and this is why the U.N. is taking these very strong  sanctions until such time as they will be totally denuclearized and then  able to cooperate in peace.</p><p>GORANI:  Would anything less than total denuclearization satisfy you?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  We are not prepared to accept North Korean being recognized as a  nuclear weapons state.</p><p>GORANI:  But a nuclear program that is not weaponized?  I mean, things like  that or is it total denuclearization?  In which case, the reason I ask is  if that's the end goal, it seems like it would be a very long and  potentially fruitless process as the North Koreans don't seem to be willing  to go that far.</p><p>TSUROUKA:  Which we have been engaged for the last 20 years and we've been  trying to help them reach that goal, but so far, we haven't been  successful.  But that doesn't mean we have no goal at all.  And that's why  this summit may, if happens, be a productive summit.</p><p>GORANI:  And lastly, do you think -- because we're talking about 20 years,  and we've been covering it for 20 years, these talks and this process.   There were the six-party talks that didn't really achieve the desired  result.  Do you think that the U.S. -- the current U.S. President Donald  Trump is effective in his strategy with North Korea?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  I'm sure that Mr. Trump, the president, has made his views very  clear.  There's been numerous meetings with the Japanese prime minister,  Shinzo Abe, bilaterally, and they've discussed these issue in great depths.   So, I think Mr. Trump is more aware of the North Korean issue than any  other president that preceded him.</p><p>GORANI:  That's interesting.  So, you think more so than Barack Obama?   That he's more are, more on top of what needs to be done?</p><p>TSUROUKA:  I think (inaudible) wouldn't have missed any point in many of  the meetings that they had bilaterally among the two of them.  And there's  been a number of them starting with his visit to the Trump Tower in New  York.  This is the issue that my prime minister and my people are very  concerned about.</p><p>GORANI:  Ambassador Koji Tsurouka, thank you very much for joining us in  this studio.  We appreciate it.</p><p>Mr. Trump called off the summit just as North Korea was making a dramatic  goodwill gesture and invited journalists, including CNN's Will Ripley to  watch what it calls the destruction of a nuclear test site.  Will filed  this report on his extraordinary journey inside North Korea, a trip, as  always, that was tightly controlled.  Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I'm here at North Korea's  nuclear test site at Pyunggeri, a place foreign journalists have never been  allowed before.  We are here, the North Korean government says to witness  the destruction of the site.  They say it will never be able to be used  again.</p><p>(voice-over):  With each powerful explosion, the earth shakes.  We travel  around 15 hours to get here.  First, by bus, through the coastal city of  Wonsan.  Compartment seven here we are.  Then, some 12 hours by train.</p><p>(on camera):  It is one of those moments where you blink and realize I'm  having dinner on a train going through North Korea.</p><p>(voice-over):  A luxury ride, by North Korean standards.</p><p>(on camera):  They just came through and they closed all of the blinds and  told us that for the entire train ride, we can't film anything out the  windows.</p><p>(voice-over):  We pulled into Pyunggeri Station.  Then begin the nearly  two-hour drive to the test site.  Once again, no filming along the way.</p><p>(on camera):  We passed through a number of what look like small farming  villages.  There was no sign of life.  Completely empty except for the  handful of soldiers at the guard posts along the way.</p><p>(voice-over):  We get a briefing from the deputy director of North Korea's  Nuclear Weapons Institute.  He won't tell us his name.  Then we are allowed  to inspect the tunnels.  North Korea says they could have easily conducted  more nuclear tests here.  They say two tunnels have never been used.</p><p>(on camera):  So, they say by rigging with explosives and blowing it up,  that is a meaningful step towards denuclearization.</p><p>(voice-over):  No nuclear weapons experts in our small group, only  journalists.</p><p>(on camera):  It's actually quite beautiful here.  The North Koreans say  that the eco system hasn't been damaged by all these nuclear tests for more  than decade.  They say no radiation has seeped out.  Journalists aren't  allowed to carry radiation detectors ourselves.  They were taken away at  the airport, so we have to take their word for it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The dismantling of the nuclear  test grounds conducted with high level of transparency has clearly attested  once again to the proactive and peace-loving efforts of the government of  the DPRK.</p><p>RIPLEY:  You really do get the sense that you are witnessing history here,  which is why we are documenting every single building on this site because  by the end of the day, it will all be gone.</p><p>(voice-over):  We hiked to an observation post, built just for us and watch  Pyunggeri go up in smoke.  Will Ripley, CNN, Pyunggeri Nuclear Test Site,  North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI:  Incredible access.  A remarkable report there from deep inside  North Korea on CNN.</p><p>Still to come, two men who are on the run after setting off an explosive  device in Canada, still not found.  We have details next.</p><p>And DGPR, the four letters spamming your inbox.  The E.U.'s new privacy  laws come into play today.  How are you impacted by them, next?</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:25:23]</p><p>GORANI:  There is still an active manhunt underway in Canada, after an  explosion injured 15 people in a restaurant in Ontario, and it was brazen.   Two suspects walked into an Indian restaurant at around 10:30 last night  and they detonated an improvised device before fleeing in a car.</p><p>Two parties were happening in the restaurant at the time of the explosion.   There they are, by the way.  This is security footage of the two men.   Local police say there's no indication that this is a hate crime, but they  haven't ruled anything out, very strange, though.  Two men walked in and  just throw explosives in an Indian restaurant.  No idea why, here they are  at this point.</p><p>Polls are open still as Irish voters decide whether to ease some of the  strictest abortion laws in Europe.  The current Constitution in the mostly  Catholic country prohibits abortion in almost all cases.</p><p>If the yes campaign wins, parliament is expected to pass legislation  allowing abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy.  A no vote keeps  current restrictions in place.  And there are reporting restrictions, so  this is as far as we can go in terms of the story, but results will be  known tomorrow.  And polls close in about an hour and a half.</p><p>They are the e-mails that have been driving you, me, and everyone in  between crazy as the European Union's general data protection regulation  rolls out across the continent, some of the world's biggest companies could  already be breaking the rules.</p><p>Those are the e-mails that asking you to review companies privacy policies  that have been landing in your inbox for the last few days.  Samuel Burke  has our story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY TECHNOLOGY CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max  Schrems (ph) has been fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for  nearly a decade.  And today he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook  for allegedly violating the E.U.'s new data protection law called GDPR the  day it came into force.</p><p>MAX SCHREMS, LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that really  willfully violate the law that kind of try to ignore it and get away with  it.</p><p>BURKE:  Schrem's who helped write the regulation says he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.</p><p>SCHREMS:  This idea, if we don't want this, we think it's stupid, so we  don't want to comply with it and there's obvious business interests.  There  are certain things you simply can do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity, and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  According to  legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL VOOLE, TECHNOLOGY POLICY EXPERT, UCL:  On your Facebook profile,  you can put in things like sexuality, religion, or political beliefs.  And  if you put that on you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to  personalize contents, (inaudible) advertising and so on.  There is an  accept button.  There's not an \"I don't accept\" button.  Exactly, you got  it.</p><p>BURKE:  The deal says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from  your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data  has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps  that also sent over to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE (on camera):  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook  from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these  inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly.  For a big company like  Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of  its global annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook  could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the  new law.</p><p>(voice-over):  In a statement to CNN, Facebook's chief privacy officer says  the company has, quote, \"introduced better tools for people to access,  download, and delete their information.</p><p>The company also says it's building a new tool that will allow users to  stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other  websites and apps.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.</p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer, Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce it properly, we can get a balance in this in the  end, you as a customer have the possibility of using Facebook without  worrying 24/7 about your data.</p><p>BURKE:  However, the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:30:15] GORANI:  While other companies are not playing by EU rules.  At  least not yet.  Some media sites, for instance, and some publishing groups  are blocking EU access, meaning that the continent no longer has access to  news pages like the LA Times.  That's what you get when you're in the EU  and you try to access the Los Angeles Times.  The Chicago Tribune or the  New York Daily News.  The publishers say they're looking for a way to open  up once again to Europeans, basically complying to European requirements  under GDPR.</p><p>Still to come tonight, it was on, now it was off, now it's up in the air.   We'll look at the efforts to get the U.S./North Korea summit back on track.</p><p>And then, not exactly what North Korea wants to see.  The U.S. and South  Korea are flexing their military might, conducting drills right in  Pyongyang's backyard.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GORANI:  One thing we know for certain today about the U.S.-North Korean  summit is a definite maybe.  Both Washington and Pyongyang are keeping  hopes alive that the historic meeting between Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un  may happen after all.  Yesterday, the U.S. president abruptly called of the  talks scheduled for June 12th in Singapore, accusing North Korea of open  hostility.  The U.S. and South Korea just conducted annual military drills  that never failed to anger the North.  CNN's Paula Hancocks got exclusive  access to film the exercises and filed this report from an airbase in South  Korea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Loading missiles onto an F-16 fighter  jet, ready for a mission against an imaginary threat and imaginary enemy.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Yes, this is Max Thunder, an annual joint air force drill  between the U.S. and South Korea, the same military drill that North Korea  slammed 10 days ago as the turning point in warming relations the South and  the U.S.</p><p>CNN was able to film the exercise exclusively, which had been embargoed  until the drill ended Friday.</p><p>COL. DAVID SHOEMAKER, COMMANDER, 8TH FIGHTER WING:  While the situation in  the background has changed over the years as we've flown Max Thunder.  The  exercise itself is still there for the same reason, and that is what  tactical level and operability learning to fight together as alliance.</p><p>HANCOCKS:  Pyongyang cancel high level talks with South Korea because of  this drill, calling it, quote, \"An intentional military provocation.\"  The  first of many recent bumps in the road to a historic summit between the  U.S. and North Korean leaders that U.S. President Donald Trump has just  canceled.  But the mood is still far less tense than this time last year.</p><p>[15:35:14] The situation on the Korean peninsula right now really could not  be more different to how it was last year when this Max Thunder drills were  last held.</p><p>But for those involve in these military exercises, the pilots, the U.S. Air  Force, they say that the politics is irrelevant.  The most important thing  despite that is to make sure that they are trained and ready for anything.</p><p>Pyongyang's anger at these drills took Seoul and Washington by surprise.  A  South Korean delegation who met with Kim Jong-un said that Kim said he  understood why joint drills had to take place.</p><p>South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in Washington this week he believe  relations would be back on track once Max Thunder was over according to  aides.  But a lot has changed since then.  It's unclear if this drill was  really the reason Pyongyang cooled its enthusiasm for talks with Mr. Trump  or a convenient excuse.</p><p>But what is clear is that these types of drills infuriate Pyongyang, year- in, year-out.</p><p>Paula Hancocks, CNN, the Kunsan Air Base, South Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI:  Donald Trump has built an entire reputation on deal-making.  He  calls himself the ultimate negotiator, who can get things done when no one  else can.  Could his unorthodox style actually pay off in the diplomatic  effort with North Korea?  Let's bring in CNN's global affairs  correspondent, Elise Labott, and CNN global affairs analyst, Joseph Yun.</p><p>Joseph Yun, let me start with you.  I mean, this is whiplash diplomacy.   One day it's on, the next day is off, the third day it's maybe.  Is this a  strategy or is this a lack of strategy?  How do you read this kind of up  and down trajectory?</p><p>JOSEPH YUN, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, I would lean towards the  latter, myself.  I think it's been clear from the beginning that really  there wasn't enough contact.  What we are seeing is two narratives  colliding.  On the one hand, there is really the personal investment of  President Trump, as well as, I would say Kim Jong-un to make history.  On  the other hand, you know, it is very clear that the positions of Washington  and Pyongyang are so far apart that those under them, those working for  them are having a hard time seeing whether this summit could succeed so  they are concluding that no summit is better than bad summit, but there are  -- there is the personal ambition of President Trump to make history, to  make something in a major league foreign policy area.  So that's why we're  seeing the rollercoaster ride.</p><p>GORANI:  And, Elise, is it revivable, the summit, for June 12th in  Singapore?</p><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  I mean, look, I don't  think any U.S. officials that we've spoken to, myself or my colleagues at  CNN, the only person that thinks that having it on June 12th, which is just  weeks away, is a good idea, except President Trump.  </p><p>I mean, there are some officials that think that it was a good idea for  President Trump to delay it because either, a, he wasn't going to get much  out of this summit or, b, he has a little bit more of kind of an upper hand  now.  But if the reasons for him pulling out where the fact that he doesn't  have much clarity on what Kim Jong-un is willing to put on the table, I  think he still doesn't have that kind of clarity.  </p><p>There haven't been -- we tend to forget, Hala, that these usually  negotiators kind of do this from the bottom up and negotiate or  communicate.  There's been no draft floating around.  I still think they're  kind of both flying blind as to what the other is really -- what the bottom  line is.  So I think there is a desire to have a summit at some point.  You  know, President Trump certainly wants to keep hope alive that it'll be June  12th.  But I think by anyone's standards, having it on June 12th doesn't  set the president up for the kind of success that he says he wants.</p><p>GORANI:  Joseph Yun, you've worked on the North Korea question in  government, and Elise is describing usually the diplomatic initiatives,  which you're so familiar with and for those of us who have covered these  stories as well.  You'll usually have advanced teams, you'll have mid-level  talks, they'll try to iron out some sort of announcement before the summit  even takes place, and then work toward that.  It appears there's been none  of that in this particular case.  How do you think that impacts things  going forward?</p><p>YUN:  I think that's a really big negative.  That there has been no prep  work done for this summit, at least prep work on substantive level.  We've  seen two trips by Secretary Pompeo, one when he was director of CIA, and  then one later.  And those, I think allowed for some exchange, but really,  no clarity on really serious issues like how long should denuclearization  take?  What is the definition of denuclearization?</p><p>[15:40:09] GORANI:  And that's important.  That's the most important thing.   I just spoke to the Japanese ambassador to the U.K., and I asked him that  very question, Elise and Joseph.  When you ask for total denuclearization  of North Korea and it really, we know from what the North Koreans have said  that this not something that they would consider, going as far as total  denuclearization -- having define the end goal yet, we -- get there, Elise.</p><p>LABOTT:  And also, you know, what would - how long - As Joe said, how long  would it take, do the North Koreans have to do it all in -- over a period  of time before they get any kind of benefits to the so-called agreement?   Or is it going to be an action for action as the North Koreans have wanted  some for so many years, they want to take like little small steps like the  lowest common denominator and then get all these frontloading, all of these  economic and security benefits and what U.S. officials say is -- and you  heard Secretary Pompeo said the other day, no.  It's not going to be over  an extended period of time where North Korea can get the benefits without  having to do kind of like Iran did and the deal that President Trump said  was a bad deal and that he pulled out.</p><p>Unfortunately, President Trump seems to be setting him up, at least in word  himself up, at least by what he says for the same kind of deal then he  pulled out with Iran by saying, oh, you know, I'd like them in one -- at  one go, but maybe it'll have to be overtime.  So I don't even think the  U.S. is really clear about what kind of agreement they want to have with  the North Koreans and what that kind of denuclearization looks like - like  looks like for them.  We all kind of float the word around denuclearization  but it's kind of one of those buzzwords that could mean so many things to  so many different countries.</p><p>GORANI:  And Donald Trump had this to say, by the way, about America's  standing in the world with regards to its foreign policy.  Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  You are now leaders in the  most powerful and righteous force on the face of the planet, the United  States military.  And we are respected again, I can tell you.  We are  respected again.</p><p>And our country has regained the respect that we used to have long ago,  abroad, America is back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI:  Joseph Yun, this is a light motif of his.  I wonder abroad and  internationally, what Donald Trump is saying, how has received outside of  the United States?</p><p>YUN:  Well, there is some element of threat, you know.  And I think we  cannot take that lightly.  I mean, you know, President Trump is absolutely  right.  The arsenal, the military projection that we have in the United  States is far greater than anyone else.  So there is no doubt when North  Koreans hear it or the Chinese hear it, there is an edge to it that, you  know, that we cannot dismiss so easily.</p><p>LABOTT:  But if I could, Hala, I think that's true.  But at the same time,  I think the U.S. military has always been respected.  The United States has  always been respected as the greatest force in the world.  I think the new  dynamic is the unpredictability of President Trump.  And while, you know,  maybe there was a loss of respect for some of the kind of inaction or  dithering that one might say was under President Obama.  Now, this is kind  of unpredictability that maybe countries aren't respecting but they're  certainly taking a lot more notice and having to pay a lot closer attention  because otherwise, as you said it'll be whiplash for them.</p><p>GORANI:  Thanks, Elise Labott and Joseph Yun and thanks so much to both of  you for joining us this evening.</p><p>Still to come tonight, Amazon's Alexa is listening in.  It's recording what  you're saying and then it sends the recording to a co-worker.  This is not  a bad dream.  It happens.  And Amazon is feeling the heat for it.</p><p>And who calls?  Not a prime minister.  The prank call that fooled this man,  the U.K. foreign secretary.  We'll play some of it for you, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[15:45:33] GORANI:  In London, the U.K. foreign office is not amused after  two Russian pranksters duped the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.  And  then was pretending to be the new Armenian prime minister.  And he managed  to have an 18-minute conversation with Johnson.  The call covered relations  with Russia, the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the  U.K. and how to deal with the Russian President, Vladimir Putin.  The chat  ended when one of the pranksters advised Johnson to try a new kind of  poison.  They've since released the recording.  Listen to some of it.</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY (via telephone):  It would be great  to welcome you to the U.K.  Whatever that would be convenient for you  though. I imagine you have a lot on your plate at the moment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.  Thank you for your invitation and in one month I  will shape new government.  As you know, I have a meeting with President  Putin in Sochi next week.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Next week, I know it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I need to be prepared.  I hope he will not poison me  with Novichok.</p><p>JOHNSON:  Well it's very important, I think, prime minister, that we don't  have a new Cold War.</p><p>GORANI:  It was -- I hope it will not poison me with Novichok is what the  prankster was saying and you could feel that was already awkward tension  there from the -- from Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, not  necessarily knowing how to respond there to that.  It was a prankster.  And  the foreign secretary and the foreign office is not happy about that prank  call.  It lasted 18 minutes.  Imagine that.</p><p>Amazon is facing questions over its voice-assisted Alexa which powers its  Echo speakers after a woman in Portland says that her speaker recorded a  conversation with her husband, then sent to the audio file to a contact.   And I don't know how dangerous that is.  Anna Stewart has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon says Amazon's Alexa recorded and then  e-mails a random person with a private conversation that took place in her  house.</p><p>Danielle, Amazon Alexa User:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion,  like immediately I'm like, I'll never plug in that device again.  I can't  trust it.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle says she was chatting with her husband  about hardwood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works  for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she received  an alarming phone call.</p><p>DANIELLE:  The person on the other line said, unplug your Alexa devices  right now.  We go run and unplugged them all and he proceeded to tell us  that he had audio files recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told CNN affiliate Kiro 7, the device misinterpreted  commands like send message and the contacts name as part of the background  conversation, and caught it in extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light out  when it was activated or if the device response at all.  Either way, it's a  case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just  who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[15:50:57] GORANI:  So Seth Fiegerman has been following this from New  York.  So I don't have an Alexa.  Exactly, how did this happen?  The  machine, the speaker misunderstood from the couple who command to sell this  -- sorry.  Send this audio file?</p><p>SETH FIEGERMAN, CNN SENIOR TECH REPORTER:  Well, the way Alexa works  generally is it picks up voice cues in order to provide you with the  information that you want.  In this case, Amazon is saying that it  overheard parts of a conversation and mishear words like Alexa to turn it  on, send a message to start cueing up a message.  And even the name of a  contact to send that message to.  It's a reminder that these products are  always listening to you.  But the intention after providing you a certain  convenience and yet, they're not perfect and might mishear things and  ultimately cause you a great inconvenience.</p><p>GORANI:  But it seems like telling Alexa to turn itself on to then, you  know, produce a clip of a conversation and send it to a contacts, so that  should be a very complex set of command.  The fact that all of these  commands were misunderstood in a single operation by the speaker, I don't  understand how that can happen.</p><p>FIEGERMAN:  I think a lot of people are puzzling over themselves right now.   I do think it's fair to say it's a fluke.  We've got to hear of another  example of that in the years since this product has been introduced.   Amazon calls is an extremely unlikely occurrence.  But it does raise  concerns that these things can't perfectly hear what you're saying.  You  forget that they're there.  They blend into the background and ultimately  you might accidentally trigger and inconvenient and scary occurrence.</p><p>GORANI:  Well, they're lucky that it was only a conversation about hardwood  floors right?</p><p>FIEGERMAN:  Agreed.</p><p>GORANI:  Not something else.  Seth, thanks very much for joining us.  Seth  Fiegerman.</p><p>More to come including rivers of fire beneath the ocean in Hawaii as the  eruptions continue.  We are live in Hawaii, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GORANI:  Well, the Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has continued to spew lava.   You can see here the active fissures bubbling up at the surface of the big  island.  Now, streams of lava are entering the Pacific Ocean near a power  plant.  So it could be an issue.  But so far though thankfully that plant  is not endangered.  Scott McLean who is right next to some of that lava  flow joins me now live.</p><p>What's going on where you are, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, Hala.  So people on this section of  the big island, they seemed to be playing this volcanic game of Whac-A- Mole, just when you think that things are dying down in one area, they  suddenly spring up.  And another case and point this giant fissure that you  see behind me, it's the one that we've been watching for a couple of days  now and it has shrunk substantially.  That said, there is another one that  sprung to seemingly take its place and it is pumping lava into a place that  really does not needed.  A neighborhood called Leilani Estates, a  subdivision not far from here that has been terrorized by lava since  Kilauea first woke up.  And there are also fears that we are just getting  actually in the last couple of hours, an official warnings from authorities  that another lava flow could cross a major highway in this area which would  cut off our routes, the place where I'm standing right now.  We'd have to  find an alternate route.  It also means that people in that area, on the  North side of that highway are starting to pack up and it is proving just  how unpredictable Kilauea can be.</p><p>[15:55:01] GORANI:  And so, what is -- I mean, it appears as though this  volcano is not lighting up that this is going to be a reality for that part  of Hawaii for the foreseeable future.</p><p>MCLEAN:  It seems that way.  The experts will tell you that they don't know  or at least they don't seem to know exactly at this point how long this  will last.  They can use sort of other eruptions in the past as a  historical, you know, marker.  But at the end of the day, this volcano is  going to erupt for as long as it does and they can't exactly pin down when  this will be over, when people will be able to go home.</p><p>GORANI:  And what about residents?  I can only imagine that at this point,  they must be quite fed up.</p><p>MCLEAN:  Yes.  I think -- you talked to a lot of people who may be thought  that they were OK a couple of weeks ago, thought that things were going to  be just fine and now all of a sudden, they are sort of packing up as a  precaution, especially now with this word that things have crossed -- or  maybe crossing the highway.</p><p>Quickly, Hala, I also spoke to a gentleman who had two homes, that he has  fully expected would get swallowed up by the lava, but a man Darryl Clinton  actually protected them.  He is the guy who got hit by a lava bomb.  I  caught up with the homeowner of those homes that he was protecting  yesterday.  Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE HILL, HAWAII RESIDENT:  We approached this, I think the way you're  supposed to.  We spoke to out Hawaiian friends in Kalapana.  And, you know,  you clean house for them.  You prepare and then you -- you're not in  charge.  And I think that Darryl and Lisa, Mark no doubt about us and we  left with a humble hope that we would be able to be back and I think  nature's wanted to help, wanted to facilitate in any way that they could,  you know.  It's hard when your friend gets hurt.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCLEAN:  So, Hala, just to hammer home how extraordinary this is, the man  you heard there, he fully expected that when he left, he took all of his  furniture with them.  He thought that his two homes on that property would  be gone.  The only reason that they are there today is because of that man  named Darryl Clinton, the only person, so far, to have been injured by  Kilauea.</p><p>GORANI:  incredible.  Scott McLean, thanks very much for joining us, live  from Hawaii.</p><p>Check out Facebook page, facebook.com/halagoranicnn for more.  I'm Hala  Gorani.  Thanks for watching tonight.  If it's your weekend, have a great  weekend.  If not, have a great Saturday and Sunday.

Oil prices dropped after Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived. I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>Good evening. It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual acts. It has been seven months since women began coming forward with accusations against him. Seven months that have rocked the media industry and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.</p><p>The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning point. Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein's attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"</p><p>CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court. Brynn you've been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?</p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people, really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.</p><p>He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months. One of those women, we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.</p><p>Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond. He also had to surrender his passport. He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for 24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be back in court on these charges in July.</p><p>Right now, like I said, he left court. We are not quite sure exactly where he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.</p><p>SY: All right, Brynn. Thanks for laying that out for us. Now, from hotel room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.</p><p>The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry. Then came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more equality in workplaces everywhere.</p><p>Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul. New York Attorney General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women accused him of assault.</p><p>From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them was journalist, Lauren Sivan. She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her at a restaurant. The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST: I was terrified when it first happened. It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly. I just wanted you know, to go along living my life. I wanted to pretend it never happened, and hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: It was a story we heard repeated over and over again. Now, Sivan is hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of industries. She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIVAN: For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going on for three decades and enough is enough.</p><p>SY: Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these incidents happened without mutual consent. Do you ever think you'll see a day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?</p><p>SIVAN: I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he is found--</p><p>[16:05:16]</p><p>SIVAN: -- guilty by a jury. I think that the numbers speak for themselves. There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way. I mean, hearing these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.</p><p>You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science. I mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and 20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that that had happened to someone else before. I knew it in my heart and so when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I came out to validate them. He belongs in jail.</p><p>SY: Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of you. It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.</p><p>SIVAN: Absolutely. Abuse of power can be found anywhere. You don't have to be a rich Hollywood mogul. In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor. They all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.</p><p>Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and respected within their communities. I think it's a lesson to all of us that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen to victims. We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.</p><p>SY: And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward. What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?</p><p>SIVAN: Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental. When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found guilty.</p><p>And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well. We have to give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.</p><p>It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall Street now. It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow closed off about 58 points there. Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil prices are falling.</p><p>After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the near future. That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US sanctions are returning to Iran. His words helped send oil prices falling down to $76.00 a barrel. It was our emerging market's editor, John Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister. He sent us this report from the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: Even after crude prices surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the market to bring prices lower.</p><p>However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in St. Petersburg. It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of BP, Total and Shell. There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.</p><p>Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.</p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA: We will do the right thing. We will make sure that markets are well supplied. We will make sure that consumers'--</p><p>[16:10:16]</p><p>AL-FALIH: -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait until June to make that announcement</p><p>DEFTERIOS: At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take 1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic crisis. Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in the implementation of US sanctions.</p><p>But it's not all about a drop in production. The big producers are hearing the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so that prices are not tweaked very significantly.</p><p>So, I think it's a very good development.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit demand for crude at the same time.</p><p>John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.</p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>SY: High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets. A government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.</p><p>A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of emergency in fact on Friday. Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.</p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Exactly, and as you mentioned, this strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.</p><p>So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of gas, and others, you see long lines. There have been altercations spiked. It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to the airports. It is also affecting livestock. There are trade groups saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds to the chickens.</p><p>Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions. That they would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it down. In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to lower the price 10 percent. This had a negative impact on Petrobras. They don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.</p><p>But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike. The problem is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads. The drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long time, Stephanie.</p><p>SY: They want to see it enshrined in law. Meanwhile, a really tough stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if necessary. Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what would happen if that did.</p><p>DARLINGTON: Absolutely, Stephanie. What we are waiting for now is the public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway. So, you can imagine how the dire the situation is.</p><p>SY: And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single Brazilian state. You talked a little bit about the impact and the paralysis when it comes to transporting goods. What impact could this have on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?</p><p>DARLINGTON: It's already having an impact. I mean, a lot of those -- those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but it isn't. Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry. They are not even being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.</p><p>So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy. It is having a huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential elections in October--</p><p>[16:15:16]</p><p>DARLINGTON: -- so people are taking a very cautious stance. Do they get behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down. Do they stand behind the very unpopular government. It is making it even more difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.</p><p>SY: All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.

Now, the US President is suggesting the summit could be revived. Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time. Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out having the summit on June 12th after all.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to see what happens. We are talking to them now. It was a very nice statement they put out. Let's see what happens. We'll see what happens, it could even be the 12th. We are talking to them now. They very much want to do it, we'd like to do it. We are going to see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries in the world. We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's announcement. This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew this story was unlike any other. Eighteen trips to North Korea and this country still keeps me guessing. For more than 24 hours, we didn't even know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen. The rhetoric with the US was really heating up.</p><p>Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go. We rode for more than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train. It was surreal. A 10-course banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.</p><p>We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site. Arriving at Punggye-ri was surreal. The buildings were log cabins, almost like a summer camp. It was definitely not what I expected.</p><p>We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines to get to observation posts built specifically for us. We visited tunnel after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear tests since 2006. All of them full of explosives. Football sized bags strung with wires.</p><p>We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--</p><p>[16:20:16]</p><p>RIPLEY: -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would be blown up just hours later. The explosions were huge, earth-shaking, they sent rocks and debris flying. We found some of it scattered later hundreds of feet away. I can only imagine what it felt like during those nuclear tests.</p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North Koreans claimed. For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.</p><p>Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting for.

There are certain things you simply can't do with data anymore that give a profit.</p><p>BURKE: The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.</p><p>According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this requirement.</p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD: On your Facebook profile, you can put in things like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents, to deliver your advertising and so on.</p><p>BURKE: There is only an \"I accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly.</p><p>BURKE: There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.</p><p>VEALE: Exactly, you've got it.</p><p>BURKE: Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other websites, too.</p><p>VEALE: Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that also send data to Facebook.</p><p>BURKE: As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making these inferences that they make about us?</p><p>VEALE: Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without explicit consent.</p><p>BURKE: Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook, European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global annual revenue. Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.</p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete their information.\" The company also says, it is building a new tool that will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it collects from other websites and apps.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: We do expect to be fully compliant on May 25th.</p><p>BURKE: Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica have engaged in.</p><p>SCHREMS: If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in this digitalized age.

Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day that GDPR goes into effect.</p><p>You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take down their own websites. I read that that is affecting 500 million users today. Was this expected?</p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE: Well, I think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into effect. I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet and have practices that operate over the internet. And GDPR is very stringent and sweeping.</p><p>SY: So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with this law. It really has teeth, doesn't it?</p><p>GHOSH: Absolutely, yes. As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced. There is no record. There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens. Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to establish that they are processing data lawfully.</p><p>So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.</p><p>SY: So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is going to comply with the spirit of the law?</p><p>GHOSH: Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.</p><p>I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.</p><p>And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as far as I can see. Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to do exactly this thing.</p><p>SY: Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights. Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\" Dipayan, do you think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.</p><p>GHOSH: Well, I think it's a little bit of both. You're absolutely spot on in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several years. I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years, let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT Act. These are all very partisan issues.</p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident. So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue. Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.</p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.

Eight women told us they were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as inappropriate behavior.</p><p>Freeman has issued an apology. Now he is facing fallout from some brands affiliated with the actor. Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now. Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted your investigation. Talk about that.</p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER: Yes, well, first of all, it's been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a year ago.</p><p>The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p>Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked.</p><p>SY: Wow --</p><p>MELAS: I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade --</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>MELAS: And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen. There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the line. And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose not to cover the film. But in those next few days, I started making some phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where we share the stories of 16 people.</p><p>SY: Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior, right?</p><p>MELAS: And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about --</p><p>SY: Sure --</p><p>MELAS: It's about giving a platform. My transparency and telling my small part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets. At his productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters, \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including Janet Mock who is a well-known activist.</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>MELAS: And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we are rigorously vetting those.</p><p>SY: And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p>MELAS: Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to my supervisor and just reported it. A lot of the women that we were speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful of their jobs for speaking out about --</p><p>SY: Oh, yes --</p><p>MELAS: The most powerful person at the production company or the movie set. It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\". People were very nervous --</p><p>SY: Yes --</p><p>MELAS: And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16. It just goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so afraid to speak out against the powerful --</p><p>SY: And frankly, some don't want the attention too. So what's been the fallout --</p><p>MELAS: Yes --</p><p>SY: For Meghan Freeman so far?</p><p>MELAS: So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish. It was a few hours after that he released an apology. Now VISA has suspended their marketing campaign with him. The transit system in Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause.</p><p>And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him. In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p>SY: Are you satisfied with the apology?</p><p>MELAS: I don't think that it comes down to that. I think it just is what it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent.</p><p>So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep you posted.</p><p>SY: I know you will. Chloe Melas, thank you so much.</p><p>MELAS: Thanks.</p><p>SY: Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts. Ben Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY: Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual. He has vehemently denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.</p><p>Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were reported to the police at the time. These events occurred and I anticipate that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far.</p><p>That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now. Caroline, thanks for being here. A lot of people believe this is a turning point and most importantly illegal inflection points.</p><p>CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: That's right, and I wrote a piece for Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye.</p><p>My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has. It's a huge victory for the legal system. You have to look at it in the context of, you know, how charges are interpreting rules.</p><p>And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me Too movement. There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing happened to them as well.</p><p>So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect, which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me.</p><p>SY: From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like Brafman said though. I mean, it's the question of whether you can really get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum --</p><p>POLISI: Right --</p><p>SY: By the movement --</p><p>POLISI: Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at this point, that Brafman is probably right. Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there.</p><p>However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn against his sexual assault --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein. I mean, that's not going to fly in this movement --</p><p>SY: That certainly is as --</p><p>POLISI: Yes --</p><p>SY: Saying everyone does it.</p><p>POLISI: Yes --</p><p>SY: And that being a legal strategy --</p><p>POLISI: Right --</p><p>SY: But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis. What are the challenges prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges.</p><p>POLISI: Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going to go after these women hard. We know that there are two specific allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape. Look, when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always, you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence.</p><p>Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said, she said. Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after money, they're after the fame.</p><p>The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up claims --</p><p>SY: And there are --</p><p>POLISI: Sure --</p><p>SY: So many --</p><p>POLISI: Yes --</p><p>SY: Women --</p><p>POLISI: There are so many --</p><p>SY: In this case --</p><p>POLISI: When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case --</p><p>SY: And cross in jurisdiction --</p><p>POLISI: Yes --</p><p>SY: As well -- he's under investigation in many places --</p><p>POLISI: Yes --</p><p>SY: Including overseas and Europe.

He warns that more and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III. He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just the start.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK: What concerns me more on the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not only cold, but World War III.</p><p>So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the case filed ten years ago. And this is very unfortunate, and on the other hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which is also not good.</p><p>Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important enough to the United States. But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it. So, I think the sooner we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p>I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back --</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: There's a discussion about the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions and Syria for example as well.</p><p>What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want to take it anymore.</p><p>KOSTIN: Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity of Russian companies to a big extent. Like VTB restrictions of you borrowing on your stocks. But the latest sanctions against the companies like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the company.</p><p>And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be unemployed. You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies. So definitely, that's what I call as the red line.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S. sanctions. Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p>KOSTIN: My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the main reason why I'm on the list. You know, because I was quite -- I was spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but should do more business.</p><p>But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries. You know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue to support the American banks here and our relationship. But I was just -- as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake, they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company.</p><p>[16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I mean as business as usual.</p><p>Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be back.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia, diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011. A lot of words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up.</p><p>KOSTIN: I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes. But part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress. For example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p>And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of the economic growth. I will give you one of the problems for Russia at least or for the workforce. We have very low unemployment, but we don't have enough new workforce to develop the economy.</p><p>So that's the area where the Russians are to think. Maybe to relax immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia. And also yes, I agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries, particularly with the export potential.</p><p>That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SY: It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge. The latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy.</p><p>SY: As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S. has yet to see the same sort of protection. And in the state of Oregon, an Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private conversation without her knowledge. Anna Stewart brings us the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a cautionary tale of technology telling too much. A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion. Like immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again. I can't trust it.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who works for her husband. She only found out about the recording when she received an alarming phone call.</p><p>[16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The person on the other line said, unplug your devices right now. We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART: Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence. It's unknown if the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out when it was activated or if the device responded at all.</p><p>By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SY: But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story. They finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs. And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy stocks.</p><p>The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil in the near future. Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday.</p><p>It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for stocks. London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on the back of renewed political uncertainty. Italy has a new government this week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence.</p><p>European banks were among the worst performers. And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018052501cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SDK-J891-JB20-G446-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 25, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009STT</classCode><className>UNITED CO RUSAL LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>ORGANIZATION OF THE PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p> Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p> The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p> CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p> He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p> Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p> Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p> SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p> The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p> Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p> From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p> SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p> SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p> [16:05:16]  </p><p> SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p> You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p> SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p> SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p> Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p> SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p> SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p> And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p> It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p> After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p> However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p> Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p> [16:10:16]  </p><p> AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p> But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p> So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p> John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p> A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p> SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p> So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p> Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p> But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p> SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p> SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p> So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p> [16:15:16]  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p> SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p> And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p> This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p> Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p> We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p> We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p> We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p> [16:20:16]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p> It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p> Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p> Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p> GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p> MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p> BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p> SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p> BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p> According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p> MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p> BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p> BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p> BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p> VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p> BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p> VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p> In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p> BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p> SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p> BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p> You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p> DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p> SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p> GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p> So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p> SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p> GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p> I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p> And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p> SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p> GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p> It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p> It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  </p><p> And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p> SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p> GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p> SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p> And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.  First, these are the top  headlines on Cnn this hour.  One day after canceling his scheduled summit  with North Korea's leader, U.S. President Donald Trump is suggesting the  summit could be revived. </p><p> Earlier, North Korea declared that Kim Jong-un is still willing to meet  with Mr. Trump at any time.  Mr. Trump called that statement quote, \"very  good news.\"  Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is out on bail after  appearing in a court on charges of rape and sex abuse. </p><p> The charges stem from two separate incidents and involves two women.   Weinstein's attorney says his client will enter a plea of not guilty and  expects to be exonerated.  Polls are about to close across Ireland as the  country votes on whether to legalize some of strictest abortion laws in  Europe. </p><p> The referendum will decide whether to keep a constitutional amendment that  bans abortion in almost all cases.  Voting ends in the next 30 minutes, the  first exit polls are expected not long after.  In Canada, police hope  surveillance photos will help them find two men who detonated and  improvised explosive device that happened in a restaurant near Toronto. </p><p> Fifteen people were injured, two of them critically.  Police say there is  no indication of a motive so far.  The Duchess of Sussex better known as  Meghan Markle now has her own coat of arms.  The duchess works closely with  the College of Arms to design it.</p><p> The queen approved the design which includes personal touches like golden  poppies from California which is Meghan's home state.  </p><p> [16:35:00] A Cnn investigation has uncovered a pattern(ph) of alleged  inappropriate behavior by legendary actor Morgan Freeman both on set and at  his production company Revelations Entertainment.  Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p> Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p> CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p> The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p> Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p> SY:  Wow -- </p><p> MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p> SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p> MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p> SY:  Sure -- </p><p> MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p> SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p> MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p> SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p> SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p> MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p> MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p> And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p> SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p> MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p> So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p> SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p> MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p> SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.  Ben  Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> [16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY:  Mr. Weinstein has always maintained  that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.  He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p> Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p> That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p> CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p> My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p> And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p> So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p> SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right -- </p><p> SY:  By the movement -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p> However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p> SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right -- </p><p> SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p> POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p> Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p> The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p> SY:  And there are -- </p><p> POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p> SY:  So many -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Women -- </p><p> POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p> SY:  In this case --</p><p> POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p> SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p> POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p> SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p> The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p> So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p> Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p> I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p> What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p> KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p> And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p> KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p> But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p> [16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p> Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p> KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p> And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p> So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p> That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p> STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p> [16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p> STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p> By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p> The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p> It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on  Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p>Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p>The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p>CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p>He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p>Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p>Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p>SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p>The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p>Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p>From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p>SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p>SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p>You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p>SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p>SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p>Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p>SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p>SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p>And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p>It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p>After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p>However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p>Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p>But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p>So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p>John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p>A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p>So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p>Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p>But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p>SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p>So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p>And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p>This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p>Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p>We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p>We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p>We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p>Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p>Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p>GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p>MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p>According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p>VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p>You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p>SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p>So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p>SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p>I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p>And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p>SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p>GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p>SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p>And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.  First, these are the top  headlines on Cnn this hour.  One day after canceling his scheduled summit  with North Korea's leader, U.S. President Donald Trump is suggesting the  summit could be revived. </p><p>Earlier, North Korea declared that Kim Jong-un is still willing to meet  with Mr. Trump at any time.  Mr. Trump called that statement quote, \"very  good news.\"  Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is out on bail after  appearing in a court on charges of rape and sex abuse. </p><p>The charges stem from two separate incidents and involves two women.   Weinstein's attorney says his client will enter a plea of not guilty and  expects to be exonerated.  Polls are about to close across Ireland as the  country votes on whether to legalize some of strictest abortion laws in  Europe. </p><p>The referendum will decide whether to keep a constitutional amendment that  bans abortion in almost all cases.  Voting ends in the next 30 minutes, the  first exit polls are expected not long after.  In Canada, police hope  surveillance photos will help them find two men who detonated and  improvised explosive device that happened in a restaurant near Toronto. </p><p>Fifteen people were injured, two of them critically.  Police say there is  no indication of a motive so far.  The Duchess of Sussex better known as  Meghan Markle now has her own coat of arms.  The duchess works closely with  the College of Arms to design it.</p><p>The queen approved the design which includes personal touches like golden  poppies from California which is Meghan's home state.  </p><p>[16:35:00] A Cnn investigation has uncovered a pattern(ph) of alleged  inappropriate behavior by legendary actor Morgan Freeman both on set and at  his production company Revelations Entertainment.  Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p>Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p>The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p>Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p>SY:  Wow -- </p><p>MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p>SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p>MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p>SY:  Sure -- </p><p>MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p>SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p>MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p>SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p>SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p>MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p>And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p>SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p>MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p>So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p>SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p>MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p>SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.  Ben  Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY:  Mr. Weinstein has always maintained  that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.  He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p>Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p>That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p>CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p>My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p>And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p>So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p>SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  By the movement -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p>However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p>SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p>POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p>Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p>The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p>SY:  And there are -- </p><p>POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p>SY:  So many -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Women -- </p><p>POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p>SY:  In this case --</p><p>POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p>SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p>POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p>SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p>The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p>So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p>Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p>I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p>What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p>And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p>KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p>But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p>[16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p>Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p>KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p>And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p>So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p>That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p>STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p>[16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p>By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p>The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p>It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on  Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p>Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p>The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p>CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p>He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p>Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p>Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p>SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p>The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p>Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p>From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p>SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p>SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p>You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p>SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p>SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p>Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p>SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p>SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p>And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p>It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p>After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p>However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p>Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p>But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p>So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p>John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p>A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p>So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p>Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p>But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p>SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p>So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p>And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p>This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p>Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p>We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p>We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p>We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p>Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p>Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p>GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p>MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p>According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p>VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p>You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p>SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p>So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p>SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p>I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p>And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p>SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p>GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p>SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p>And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.

Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p>Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p>The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p>Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p>SY:  Wow -- </p><p>MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p>SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p>MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p>SY:  Sure -- </p><p>MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p>SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p>MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p>SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p>SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p>MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p>And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p>SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p>MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p>So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p>SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p>MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p>SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.  Ben  Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY:  Mr. Weinstein has always maintained  that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.  He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p>Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p>That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p>CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p>My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p>And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p>So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p>SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  By the movement -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p>However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p>SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p>POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p>Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p>The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p>SY:  And there are -- </p><p>POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p>SY:  So many -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Women -- </p><p>POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p>SY:  In this case --</p><p>POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p>SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p>POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p>SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p>The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p>So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p>Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p>I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p>What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p>And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p>KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p>But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p>[16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p>Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p>KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p>And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p>So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p>That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p>STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p>[16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p>By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p>The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p>It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on  Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p> Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p> The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p> CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p> BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p> He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p> Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p> Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p> SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p> The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p> Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p> From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p> SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p> SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p> [16:05:16]  </p><p> SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p> You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p> SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p> SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p> Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p> SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p> SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p> And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p> It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p> After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p> However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p> Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p> KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p> [16:10:16]  </p><p> AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p> But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p> So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p> John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p> A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p> SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p> So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p> Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p> But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p> SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p> SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p> So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p> [16:15:16]  </p><p> DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p> SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p> And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p> This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p> Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p> We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p> We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p> We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p> [16:20:16]  </p><p> RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p> It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p> Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p> Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p> GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p> SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p> MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p> BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p> SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p> BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p> According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p> MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p> BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p> BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p> VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p> BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p> VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p> BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p> VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p> BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p> In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p> MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p> BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p> SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p> [16:25:16]  </p><p> SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p> BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p> (END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p> SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p> You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p> DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p> SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p> GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p> So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p> SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p> GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p> I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p> And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p> SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p> GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p> It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p> It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p> [16:30:16]  </p><p> And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p> SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p> GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p> SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p> And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.  First, these are the top  headlines on Cnn this hour.  One day after canceling his scheduled summit  with North Korea's leader, U.S. President Donald Trump is suggesting the  summit could be revived. </p><p> Earlier, North Korea declared that Kim Jong-un is still willing to meet  with Mr. Trump at any time.  Mr. Trump called that statement quote, \"very  good news.\"  Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is out on bail after  appearing in a court on charges of rape and sex abuse. </p><p> The charges stem from two separate incidents and involves two women.   Weinstein's attorney says his client will enter a plea of not guilty and  expects to be exonerated.  Polls are about to close across Ireland as the  country votes on whether to legalize some of strictest abortion laws in  Europe. </p><p> The referendum will decide whether to keep a constitutional amendment that  bans abortion in almost all cases.  Voting ends in the next 30 minutes, the  first exit polls are expected not long after.  In Canada, police hope  surveillance photos will help them find two men who detonated and  improvised explosive device that happened in a restaurant near Toronto. </p><p> Fifteen people were injured, two of them critically.  Police say there is  no indication of a motive so far.  The Duchess of Sussex better known as  Meghan Markle now has her own coat of arms.  The duchess works closely with  the College of Arms to design it.</p><p> The queen approved the design which includes personal touches like golden  poppies from California which is Meghan's home state.  </p><p> [16:35:00] A Cnn investigation has uncovered a pattern(ph) of alleged  inappropriate behavior by legendary actor Morgan Freeman both on set and at  his production company Revelations Entertainment.  Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p> Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p> CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p> The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p> Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p> SY:  Wow -- </p><p> MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p> SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p> MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p> SY:  Sure -- </p><p> MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p> SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p> MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p> SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p> SY:  Yes -- </p><p> MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p> SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p> MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p> MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p> And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p> SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p> MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p> So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p> SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p> MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p> SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.  Ben  Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> [16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY:  Mr. Weinstein has always maintained  that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.  He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p> Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p> That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p> CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p> My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p> And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p> So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p> SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right -- </p><p> SY:  By the movement -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p> However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p> SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p> POLISI:  Right -- </p><p> SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p> POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p> Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p> The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p> SY:  And there are -- </p><p> POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p> SY:  So many -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Women -- </p><p> POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p> SY:  In this case --</p><p> POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p> SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p> POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p> SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p> POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p> SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p> [16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p> The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p> So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p> Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p> I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p> JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p> What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p> KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p> And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p> KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p> But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p> [16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p> Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p> DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p> KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p> And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p> So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p> That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p> STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p> [16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p> STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p> By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p> The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p> It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on  Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn. </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p>Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p>The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p>CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p>He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p>Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p>Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p>SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p>The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p>Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p>From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p>SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p>SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p>You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p>SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p>SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p>Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p>SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p>SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p>And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p>It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p>After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p>However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p>Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p>But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p>So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p>John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p>A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p>So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p>Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p>But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p>SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p>So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p>And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p>This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p>Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p>We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p>We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p>We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p>Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p>Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p>GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p>MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p>According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p>VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p>You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p>SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p>So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p>SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p>I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p>And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p>SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p>GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p>SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p>And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.  First, these are the top  headlines on Cnn this hour.  One day after canceling his scheduled summit  with North Korea's leader, U.S. President Donald Trump is suggesting the  summit could be revived. </p><p>Earlier, North Korea declared that Kim Jong-un is still willing to meet  with Mr. Trump at any time.  Mr. Trump called that statement quote, \"very  good news.\"  Disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein is out on bail after  appearing in a court on charges of rape and sex abuse. </p><p>The charges stem from two separate incidents and involves two women.   Weinstein's attorney says his client will enter a plea of not guilty and  expects to be exonerated.  Polls are about to close across Ireland as the  country votes on whether to legalize some of strictest abortion laws in  Europe. </p><p>The referendum will decide whether to keep a constitutional amendment that  bans abortion in almost all cases.  Voting ends in the next 30 minutes, the  first exit polls are expected not long after.  In Canada, police hope  surveillance photos will help them find two men who detonated and  improvised explosive device that happened in a restaurant near Toronto. </p><p>Fifteen people were injured, two of them critically.

The duchess works closely with  the College of Arms to design it.</p><p>The queen approved the design which includes personal touches like golden  poppies from California which is Meghan's home state.  </p><p>[16:35:00] A Cnn investigation has uncovered a pattern(ph) of alleged  inappropriate behavior by legendary actor Morgan Freeman both on set and at  his production company Revelations Entertainment.  Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p>Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p>The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p>Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p>SY:  Wow -- </p><p>MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p>SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p>MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p>SY:  Sure -- </p><p>MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p>SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p>MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p>SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p>SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p>MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p>And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p>SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p>MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p>So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p>SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p>MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p>SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.  Ben  Brafman says he believes the Me Too movement could compromise the case. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>[16:40:00] BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, ATTORNEY:  Mr. Weinstein has always maintained  that any sexual activity he engaged in was consensual.  He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p>Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p>That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p>CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p>My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p>And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p>So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p>SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  By the movement -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p>However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p>SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p>POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p>Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p>The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p>SY:  And there are -- </p><p>POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p>SY:  So many -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Women -- </p><p>POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p>SY:  In this case --</p><p>POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p>SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p>POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p>SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p>The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p>So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p>Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p>I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p>What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p>And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p>KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p>But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p>[16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p>Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p>KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p>And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p>So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p>That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p>STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p>[16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p>By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p>The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p>It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.

Oil prices dropped after  Saudi comments with our John Defterios, we will hear them on this program.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four little letters, years of preparation and millions of annoying e- mail, GDPR has officially arrived.  I am Stephanie Sy, this is \"Quest Means  Business.\"  </p><p>Good evening.  It all began with Harvey Weinstein, and tonight the  disgraced media mogul is facing charges of rape and other criminal sexual  acts.  It has been seven months since women began coming forward with  accusations against him.  Seven months that have rocked the media industry  and sparked a cultural transformation in corporate America.  </p><p>The founder of the #MeToo Movement says, today's events are a turning  point.  Let's begin with the charges against Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein's  attorney says his client will plead \"not guilty.\"  </p><p>CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the New York Criminal Court.  Brynn you've  been covering these events throughout the day, take us through the day and  where is Harvey Weinstein this evening?  </p><p>BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, Stephanie, really, everything that  happened today was well orchestrated and preorganized by the three people,  really groups involved -- the Manhattan DA's Office, the NYPD and then  Harvey Weinstein and his attorneys -- that goes from his turning himself  early this morning, just after 7:00 to then coming here to court and facing  a judge immediately, and already, when he was in front of that judge, he  knew pretty much what his bail package was going to be.  </p><p>He was charged with all of those charges that you've laid out, the most  serious of them being rape and those come from two separate women who made  complaints with the NYPD over the past seven months.  One of those women,  we actually know about, that's because her story was revealed in that  explosive \"New Yorker\" article, Lucia Evans who says that she was forced to  give Weinstein oral sex in his office here in Lower Manhattan back in 2004.  </p><p>Now, his bail package, he was released on $1 million cash bond.  He also  had to surrender his passport.  He has to wear a GPS monitoring system for  24/7 and he can only stay in New York or Connecticut and he is going to be  back in court on these charges in July.  </p><p>Right now, like I said, he left court.  We are not quite sure exactly where  he went, but we do believe he is at home in Connecticut.  </p><p>SY:  All right, Brynn.  Thanks for laying that out for us.  Now, from hotel  room assaults to boardroom firings to courtroom charges, Harvey Weinstein  early attempts to dismiss the allegations against him failed.  </p><p>The #MeToo Movement campaigning against sexual assault quickly picked up  the cause and pushed it to the top of the agenda for every industry.  Then  came the Time Is Up Campaign pushing for an end to harassment and more  equality in workplaces everywhere.  </p><p>Even a man who was prosecuting Weinstein fell foul.  New York Attorney  General, Eric Schneiderman was forced from office after multiple women  accused him of assault.  </p><p>From the start, the #MeToo Movement was about the victims and one of them  was journalist, Lauren Sivan.  She says, Weinstein sexually assaulted her  at a restaurant.  The Weinstein's fame made it hard to speak up.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>LAUREN SIVAN, AMERICAN JOURNALIST:  I was terrified when it first happened.   It didn't want anyone to know about this publicly.  I just wanted you know,  to go along living my life.  I wanted to pretend it never happened, and  hopefully never see him again, because Harvey Weinstein wielded so much  power, I am not even an actress in Hollywood, but I thought one phone call  from Harvey Weinstein, I could have lost my job, I could have been  prevented from getting hired somewhere else, if he wanted to do that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  It was a story we heard repeated over and over again.  Now, Sivan is  hosting a documentary series focusing on abusive power across all kinds of  industries.  She told me how elated she was about today's charges and what  it may mean for Weinstein's accusers.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SIVAN:  For all of those women that I have gotten to know, we are really  rejoicing today because we saw this coming and we had hoped and prayed that  we could find charges that would stick because this behavior had been going  on for three decades and enough is enough.  </p><p>SY:  Now, of course, Harvey Weinstein's lawyer says he doesn't believe  these charges will stick and Mr. Weinstein continues to deny that these  incidents happened without mutual consent.  Do you ever think you'll see a  day when Harvey Weinstein admits to any wrongdoing?  </p><p>SIVAN:  I don't know if he'll admit to any wrongdoing, but I still hope he  is found--  </p><p>[16:05:16]  </p><p>SIVAN:  -- guilty by a jury.  I think that the numbers speak for  themselves.  There is no way that 90 women come out of the woodwork with  the same similar story and it was fabricated in any way.  I mean, hearing  these stories over the last eight months, there's no other conclusion to  come to, except this man was a monster who preyed on young and vulnerable  women in Hollywood who looked to him for opportunity.  </p><p>You know, he knew what he was doing and he had it down to a science.  I  mean, the fact that I met him on a random occasion and within an hour and  20 minutes, he exposed himself to me, tells me that \"I am not alone\" that  that had happened to someone else before.  I knew it in my heart and so  when his story first came about, when Ashley Judd and Rose McGowen bravely  told their story, I knew that they were telling truth, and that's why I  came out to validate them.  He belongs in jail.  </p><p>SY:  Lauren, I will never forget when you first told your story, how  haunting it was to hear you describe how he told you to just stand there  and be quiet while he exposed himself and pleasured himself in front of  you.  It was so awful, but then so many more stories came out, and you now  host a show called, \"Abuse of Power\" on the Oxygen Network, clearly, this  has gone way beyond Hollywood and touched really every industry.  </p><p>SIVAN:  Absolutely.  Abuse of power can be found anywhere.  You don't have  to be a rich Hollywood mogul.  In fact, on the show which airs on Oxygen on  Saturdays, you can see different accounts of abuse of power from a local  sheriff to a well-respected lawyer, to you know, a praised doctor.  They  all abuse their power to really disastrous ends.  </p><p>Even committing crimes to cover up those transgressions and people don't  believe the victims because these men are so highly praised and revered and  respected within their communities.  I think it's a lesson to all of us  that no matter how small or young the victim's voice is, we have to listen  to victims.  We have to believe victims unless we are proven otherwise.  </p><p>SY:  And a lot of these cases especially with men of the stature that  Harvey Weinstein had, there is no criminal charges that ever come forward.   What does it represent that we are now seeing Harvey Weinstein, criminally  charged with these acts, what does it mean for the broader movement?  </p><p>SIVAN:  Oh, I think this is a huge day, and I mean, change is incremental.   When I saw that Cosby verdict, I knew that something had turned, that  something had changed, a tide had turned because all of a sudden, his  defense of victim shaming, of blaming those victims and trying to discredit  them on the stand backfired on Cosby's defense team and he was found  guilty.  </p><p>And here, I see hope for Harvey Weinstein's victims as well.  We have to  give Lucia Evans our utmost respect and gratitude for going forward with a  criminal complaint because that is not easy to do.  </p><p>It's much easier to come to the press and tell your story in a way that you  want to tell it, but to go through the criminal process, you know, it's not  easy and so, she has my utter respect and gratitude.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  We'll go back to that story later in the show, but let's turn to Wall  Street now.  It was a rocky session ahead of a long weekend and the Dow  closed off about 58 points there.  Shares in Exxon and Chevron saw the  biggest losses, as the entire energy sector fell and that is because oil  prices are falling.  </p><p>After comments made to CNN's John Defterios, Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister  told him that OPEC and Russia could supply more oil to world markets in the  near future.  That comes as Venezuelan output has collapsed and US  sanctions are returning to Iran.  His words helped send oil prices falling  down to $76.00 a barrel.  It was our emerging market's editor, John  Defterios who spoke to the Saudi Oil Minister.  He sent us this report from  the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  Even after crude prices  surged recently to $80.00 a barrel, the major oil producers of the world  were reluctant to address the issue of putting more crude back on to the  market to bring prices lower.  </p><p>However, we seemed to have a breakthrough after a panel I chaired here in  St. Petersburg.  It included the major oil producers and also the CEO's of  BP, Total and Shell.  There seems to be alignment between Saudi Arabia and  Russia to put about a million barrels a day back on to the market.  </p><p>Here is the Minister of Petroleum for Saudi Arabia.  </p><p>KHALID AL-FALIH, MINISTER OF ENERGY FOR SAUDI ARABIA:  We will do the right  thing.  We will make sure that markets are well supplied.  We will make  sure that consumers'--  </p><p>[16:10:16]  </p><p>AL-FALIH:  -- anxiety are addressed, and that at the end of the day, it's a  balanced market with consumers that are comfortable that will drive it  forward, whether it is a million more or less, I think we will have to wait  until June to make that announcement  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the end of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers decided to take  1.8 million barrels a day off the market to eat up a big surplus, but that  was worsened by the drop in production in Venezuela due to its economic  crisis.  Now, they have to wait also, perhaps Iran's production dropping in  the implementation of US sanctions.  </p><p>But it's not all about a drop in production.  The big producers are hearing  the complaints by two big consumers, particularly the United States with  President Trump suggesting that prices are artificially high and India  suggesting that $80.00 oil pinches their economy.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Well, I think it's a very important thing that we must  increase supply to ensure that the demand and supply matches each other so  that prices are not tweaked very significantly.  </p><p>So, I think it's a very good development.  </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  At the same time, Russia and Saudi Arabia don't want to be  blamed for higher gas prices for consumers, which could eventually hit  demand for crude at the same time.  </p><p>John Defterios, CNNMoney, St. Petersburg.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  High oil prices have already taken their toll in some markets.  A  government source says, Brazilian President, Michel Temer has authorized  his military to clear blockades on roads across the country.  </p><p>A trucker strike now in its fifth day is bringing South America's largest  economy to a grinding halt, Sao Paolo was forced to declare a state of  emergency in fact on Friday.  Shasta Darlington is there in Sao Paolo and  Shasta, this did all start with rising fuel prices there.  </p><p>SHASTA DARLINGTON, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Exactly, and as you mentioned, this  strike has actually been going on all week, it's blocked major highways  across the country and this has halted the delivery of central goods from  food to the supermarkets to fuel to the petrol stations.  </p><p>So, here in Sao Paolo, a lot of petrol stations have already ran out of  gas, and others, you see long lines.  There have been altercations spiked.   It has also affected airports in the capital city of Brazilia, a number of  flights have had to be cancelled because they just can't get the fuel to  the airports.  It is also affecting livestock.  There are trade groups  saying that up to a billion chickens could die because they can't the feeds  to the chickens.  </p><p>Now, this is going on even though last night, the government came out  saying they had reached an agreement with the truckers unions.  That they  would eliminate some taxes on the price of diesel, which would bring it  down.  In the meantime, the state-run oil company, Petrobras agreed to  lower the price 10 percent.  This had a negative impact on Petrobras.  They  don't like to see a lot of government intervention in price setting here.  </p><p>But in theory, it was supposed to bring an end to the strike.  The problem  is we woke up this morning and the trucks were still on the roads.  The  drivers said they weren't going anywhere until those taxes -- the  elimination of the taxes was approved by Congress so that it was real, so  that they could feel it and taste it and of course, that could take a long  time, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  They want to see it enshrined in law.  Meanwhile, a really tough  stance, we're hearing from President Temer who says he will dispatch  national forces essentially, the army to break up this blockade if  necessary.  Any word, Shasta on when we expect that might happen and what  would happen if that did.  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  Absolutely, Stephanie.  What we are waiting for now is the  public decree, the official decree, and then the word is that they will  send out the army into the roads around the refineries, clear up the access  so they can get that fuel in and out, also to key power plants, especially  in the north where they haven't been able to get fuel in to keep those  running, and of course to airports, hospitals and places that really need  these essential supplies, here in Sao Paolo, that's also an issue because  it's such a big city, these things need to happen quickly and we are moving  into a weekend when a lot of deliveries aren't made anyway.  So, you can  imagine how the dire the situation is.  </p><p>SY:  And I understand these blockades are happening in almost every single  Brazilian state.  You talked a little bit about the impact and the  paralysis when it comes to transporting goods.  What impact could this have  on sectors of the Brazilian economy that depend on exports?  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  It's already having an impact.  I mean, a lot of those --  those one billion chickens that I mentioned, I mean, it sounds comic, but  it isn't.  Brazil is the biggest exporter of poultry.  They are not even  being able to feed them, let alone get them to the port for export.  </p><p>So, this really is just slowing down the whole economy.  It is having a  huge impact at a time when everyone is gearing up for a big presidential  elections in October--  </p><p>[16:15:16]  </p><p>DARLINGTON:  -- so people are taking a very cautious stance.  Do they get  behind the truckers and say, yes, diesel prices need to come down.  Do they  stand behind the very unpopular government.  It is making it even more  difficult to come up with a solution, Stephanie.  </p><p>SY:  All right, a real developing crisis there in Brazil.  Shasta  Darlington, thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>GDPR is now live.  So far, this four little letters have caused a blackout  for some US websites.  We will speak to a former policy adviser at  Facebook.  </p><p>And Donald Trump says, he could meet Kim Jong-un after all.  We will take  you inside North Korea.  </p><p>This time yesterday, markets had dropped after Donald Trump's decision to  cancel his meeting with Kim Jong-un.  Now, the US President is suggesting  the summit could be revived.  Earlier on Friday, North Korea said Kim Jong- un is still willing to meet at any time.  Now, Mr. Trump isn't ruling out  having the summit on June 12th after all.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We are going to see what  happens.  We are talking to them now.  It was a very nice statement they  put out.  Let's see what happens.  We'll see what happens, it could even be  the 12th.  We are talking to them now.  They very much want to do it, we'd  like to do it.  We are going to see what happens.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  During this pivotal moment, CNN's Will Ripley is one of the only  Western journalist inside North Korea, one of the most repressive countries  in the world.  We've got a front row seat to both Pyongyang's apparent  demolition of nuclear sites, and their reaction to Donald Trump's  announcement.  This is his behind the scenes report from North Korea.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  From the moment I landed in Wonsan, I knew  this story was unlike any other.  Eighteen trips to North Korea and this  country still keeps me guessing.  For more than 24 hours, we didn't even  know if our trip to the Punggye-ri nuclear site would happen.  The rhetoric  with the US was really heating up.  </p><p>Only when we boarded the bus did we know, it was a go.  We rode for more  than 12 hours on a North Korean luxury train.  It was surreal.  A 10-course  banquet with all the blinds closed and strict orders not to film outside.  </p><p>We also couldn't film on the drive to the nuclear site.  Arriving at  Punggye-ri was surreal.  The buildings were log cabins, almost like a  summer camp.  It was definitely not what I expected.  </p><p>We had to carry our gear and hike for what felt like ages of steep ravines  to get to observation posts built specifically for us.  We visited tunnel  after tunnel, the same tunnels North Korea has used to conduct six nuclear  tests since 2006.  All of them full of explosives.  Football sized bags  strung with wires.  </p><p>We even had lunch provided by the North Koreans--  </p><p>[16:20:16]  </p><p>RIPLEY:  -- ham and cucumber sandwiches, surrounded by buildings that would  be blown up just hours later.  The explosions were huge, earth-shaking,  they sent rocks and debris flying.  We found some of it scattered later  hundreds of feet away.  I can only imagine what it felt like during those  nuclear tests.  </p><p>It was totally impossible to verify if what we were seeing if all of those  dramatic explosions actually made the nuclear site unusable as the North  Koreans claimed.  For the nuclear officials on site, there was almost a  sense of sadness, watching more than a decade of hard work go up in smoke.  </p><p>Will Ripley, CNN, at the Punggye-ri nuclear test site, North Korea.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  So, this is the day European data privacy activists have been waiting  for.  The EU's General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR came into force,  but got off to a rocky start.  A slew of US websites like the LA Times,  NPR, and Chicago Tribune took their own websites down in Europe.  </p><p>Beyond that, the flood of e-mails jamming your inbox continues.  Businesses  are asking for consent to store your data.  It is required by the new law.   Earlier this week, Europe's data protection chief told Richard on this  program, all of those e-mails aren't even useful.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN HOST:  We are all being bombarded with privacy papers  and privacy policies, most of which we don't even read.  Tell me, sir, how  is this useful?  </p><p>GIOVANNI BUTTARELLI, EUROPEAN DATA PROTECTION SUPERVISOR:  It is not.  What  is missing is the human phase of what they are doing.  It is time to start  respecting people and privacy and not the companies themselves.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SY:  Now, not only are some websites going dark, billion dollar law suits  are flying, too.  Samuel Burke has the story from London.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Austrian lawyer, Max Schrems has been  fighting Facebook in court over data privacy for nearly a decade, and  today, he wasted little time, his NGO suing Facebook for allegedly  violating the EU's new data protection law called GDPR, the day it came  into force.  </p><p>MAX SCHREMS, AUSTRIAN LAWYER:  They were looking for big companies that  really willfully violate the law that kind of tried to ignore it and tried  to get away with it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Schrems who helped write the regulations said he is taking legal  action because big tech isn't complying with the law.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  Various (inaudible) this idea of we don't want this, we think  it's stupid, so we don't want to comply with it, and then there's obvious  business interest.  There are certain things you simply can't do with data  anymore that give a profit.  </p><p>BURKE:  The new law was supposed to stop companies from hoovering up your  sensitive data like political opinions, religious beliefs, ethnicity and  sexuality for advertising purposes without your consent.  </p><p>According to legal experts CNN spoke with, Facebook is skirting this  requirement.  </p><p>MICHAEL VEALE, EPSRC PHD:  On your Facebook profile, you can put in things  like sexuality, religion or political beliefs, and if you put that on, you  don't have any choice but for Facebook to use it to personalize contents,  to deliver your advertising and so on.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is only an \"I accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly.  </p><p>BURKE:  There is not an \"I don't accept\" button.  </p><p>VEALE:  Exactly, you've got it.  </p><p>BURKE:  Veale says even if you completely remove sensitive traits from your  profile, Facebook can still glean information such as your sexual  orientation by analyzing your behavior on the platform and on other  websites, too.  </p><p>VEALE:  Facebook can infer things from the great amount of data that it has  about you across the web and also across your mobile devices and apps that  also send data to Facebook.  </p><p>BURKE:  As you understand the law, does it prevent Facebook from making  these inferences that they make about us?  </p><p>VEALE:  Yes, that law forbids Facebook from making these inferences without  explicit consent.  </p><p>BURKE:  Failure to comply could be costly for a big company like Facebook,  European data regulators can impose a fine of up to 4 percent of its global  annual revenue.  Based on 2017 figures, that means Facebook could face a  penalty topping $1.6 billion each time it runs afoul of the new law.  </p><p>In a statement to CNN, Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer said the company  has \"introduced better tools for people to access, download and delete  their information.\"  The company also says, it is building a new tool that  will allow users to stop Facebook from storing information about them it  collects from other websites and apps.  </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We do expect to be fully compliant on May  25th.  </p><p>BURKE:  Lawyer Max Schrems believes the new rules are tough enough to  prevent the kind of data scraping that companies like Cambridge Analytica  have engaged in.  </p><p>SCHREMS:  If we enforce them properly, we can actually get a balance in  this digitalized age.  In the end--  </p><p>[16:25:16]  </p><p>SCHREMS:  -- you as a customer have the possibility to use let's say  Facebook without worrying 24/7 about your data.  </p><p>BURKE:  However the courts come down on the tech giants, Europe's new data  regulations are already redrawing the line between profit and privacy.   Samuel Burke, CNN, London.  </p><p>(END VIDEO TAPE)  </p><p>SY:  Dipayan Ghosh was a technology adviser to the Obama White House and  has also served as an adviser on privacy to Facebook and he joins us now  from Seattle.  Dipayan, it's a pleasure to have you with us on this day  that GDPR goes into effect.  </p><p>You know, I am really surprised that so many US publishers decided to take  down their own websites.  I read that that is affecting 500 million users  today.  Was this expected?  </p><p>DIPAYAN GHOSH, FORMER TECHNOLOGY ADVISER TO THE OBAMA WHITE HOUSE:  Well, I  think that it was always expected for some major companies to not be in  compliance with GDPR and to the fullest extent on the day that it goes into  effect.  I mean, there are so many companies that operate over the internet  and have practices that operate over the internet.  And GDPR is very  stringent and sweeping.  </p><p>SY:  So, it's almost like they are saying, we would rather take our content  down than risk the fines and this is how difficult it is to comply with  this law.  It really has teeth, doesn't it?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Absolutely, yes.  As I said, it's stringent and it is sweeping and  businesses do not know how it is going to be enforced.  There is no record.   There is no precedence and the requirements include an entirely new consent  framework, new rights afforded to individuals, European citizens.   Lawfulness of processing of data in the sense that businesses need to  establish that they are processing data lawfully.  </p><p>So, very broad set of new requirements that GDPR is imposing and I am not  surprised at all, but maybe even dozens of companies are having to change  their operations overnight or come offline until they can comply.  </p><p>SY:  So, within hours of the law going into effect, Dipayan, complaints  filed against Facebook, Google, Instagram -- a lot of others, as a former  policy adviser at Facebook, Dipayan, are you confident that that company  which has been at the center of many of the data usage controversies is  going to comply with the spirit of the law?  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, the spirit of the law is of course to give the individual  greater rights, give the individual a sense of privacy and autonomy from  the corporation, from Facebook, from Google, from the Bank of America, and  I think that is a really new challenge for many American companies.  </p><p>I do think Facebook is taking a number of steps in the right direction and  let's be honest, Facebook is not the only company that collects tremendous  amounts of data and monetizes it in different ways over the internet.  </p><p>And I think that they are all taking steps, steps in the right direction as  far as I can see.  Now, I think it will be an ongoing challenge and a very  difficult challenge for companies like Facebook and Google and others to  continue to comply with GDPR, this is why they are hiring a lot of staff to  do exactly this thing.  </p><p>SY:  Yes, you tweeted today, I hope you don't mind me mining your Twitter  feed, \"Americans have to stand up and call for better privacy rights.   Else, we will be treated as lesser citizens on the net.\"  Dipayan, do you  think Americans have a higher tolerance for how their data is manipulated  or is there just a lack of politic will in this country to do more in the  ways of regulation that we are seeing in Europe.  </p><p>GHOSH:  Well, I think it's a little bit of both.  You're absolutely spot on  in your analysis, but diving into the second of those a little bit, there  is tremendous political gridlock on privacy issues going back several  years.  I mean, a number of privacy proposals to establish baseline privacy  law in the United States have been pushed forward in the past five years,  let's say, the Obama administration, the White House issued its Consumer  Privacy Bill of Rights Act in 2015, and in recent months, we have seen more  bills including the Data Broker Transparency Act as well as the CONSENT  Act.  These are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon, and that is an issue.  Americans do need  to stand up because public sentiment -- these are all very partisan issues.  </p><p>It's typically Democrats behind this issue, and now, it takes on a heavier  political slant with the whole Cambridge Analytica and Facebook incident.   So, I don't think we are going to necessarily see any progress on the  legislative front any time soon.  </p><p>[16:30:16]  </p><p>And that is an issue, the political slant with the whole Cambridge  Analytica and Facebook incident.  So I don't think we're necessarily going  to see any progress on the legislative front any time soon, and that is an  issue.</p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>GHOSH:  Americans do need to stand up because public sentiment can overcome  political gridlock over time.</p><p>SY:  And certainly, a lot of people thought the Zuckerberg testimony before  Congress, should it -- Congress doesn't have a full grasp of the technical  issues behind data.  Dapayan Ghosh, we'll leave it there, thank you so much  for your insights, appreciate it. </p><p>GHOSH:  Thank you so much. </p><p>SY:  Up next, in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein charges, another  Hollywood figure is also facing allegations from several women -- more  details when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Hello, I'm Stephanie Sy, coming up on the next half hour of QUEST  MEANS BUSINESS, one of the Russians sanctioned by the United States says  more and more people are thinking about World War III, you're hear from  VTB's Andrey Kostin. </p><p>And a major brands are re-thinking their ties with Morgan Freeman after a  Cnn exclusive investigation into his conduct.

Eight women told us they  were victims of what some call harassment and others describe as  inappropriate behavior. </p><p>Freeman has issued an apology.  Now he is facing fallout from some brands  affiliated with the actor.  Chloe Melas who broke this story joins me now.   Chloe, it's good to have you here, and it's interesting to me what prompted  your investigation.  Talk about that. </p><p>CHLOE MELAS, CNN ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER:  Yes, well, first of all, it's  been a month-long investigation with my co-reporter and firm, and what  prompted it all like you said is I had my own experience with Morgan  Freeman, it took place at a junket for the movie \"Going in Style\" over a  year ago. </p><p>The junket was in New York, they're permanently held, you know, in hotel  rooms, a room full of people, cameras rolling, I walked in there and from  the moment I walked in the room, he began making such like suggestive  comments to me, one of which was caught on tape and which he says, boy, do  I wish I was there while looking me up and down.</p><p>Very similar comments to what he said when I first walked in the room, I  was six months pregnant at the time, I was shocked. </p><p>SY:  Wow -- </p><p>MELAS:  I mean, I've been doing this for over a decade -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And I really had never experienced behavior that was so brazen.   There's a difference between being flirty and then there's crossing the  line.  And you know, I reported the behavior to my supervisors, we chose  not to cover the film.  But in those next few days, I started making some  phone calls and now here we are a year later and we have this report where  we share the stories of 16 people. </p><p>SY:  Yes, I mean, it's so hard when you sort of become the story, but  clearly, it prompted something in your mind, you ended up interviewing  eight women who alleged sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior,  right? </p><p>MELAS:  And you know, it's about giving other people a voice, it's about -- </p><p>SY:  Sure -- </p><p>MELAS:  It's about giving a platform.  My transparency and telling my small  part of what happened is just a sidebar to this larger systemic issue that  we had found, which is a pattern of behavior on movie sets.  At his  productions company Revelations Entertainment, at junkets with reporters,  \"Entertainment Tonight\" released their own footage last night showing  Morgan Freeman talking inappropriately to two \"Fair\" reporters including  Janet Mock who is a well-known activist. </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And then Anne Sung(ph) and I have received numerous people coming  forward with their own stories in the last 24 hours since it broke, and we  are rigorously vetting those. </p><p>SY:  And so many of these women when it comes the situation, they can't go  to an HR department, I mean, that's not the situation you're in, they're  not necessarily journalists on Cnn.</p><p>MELAS:  Well, let me -- well, let me point out is that, I might be a  journalist at Cnn, but even my first thought was not to go to HR, I went to  my supervisor and just reported it.  A lot of the women that we were  speaking to and men who witnessed some of this behavior, they were fearful  of their jobs for speaking out about -- </p><p>SY:  Oh, yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  The most powerful person at the production company or the movie  set.  It's Morgan Freeman, it's the voice of \"God\".  People were very  nervous -- </p><p>SY:  Yes -- </p><p>MELAS:  And our story is very telling with only one woman we're willing to  reveal her identity, two, if you include myself out of the 16.  It just  goes to show you that this wave of the Me Too movement, people are so  afraid to speak out against the powerful -- </p><p>SY:  And frankly, some don't want the attention too.  So what's been the  fallout -- </p><p>MELAS:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  For Meghan Freeman so far? </p><p>MELAS:  So he did not issue a statement at all before we went to publish.   It was a few hours after that he released an apology.  Now VISA has  suspended their marketing campaign with him.  The transit system in  Vancouver that had just recently announced that they were going to be using  his voice for announcement and for campaigns, they have put that on pause. </p><p>And the SAG Awards, they just issued a lifetime achievement award to him.   In January, had said that they are reviewing the situation right now.</p><p>SY:  Are you satisfied with the apology? </p><p>MELAS:  I don't think that it comes down to that.  I think it just is what  it is and different stars have been covering this movement for many months  now with many different powerful men in the industry, and some people deny  some people apologizing some, like Kevin Spacey are radio silent. </p><p>So I think it just is what it is, but we will monitor the fallout and keep  you posted.</p><p>SY:  I know you will.  Chloe Melas, thank you so much. </p><p>MELAS:  Thanks. </p><p>SY:  Harvey Weinstein's attorney lashed out at the Me Too movement moments  after his client was charged with rape and criminal sexual acts.

He has vehemently  denied any of the allegations which suggest that he engaged in non- consensual sexual activity.  </p><p>Many of these allegations are long overdue, quite frankly, having been made  about events that are alleged to have occurred many years ago, they were  reported to the police at the time.  These events occurred and I anticipate  that the women who have made these allegations when subjected to cross- examination in the event we even get that far. </p><p>That the charges will not be believed by 12 people, assuming we get 12 fair  people who are not consumed by the movement that seems to have overtaken  this case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  Caroline Polisi says Weinstein arrest is a turning point for the Me  Too movement, she is a federal criminal defense attorney and joins me now.   Caroline, thanks for being here.  A lot of people believe this is a turning  point and most importantly illegal inflection points. </p><p>CAROLINE POLISI, DEFENSE ATTORNEY:  That's right, and I wrote a piece for  Cnn opinion about this very issue because look, in the wake of the Harvey  Weinstein's scandal about a year and a half ago, of course, we saw a lot of  lip service being rendered in social media and sort of in the public eye. </p><p>My question was whether or not it would infiltrate the court system and  really meaningful ways, and today, we seem that it really has.  It's a huge  victory for the legal system.  You have to look at it in the context of,  you know, how charges are interpreting rules. </p><p>And I think that if you look at the Bill Cosby, the second trial of Bill  Cosby which took place -- the re-trial of course took place after the Me  Too movement.  There, we're seeing a more -- judges more willing to take in  other acts evidence or other witnesses that say that this type of thing  happened to them as well.</p><p>So, looking down the road in terms of any sort of criminal trial for Harvey  Weinstein, I think he's got to be worried about the Bill Cosby effect,  which is there are going to be victims lined up outside the door to testify  against Harvey Weinstein saying he did the exact same thing to me. </p><p>SY:  From that point of view, the effect of the Me Too movement is like  Brafman said though.  I mean, it's the question of whether you can really  get a jury that has not been impacted by the momentum -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  By the movement -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right, and I think we're seeing such a saturation in the media at  this point, that Brafman is probably right.  Now, I don't know if that's a  good thing or a bad thing.  I mean, look, coming from the standpoint of a  criminal defense attorney, obviously, you want a jury of unbiased people to  decide whether or not the incident that is alleged on that specific evening  or the night in question actually took place and not to sort of convict  somebody just because you know, there are rumors and speculation out there. </p><p>However, I really do think that Ben Brafman -- and he's an amazing criminal  defense attorney, he obviously, he represented Dominique Strauss-Kahn  against his sexual assault -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>Yes, successfully, he's kind of playing by the old playbook though, and the  comments that he made today, you know, stating that the casting couch  wasn't invented by Harvey Weinstein.  I mean, that's not going to fly in  this movement -- </p><p>SY:  That certainly is as -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Saying everyone does it.</p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  And that being a legal strategy -- </p><p>POLISI:  Right -- </p><p>SY:  But he also said hinting at the legal strategy, bad behavior is not on  trial, which leads to my from a legal analysis.  What are the challenges  prosecutors will have in substantiating these specific charges. </p><p>POLISI:  Well, you heard Brafman say there specifically, that they're going  to go after these women hard.  We know that there are two specific  allegations, one in 2014 and one thereafter, and one is actual rape.  Look,  when you have criminal charges dating so far back in time, there's always,  you know, the challenge of not having physical evidence. </p><p>Likely, there's not going to be DNA evidence, so it's going to be, he said,  she said.  Now, this is the type of thing that in the past, defense  attorneys go after these women really hard, and we saw them do it in the  Bill Cosby trial, just go after their credibility, say they're only after  money, they're after the fame. </p><p>The fact is though, we as a society have realized that, women don't make up  claims -- </p><p>SY:  And there are -- </p><p>POLISI:  Sure -- </p><p>SY:  So many -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Women -- </p><p>POLISI:  There are so many -- </p><p>SY:  In this case --</p><p>POLISI:  When you look, I think there's over 80 women in Harvey's case -- </p><p>SY:  And cross in jurisdiction -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  As well -- he's under investigation in many places -- </p><p>POLISI:  Yes -- </p><p>SY:  Including overseas and Europe.  Caroline Polisi, we will have to leave  it there, thank you so much for your insights. </p><p>POLISI:  Thank you. </p><p>SY:  Russian businesses and the people who run them are feeling the  pressure from American sanctions.  One of those sanctioned tells us more,  and more people are worried about relations between the two countries. </p><p>[16:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska is stepping down from his aluminum  company Rusal.  His departure comes a day after the resignation of Rusal's  chief executive and seven board members.  The world's second largest  aluminum producer has been under intense pressure following U.S.-imposed  sanctions. </p><p>The chairman of VTB Bank is also under U.S. sanctions.  He warns that more  and more people in Russia are now thinking about a possible World War III.   He told our John Defterios that sanctions like those against Rusal are just  the start. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, PRESIDENT &amp; CHAIRMAN, VTB BANK:  What concerns me more on  the sanction, that's you know, if for the first time in many years on this  case(ph), people in Russia started to believe in the possibility of not  only cold, but World War III. </p><p>So people now definitely has concern about the security, which was not the  case filed ten years ago.  And this is very unfortunate, and on the other  hand, we see the growing anti-American sentiment in Russian society which  is also not good. </p><p>Because frankly speaking, Russia always was very friendly and important  enough to the United States.  But this climate(ph) today of sanctions and  mutual, you know, accusations, they don't help it.  So, I think the sooner  we stop it and start to reverse the process, the sooner, Mr. Putin meets  Mr. Trump and start some dialogue.</p><p>I think there'll be -- the process should start to go back -- </p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR:  There's a discussion about  the red lines being crossed with the aggressiveness of the sanctions for  what took place in the U.K. with the poisoning accusations of interventions  and Syria for example as well. </p><p>What snaps us? What's the breaking point for Russia? You said we don't want  to take it anymore. </p><p>KOSTIN:  Well, I think on previous sanctions, they restricted the activity  of Russian companies to a big extent.  Like VTB restrictions of you  borrowing on your stocks.  But the latest sanctions against the companies  like Rusal for example, they're aiming -- they're actually destroying the  company. </p><p>And it means that dozens of thousands of people who are employed will be  unemployed.  You know, and thus, effectively will kill the companies.  So  definitely, that's what I call as the red line. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  You're one of 17 top officials or CEOs targeted by the U.S.  sanctions.  Give us a real honest indication of what it means to try to  operate under these sanctions regime when you've been spotted and tagged.</p><p>KOSTIN:  My friend, they're saying that I was talking too much on American  television, to Cnn, to other \"Fox\" television and the \"Cnbc\", that was the  main reason why I'm on the list.  You know, because I was quite -- I was  spoken under my position and maybe, bankers shouldn't talk very much, but  should do more business. </p><p>But I sincerely want a good relationship between our two countries.  You  know, we are very constructive for work, always and has and still continue  to support the American banks here and our relationship.  But I was just --  as a senior government official, just completely wrong, it's a mistake,  they should correct it because I'm CEO of a commercial company. </p><p>[16:50:00] But you know, I probably haven't felt that(ph) yet, because  there's -- this is because the bank itself is not only -- not as the  sanctions, so it's business as usual, I'm trying to keep a low profile, not  to create any additional problem for the institutions, but otherwise, I  mean as business as usual. </p><p>Personally, unfortunately, I'm not allowed to come to America, now we  should -- I like America, but I hope that one day will come when I'll be  back. </p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Every year that I come to the St. Petersburg forum, President  Putin says we need to focus on domestic road, our new partners in Asia,  diversify, but Russia hasn't grown 4 percent since 2010, 2011.  A lot of  words and no real concrete action here to get that growth up. </p><p>KOSTIN:  I shouldn't say, maybe all part of the economic growth, yes.  But  part of the economic stability, I think there's quite a big progress.  For  example, this year, we expect the surplus budget, this year we have the  very low inflation between 3.5 percent.</p><p>And from this point of view, I think Russia is doing quite well on part of  the economic growth.  I will give you one of the problems for Russia at  least or for the workforce.  We have very low unemployment, but we don't  have enough new workforce to develop the economy. </p><p>So that's the area where the Russians are to think.  Maybe to relax  immigration law, to invite particularly more Russians living abroad and  Ukraine, and maybe other countries to come back to Russia.  And also yes, I  agree, well, probably more should be done in supporting the new industries,  particularly with the export potential. </p><p>That's something we should -- we should have happening quite slowly, that's  why this year, we don't expect the GDP growth more than 2 percent, we  should -- we should lower(ph) for Russia, I agree with you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SY:  It can play music, set timers, order pizza, but Amazon's Alexa has  also recorded and sent a conversation with the speaker's knowledge.  The  latest among increasing concerns over consumer privacy. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SY:  As the new data loss sweeps across Europe, consumer data in the U.S.  has yet to see the same sort of protection.  And in the state of Oregon, an  Amazon Echo user was shocked when her device recorded and shared a private  conversation without her knowledge.  Anna Stewart brings us the story. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  It's a cautionary tale of technology  telling too much.  A woman in Oregon said Amazon's Alexa recorded and  (INAUDIBLE) a random person with a private conversation that took place in  her house.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I felt invaded, like total privacy invasion.  Like  immediately, I'm like, I'm never plugging that device in again.  I can't  trust it. </p><p>STEWART:  Amazon Echo owner Danielle said she was chatting with her husband  about hard wood floors when the device sent an audio file to a man who  works for her husband.  She only found out about the recording when she  received an alarming phone call. </p><p>[16:55:00] UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The person on the other line said, unplug  your devices right now.  We go around and unplug them all, he proceeded to  tell my husband(ph) he had received audio files recordings from what was  going on in our house.</p><p>STEWART:  Amazon told Cnn affiliate \"KIRO 7\", the device misinterpreted  command like send message and the contact's name as part of the background  conversation and called it an extremely rare occurrence.  It's unknown if  the couple didn't hear Alexa's voice replies or see the speaker light-out  when it was activated or if the device responded at all. </p><p>By the way, it's a case of mixed signals that has a lot of consumers  thinking twice about just who or what they bring into the house. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SY:  But no impact on Amazon's shares in response to that story.  They  finished up around half a percent today, not far from their record highs.   And U.S. markets overall closed mostly lower, dragged down by energy  stocks. </p><p>The markets reacted negatively to a sharp drop in oil prices after Saudi  Arabia told Cnn's John Defterios that OPEC and Russia could pump more oil  in the near future.  Both the Dow and S&amp;P 500 ended in the red as there's  no trading on Monday for the Memorial Day holiday. </p><p>It's a bank holiday weekend in Europe as well where it was a mixed day for  stocks.  London and Frankfurt made small gains, Milan and Madrid fell on  the back of renewed political uncertainty.  Italy has a new government this  week, and Spain's Prime Minister could face a vote of no confidence. </p><p>European banks were among the worst performers.  And that is QUEST MEANS  BUSINESS tonight, I'm Stephanie Sy in New York, Richard will be back on  Monday, meanwhile, the news continues here on Cnn. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2018 Cable News Network, Inc.

The companies leading the charge have not only become an integral part of our lives but are also pervasive, stealthily influencing the choices we make. What to read, watch, eat, listen to - Big Tech is good at suggestions, it lures us into its ecosystem. </p><p>Now there are fears that Big Tech has grown too big for Big Governments. The US Department of Justice has, therefore, announced a broad antitrust investigation into its functioning. Even though the scope of the investigation will cover only the American landscape, the findings could give us a broader perspective on how technology is influencing our lives and how we are living by virtual terms set by them. Consider this: Google was formed in 1998; and Facebook in 2004. Today, Google performs nine out of every 10 online searches worldwide. And Facebook has connected well over two billion users and become the most popular social media network. The two firms together have taken over more than half the online advertising market. The questions we need to ask are these: Have these firms engaged in practices that have reduced competition? Has their growing dominance stifled innovation? And what has been the impact on us consumers, who have been happy with the low prices of products and convenience of using them but could be selling our lives to these companies. The Federal Trade Commission recently fined Facebook for $5 billion. The EU has fined Google for $1.7 billion for illegally using its dominant position for online search adverts. Facebook now plans to launch its digital currency, Libra, which could be the biggest disrupter in global finance. Governments and regulators have clearly not kept pace with the speed of innovation in the tech sphere but this investigation should lead to concrete measures that protect users. Checks and balances on big technology companies are essential. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation was a great start, and the US could take a leaf out of Europe's book. Technology is fine as long as humans govern it. Allowing Big Tech to determine the future of humankind would mean walking into a civilisational trap.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

Amazon together with Google, Twitter, Apple and Facebook form a rarefied club that offers massive digital platforms used by millions of apps, products and service providers. Facebook's active users are more than the combined population of Africa, Europe and Australia. These companies have developed enough financial and market muscle to earn the moniker Big Tech. The word monopoly is increasingly being used for Big Tech. They are now faced with existential questions as US lawmakers are turning up the heat on them. The call is for breaking up Big Tech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When is big too big? The answer lies outside Big Tech. Try looking for large consumer platforms that have emerged since the rise of Facebook and that have posed an enduring challenge to Big Tech. You will find none that straddle the length and breadth of the globe. During the senate hearing last year, Mark Zuckerberg struggled to name a direct competitor of Facebook. Evidently, Facebook's competition was either acquired by Facebook or was crushed by its dominant presence.</p><p>Does this mean that innovation is dead? This cannot be true if you see what the likes of Whatsapp and Instagram have achieved. But today they are part of Facebook. The not-so-lucky ones diminished because Big Tech produced their own copycat services that could easily be given more prominence on the platform. Harvard and Stanford studies suggest that Google Search allegedly gives priority to its own services. Amazon has launched several services that turned its partners using Amazon's cloud service into competitors.</p><p>Digital consumer platforms have become the lawless wild west where Big Tech is the sheriff and the perpetrator. The ecosystem players have sensed a conflict of interest, leading to a spate of lawsuits. Spotify filed a complaint with European Union about Apple. Spotify called out unfair practices of the App Store that is allegedly designed to prioritise Apple Music even though Apple charges 30 per cent subscription fee from Spotify. The digital value chain cannot thrive because all online advertising roads lead to Facebook and Google. Other digital services do not command the userbase to attract the amount of ad revenue enjoyed by Facebook and Google.</p><p>Big Tech has stymied potential products and services that could transform our lives. It's the opportunity cost of not having a competitive entrepreneurial environment where small and medium businesses grow into significant players. The consumers no longer decide what is of value. Big Tech does.</p><p>Venture capitalists find it hard to invest in startups because they are not sure if the newbies can face up to the formidable might of Big Tech. They do not believe that a David with shiny new ideas could trounce the digital world Goliaths because the odds are insurmountable. Aside from predatory capitalism, we are well aware of the social implications. These platforms can be easily used to influence elections and doctor public opinion as they use and abuse personal data of their consumers.</p><p>The industry was naive to assume that Big Tech will show a strong moral compass. Once the appetite for profiteering kept growing, the line between right and wrong got blurred. The industry was also clueless about how to regulate them. The confusion was partly because part of the consumer service offering is free. The US regulators were trying to apply the rules that regulated the railroads, telecom and computer industries, to regulate the digital industry. It was like bringing a tennis racket to a game of cricket. The lawmakers could not understand what to regulate because the implications of Big Tech on society and personal choices was not fully understood until last year when the Cambridge Analytica saga blew up in Facebook's face. Now hungry antitrust legal eagles are circling around, preparing for the kill.</p><p>The US regulators are not new to breaking up monopolistic companies. In the 1990s, Microsoft faced the risk of being split up when it lost an antitrust lawsuit, following which it agreed to open up to third party software for its Windows platform. Imagine if Google Search had been killed by Bing. The settlement allowed Google and Facebook to thrive. Microsoft's own software destiny unfolded because IBM was reined in.</p><p>Antitrust regulation is important to maintain balance of power within an industry so that entrepreneurship is protected. While a bipartisan view on the tech giants is still emerging in the US, the general consensus is that Big Tech should be broken up to separate marketplaces from their app services. Distribution networks should not ideally provide competing services on the same network.</p><p>The backlash will force them to at least sit at the table and agree to more disclosure of information like election ads and how apps are prioritised on apps stores. There will be more stringent regulation of user data and use-generated data. Outside of US, regulatory bodies should take a good hard look at how Big Tech is impacting local entrepreneurs. As the storm gathers over Big Tech, they will have to settle for a more level playing field.</p><p>Shalini Verma is the CEO of PIVOT technologies</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHATIM-140503063</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHATIM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNR-3RF1-F11P-X204-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338756</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"891\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Khaleej Times - Galadari Printing and Publishing Co.

The often-intense debates about these policies aren't just important because they could reshape the U.S. economy. They also reflect a larger, more fundamental disagreement about capitalism itself.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believe that the American system of extractive capitalism is fundamentally broken - Sanders to the point of identifying as a democratic socialist - and see its failure as one of the forces that carried President Donald Trump to the White House. Former vice president Joe Biden voices an opposing view: At an October fundraiser in Silicon Valley, he characterized Trump not as a product of American capitalism but rather a threat to it. \"You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this - you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work,\" he said. \"We've got to save capitalism from this guy.\"</p><p> Last week, as part of the Munk Debates series in Toronto, I had the opportunity to debate capitalism and the potential alternatives to it alongside Greek economist Yanis Varoufakis, former American Enterprise Institute president (and current Post contributor) Arthur C. Brooks and New York Times columnist David Brooks. I argued that the American system is broken in three ways.</p><p> First, it is fueling extreme inequality. Four decades of stagnant wages and upward flows of wealth in the United States have supercharged the existing wealth divide and other inequalities rooted in racial, gender and geographic differences. Productivity gains have flowed to the investor class, not to workers, and social mobility has declined. In his latest column (prepared for the debate), David Brooks countered that \"capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history.\" But Oxfam International highlights a more nuanced reality: While there has been a meaningful decline in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions more people could have been lifted out of poverty if not for extreme inequalities within and across countries.</p><p> Second, capitalism is undermining democracy. In the Citizens United era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors - and their business interests - than ever before. Corporate concentration is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society.</p><p> It doesn't take a socialist to see capitalism's corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on Monday to finally agree to disclose his campaign bundlers, used to recognize it earlier in the campaign, saying, \"There's tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.\"</p><p> And, third, capitalism is destroying nature. As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future. In pursuit of profits at any cost, corporations continue to ravage public lands, demolishing ecosystems, and poisoning the water we drink and the air we breathe. Meanwhile, even as corporate America has become more vocal about the importance of sustainability and the perils of climate change, it has opposed the dramatic policy changes needed to prevent catastrophe.</p><p> American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution. But tweaking around the economy's edges won't be enough. We need a deep, structural redesign of basic institutions and functions; we need a new system to better serve the common good.</p><p> In this system, there will continue to be individual freedoms, private enterprises and small businesses. But, unlike today, those businesses will be protected from monopoly power. There will be new models of corporate ownership and governance that protect workers' rights and increase their power. There will be limits on excessive consumption. And there will be a \"plutocracy prevention\" program - not to be punitive, but to ensure that billionaires pay more in taxes than teachers and nurses, and that we have the revenue needed to rebuild decaying infrastructure, combat climate change, reverse declining social mobility and more.</p><p> Brooks writes that one of capitalism's strengths is \"creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out.\" On that we agree. But I've learned over four decades of observing and writing about the economy that capitalism as we've known it doesn't work. Time is of the essence. For the sake of our economic, democratic and ecological survival, it's time for something better.</p><p> Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor and publisher of the Nation magazine, writes a weekly column for The Washington Post.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange on Dec. 5.

The bespectacled peer might make for an unlikely gunslinger, but when the chairman of Britain's Competition and Markets Authority stood up to address the Social Market Foundation in May 2019, there was a Wild West-style swagger in his step. Amid complaints about market abuse, Tyrie made no bones about his intention to take on giants like Facebook and Google. It was \"managing the challenges thrown up by the growth of the digital economy\" that he wanted to address. Appearing before MPs a few weeks later, he fired off a warning shot: \"Many people in this room are becoming vulnerable as a result of digital.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The subtext was clear: vengeance was coming - and he was the man to deliver it. Weeks later, the CMA launched a major investigation into online platforms and digital marketing. \"The work we do will open them up to greater scrutiny, and should give Parliament and the public a better grip on what [they] are doing,\" said Lord Tyrie.</p><p>Today, however, just days before the CMA's final report is due to be published, things feel different. For starters, the tough-talking lord is on the way out. This month, he said he would be stepping down from the role while pointing to the \"inherent limits\" of the post. What's more, recent investigations into Big Tech have fallen short. The CMA's probe into Google's takeover of analytics firm Looker was ultimately waved through and an investigation into Amazon's investment into Deliveroo all but collapsed. The latter \"was their flagship investigation for the year\", one source said. \"It came to nothing.\"</p><p>Industry observers say there are questions about whether the CMA's tough stance on Big Tech needs to change. Was Tyrie's approach too aggressive and unfocused? Perhaps.</p><p>\"They came in like a bull in a china shop and frankly made a bit of a meal of the Deliveroo situation,\" says Dominic Hallas, from the Coalition for a Digital Economy. \"It's important that the CMA takes the opportunity for a reset.\"</p><p>Right now, there is no time for a reset. The CMA's final report is due next week and will encompass everything from how Facebook and Google collect and use personal data, to how they glean ad revenue from newspaper content. It's been a long time coming.</p><p>By 2018, Google accounted for more than 90pc of all the UK revenues coming from search ads. Facebook soaked up half the \"display advertising\" revenue in the country.</p><p>Both firms claim they play a positive role in innovation. Yet, even so, the CMA is expected to put forward recommendations to curb their reach.</p><p>Early proposals included forcing the pair, called a \"duopoly\", to share data with rivals and breaking up Google's advertising engine. How likely those are to be implemented is unclear. After all, Google is a global company so a break-up would have to be conducted on a global scale. That is no mean task. Either way, there are things the CMA is likely to propose which would be easier to enforce: the idea of \"strategic market status\" being one, essentially preventing firms from being able to promote their own products over those of rivals. Another proposal is new rules to make Google and Facebook pay for media content - following a similar move in Australia. Some are sceptical whether such rules would work here. Last week, ministers were understood to still be looking at the possibility, although sources said they were unenthusiastic. More broadly, within Westminster, appetite to rein in Big Tech appears to be on the wane. Covid-19 has meant ties between tech firms and government have never been stronger.</p><p>This week will set the tone on whether appetite is also waning at the CMA, or whether it will seek further powers and propose broad market-changing remedies. \"There was a big idea at the CMA that digital markets were hugely problematic and we needed to do more,\" an insider says. Now, this idea looks less clear.</p><p>'They came in like a bull in a china shop and frankly made a bit of a meal of the Deliveroo situation'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-161102325</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607D-PCY1-JCBW-N13X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 28, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton will lead the effort.</p><p>In response to a Deseret News request for comment on the announcement, a Google spokesman referred to a statement published Friday on the company's blog page:</p><p>\"Google's services help people, create more choice, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the United States,\" wrote Kent Walker, Google senior vice president of global affairs. \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation: Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.</p><p>\"At the same time, it's of course right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law.\"</p><p>Monday's announcement continues the cascade of investigations currently focusing on big U.S. tech firms that also includes a separate effort launched Friday by a smaller group of state attorneys general that will focus on Facebook, as well as federal-level inquiries already underway by the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice. Congress has also been grilling representatives of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon in hearings exploring potential anticompetitive conduct. Collectively, the efforts have attracted support from elected officials on both sides of the aisle in a rare bridging of the current political divide.</p><p>Reyes told the Deseret News following the announcement that Google accounts for almost 90% of global search inquiries and that dominance is not in and of itself illegal or inherently anticompetitive. But he said that level of power could be leveraged in ways that would cause harm not only to consumers but even current and yet-to-be-conceived future tech companies.</p><p>\"When you're that big and that dominant and that pervasive, you have to be that much more careful about the actions you take,\" Reyes said. \"There is evidence that not only has Google not been hypercareful, but potentially very deliberate and purposeful about using their dominance to preclude others from being able to play in that space.\"</p><p>Reyes also noted his concerns about potential misuse of power by big tech companies goes back years and cited a 2016 letter he co-signed with D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine appealing to the Federal Trade Commission to investigate allegations that Google was manipulating search results to the detriment of competition. While the FTC took a pass on the request, officials from the European Union launched their own investigation which eventually led to the assessment of some $1.7 billion in fines against Google.</p><p>Reyes said lawyers and paralegal staff from his office, along with himself, will be participating in the investigative effort, which began Monday with a civil investigative command issued to Google. He expects the work to be accommodated under his current budget appropriation and said one of the advantages of so many participants in the effort is the ability to share costs and workload of what is likely to be a protracted process.</p><p>Reyes and over 40 other state attorneys general co-signed a letter in June outlining issues they share with how big tech firms operate, following a conference on antitrust issues in Omaha, Nebraska, in July. The 27-page document went to the FTC, which along with the Justice Department, is tasked with antitrust oversight in the U.S.</p><p>It noted that companies, like Google and Facebook, that give away their products, have created new challenges for enforcement and regulation under current statute.</p><p>\"Recent antitrust enforcement in technology markets has often failed to meaningfully evaluate non-price aspects of competition such as innovation, consumer choice and privacy,\" the letter reads. \"Recent comments by Makan Delrahim, antitrust chief at the United States Department of Justice, reaffirm the commitment of government antitrust enforcers to utilize current antitrust doctrine to address consumer harm in zero-price markets.\"</p><p>Google expects state prosecutors will ask it about past similar investigations in the U.S. and internationally, Walker wrote in his Friday blog post.</p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls so many aspects of the internet that it's hard to imagine surfing the web for long without running into at least one of its services.</p><p>Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes - because the alternative could be not reaching customers.</p><p>\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.</p><p>Critics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance. Europe's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March for unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, disadvantaging rivals in the online advertising business.</p><p>Another visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators have also investigated here - ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.</p><p>Google has long argued that although its businesses are large, they are useful and beneficial to consumers. But it appears regulators are growing more concerned not just with the effects on regular internet users, but on smaller companies as well.</p><p>\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'Well Google is dominant because they're good,' \" King said. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"</p><p>Jessica Melugin, associate director of nonprofit, libertarian think-tank Competitive Enterprise Institute, characterized the multistate Google investigation as \"high-profile activism\" and warned the investigation could have negative, downstream impacts on new tech business efforts.</p><p>\"These state attorneys general are expanding the power of their office and stretching the limits of what constitutes an antitrust violation,\" Malugin said in a statement. \"This sort of high-profile activism may benefit state A.G.s' political ambitions, but impose harmful costs on consumers, businesses and the economy.</p><p>\"The mere threat of legal penalties - and the environment of over-caution it engenders - also has a chilling effect on entrepreneurs. Such opportunity costs are impossible to measure.\"</p><p>Contributing: Associated Press</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-45843599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X16-9RB1-DY6J-M329-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Do we need regulation to deal with that? That is one of the big questions of the day.\"</p><p>PR or news media?</p><p>Asked \"who is more trusted? PR or news media?\" panelist Brian Lott, Head of Corporate Communications, Mubadala, said that despite the rise of fake news, he thought the public still believed in media more than PR, adding that communications had a big role to play in rebuilding trust.</p><p>\"Our challenge is to drive people to more authentic and truthful content,\" he said. \"People want truth\u2026they want reality, not unreality. And PR has always communicated that reality in an interesting and compelling way. With advertising being viewed more skeptically, we have an opportunity to take advantage of that.\"</p><p>Faisal J Abbas, Editor-in-Chief of Arab News, warned that new media platforms were undermining the legitimacy and reputation of traditional media.</p><p>\"My question from this region is, why is it you are tolerating terror propaganda on these outlets? The reality is children are being radicalised, they are being sent to fight in Syria,\" he said.</p><p>MUST READ: What is it like to step into a PR chief's shoes?</p><p>\"With the great reach and impact that social media has, there must be a great responsibility.\" But he warned that the role of censor or regulator should not be played by government, and that the platforms themselves should better police their content.</p><p>Valerie Tan, Vice President Public Relations, Social Media, Internal Communications, at Emirates, said media had much more to lose in the current debate.</p><p>\"People have always understood that PR and advertising has an agenda \u2026 now they realise that news outlets come with an agenda, too.\"</p><p>A moral obligation</p><p>Paul Holmes, Chair &amp; Founder, The Holmes Report, warned that the biggest danger came not from fake news itself but from attacks on legitimate news stories. \"There's a concerted effort to portray legitimate journalism as fake news,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a huge problem for the media and for us in PR, undermining the credibility of both.\" He added that PR practitioners have \"a moral obligation not to pollute those channels, social and mainstream, with our own fake news\".</p><p>Switching towards the PR industry's own reputation, John cited the demise of Bell Pottinger, the British PR firm that went into administration following a much cricticised and racially charged campaign in South Africa.</p><p>He asked whether PR firms had a moral choice to make over which clients they represent.</p><p>\"Many agencies were involved in so-called 'dark arts and spin' ... two phrases I hate,\" he said.</p><p>\"But in Bell Pottinger's case, their downfall came from within \u2013 they were expelled from the industry body PRCA for bringing the industry into disrepute.\"</p><p>Holmes said that Lord Bell, the former chairman of Bell Pottinger, had \"a view of PR being untenable in the modern world.\"</p><p>READ: Fake news: How advertisers and marketers should face it</p><p>He added: \"The divide between what is good PR and what is moral and ethical is, today, for the most part invisible. They are congruent in a way they never were 30 years ago. Ethics has to be at the heart of what we want to do. It's possible to do honorable work for bad companies. Equally it's possible to do dishonorable work for good companies.\"</p><p>Abbas, however, criticised the industry for \"being on the defensive\" over the allegations of 'spin'. \"We need to agree that perhaps most of the world looks at the PR industry as lobbyists,\" he said. \"You are hired on behalf of client, not the people, and you are paid to do a particular job, and they want value for money.\"</p><p>Tan said that PR was still struggling to shake off its negative reputation. \"PR has some way to go to convince we are not 'spin doctors'.</p><p>People know PR comes with an agenda, but it shouldn't be a negative, it's actually very helpful,\" she said. John added there was a responsibility for PR professionals and media to ensure a free and honest exchange of ideas.</p><p>Holmes insisted that the industry was not just about maximising profit but also about relationship building and emotional intelligence, something John agreed with, saying: \"Reputation is the most precious commodity in the world we live in today and as PR professionals, it's important we protect that for our clients and our brands.\"</p><p>Returning to media, and media literacy, the panellists agreed more needed to be done in educating the public on how to separate good news from bad, before Abbas wrapped up the session with a plea for the industry to not lose sight of values.</p><p>\"If you want the truth, read the media; if you want the exposure, work with bloggers and influencers.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GULF-110375916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GULF2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RPH-W411-F11P-X474-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"934\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 GMR-Online.com Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

That seems to be the question many are asking today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Where just a few years ago, companies like Facebook or Google were seen as white knights of progress, now there seems to be a lot more skepticism about their effects and their intentions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I saw this firsthand last week when I spoke at a conference on free speech and social media at Stanford Law School, where I talked about my new book, \"The Social Media Upheaval.\" As I discuss in my book, the rise of social media has brought about a lot of change, and much of it isn't appreciated.</p><p>In the book, I note that although our society generally supports free speech quite strongly, we do regulate speech that is too dangerous - like incitement to riot - or speech that is false and defamatory, and we often regulate things that are addictive, or invasions of privacy. Social media tends to have all of those characteristics to varying degrees. Some of that is because of how it is structured.</p><p>In the days of the old blogosphere, when people expressed views on their own personal blogs scattered across many different servers and platforms, other blogs might pick them up. But each time that happened, it took a conscious decision, and at least some degree of thought, to compose and publish a blog post, and bloggers who published links to stories or posts found elsewhere often encouraged readers to \"read the whole thing.\" On social media, a \"share\" or \"retweet\" takes but a second, and research indicates that most people never read anything but the headline before sharing. This facilitates the rapid spread of outrage mobs, conspiracy theories and hysteria.</p><p>Things are made worse by the fact that social media sites operate under algorithms that promote \"engagement,\" which generally means emotion. And because, as tech visionary Jaron Lanier has written, the easiest emotions to engage are the negative emotions, the effect of social media platforms' algorithms is to amplify negative feelings. The more you use them, the angrier and sadder you're likely to become.</p><p>At the same time, unlike the old blogosphere with its many independent platforms, social media sites have a common platform. Censoring the old blogosphere was impossible; censoring social media is possible, which means that social media companies face demands to do so.</p><p>The most popular solution on both the left and the right is using antitrust law to break them up. In a recent book on antitrust law, \"The Curse of Bigness,\" Columbia Law professor Tim Wu also argues for this response to Big Tech.</p><p>When President Teddy Roosevelt tackled behemoths like Standard Oil, he dealt with companies that became huge and rich in business, and then used their wealth to purchase political influence. Today's Big Tech has more power than that, because its monopolies stand astride political discourse: Companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter control the very channels through which people get their news and organize to act politically. That's more of a threat to democracy than anything John D. Rockefeller possessed.</p><p>As Wu writes: \"Big tech is ubiquitous, seems to know too much about us, and seems to have too much power over what we see, hear, do and even feel. It has reignited debates over who really rules, when the decisions of just a few people have great influence over everyone.\"</p><p>Judging by what I saw at Stanford last week, the debate is widening and more people are unhappy.

In fact, most of the conversation around technology in 2017 was about examining the problems and laying blame. Now the conversation has begun about repairing the damage and charting the best way forward.</p><p> One of the people leading that conversation is Andrew Keen. Keen is an author, and if you look at the titles of his previous books \u2014 The Cult of the Amateur, Digital Vertigo, and The Internet Is Not the Answer \u2014 you can tell he's been a tech naysayer since before it was cool. But he's singing a different tune with his new book, How to Fix the Future. Instead of diagnosing problems, Keen is proposing solutions, traveling the globe to educate himself and his readers on how governments, private enterprise, and individuals can build a kind of new \"digital social contract\" as the influence of technology in our lives inevitably grows.</p><p> Keen joins Mashable's MashTalk podcast to discuss those solutions, and the five tools he thinks are essential in creating them: competitive innovation, social responsibility, worker and consumer choice, education, and \u2014 yes \u2014 regulation. While many in Silicon Valley might bristle at any discussion of government stepping in on their turf, Keen sees regulation as an essential part of fixing things, although he also explains that it's not a panacea, and that it needs to be complemented with empowered consumers and innovative companies with new business models if it's going to help instead of hinder progress.</p><p> You can subscribe to MashTalk on iTunes  or Google Play , and we'd appreciate it if you could leave a review.

Futures are in the red by triple-digits 45 minutes ahead of Friday's opening bell.There is plenty to like about our current economic position, globally and historically. We're at half-century highs in the U.S. labor market. We saw 3.5% growth in Q3 GDP, on our way to the first full year of 3% growth in recent memory. </p><p>Although political plates are shifting in different regions around the world, we're not seeing more than a recognizable amount of global strife these days. The U.S.'s position leading the world from its economic meltdown a decade ago remains a shining beacon to the rest of the world's economies, to which we've rightly grown accustomed.BUT what's going to happen in our trade war in China? Will we descend further into pain on both sides of the Pacific or will we reach a new agreement of fairness that will benefit one or both of us? Debt \u2014 on both corporation and individual scales \u2014 is like a dark cloud looming on the horizon. Does this mean a hard rain is gonna fall (to appropriate Bob Dylan), and if so, how? And when, and by how much?The question marks regarding the midterm elections that consumed much of 2018 have dissipated, but to what end? Will Wall Street firms \u2014 banks, Big Tech, Big Pharma, et. al. \u2014 be expected to reign in current business behaviors by way of regulations and increased accountability, and will that somehow generate another down-leg for equities markets?So many questions. And often, whichever answer materializes may not be what investors consider optimum.Perhaps a shift in expectations is what's being asked of us currently. If so, it's important to recognize it's nothing we can't deal with; in fact, coming to terms with the headwinds we might be expected to face will help us avoid some of the worst problems that may otherwise develop. We had Goldilocks living in our house for a good year or more \u2014 perhaps it's time she moved on.Industrial Production for October reached 0.1% ahead of today's opening bell, lower than the 0.2% expected, which was also the downwardly revised total for September. Still positive, so that's something. October Capacity Utilization was better, reporting 78.4% which beat expectations by 20 basis points. September numbers were ratcheted up significantly to 78.5% \u2014 the highest we've seen in nearly three years. Score one for improved domestic productivity.Mark Vickery Senior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

But scrutiny of this intensity - and from regulators at that - doesn't sit too well with the likes of Facebook and Google, who have always tried to distance themselves from prying governments. Google's decision to snub the Senate Intelligence Committee[2] in early September, for instance, generated unease in the US, and Facebook's deteriorating relationship with the UK Parliament's digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS) select committee shows no sign of improving.Damian Collins MP, who is chairing the committee's inquiry into fake news, has often cut an exasperated figure in his attempts to pin down Mark Zuckerberg for questioning, and has found the firm's feet-dragging antics[3] a source of deep frustration. But this feeling hasn't been isolated to the inquiry. </p><p>While Silicon Valley and the UK government have shared an often fraught but generally constructive relationship, Collins' growing embitterment embodies a mood that's been bubbling up in Whitehall over the last six months or so. Suggestions of an independent regulator mark a significant step change that could signal the government has irreversibly lost its patience with the tech industry. Is the state set to take a much harder stance on big tech than ever before, or is this just a load of hot air?The L WordThe government's vehement opposition to encryption, deployed by the likes of WhatsApp to guarantee user privacy, is long-established, whether that was former Prime Minister David Cameron's suggestion that its end-to-end nature helps mask extremist activity, or Amber Rudd's suggestion that 'real people' don't care about encryption. But tough talk - whether on encryption or removing harmful content from social platforms - has normally been accompanied with solutions that prioritised self-policing, and cordial discussions, as opposed to compulsion via regulation or independent oversight. Silicon Valley has persistently ignored requests to grant law enforcement agencies backdoor access to seized communications data, mainly as the proposals put forward are seen as fundamentally flawed[4]. The government, meanwhile, has been reluctant to go any further, perhaps down to a desire to maintain positive relations with a sector bringing huge benefits to the UK economy, as well as a devotion to free-market principles. Thus the L word - legislation - has been kept off the table. But Sajid Javid's return from this year's meeting of Five Eyes ministers from the UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand marked a fundamental change in rhetoric[5],with his government signalling it's finally willing to act.Rejection proves to be the final strawJavid has demonstrated the new approach twice since flying back; first in a joint statement on encryption from the Five Eyes summit, and again on removing child sexual abuse content in a speech to the NSPCC[6]. On both matters, he delivered the same threat: take up our suggestions, or we'll force you to by law. While at odds with a government that has generally shied away from legislative action, these examples concern the very sensitive matters of national security and child safety. Patience, therefore, is limited. While it's difficult to pinpoint the exact turning point, perhaps it can be traced a few months back to the former DCMS secretary Matt Hancock's appearance on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Speaking to Marr, Hancock in anger disclosed how ten tech companies snubbed official talks over how to best-approach removing harmful content from their platforms, of 14 firms invited. The indifference shown by the industry, Hancock explained, led him to realise self-regulation was folly, and that new powers were needed to more effectively regulate big tech's worst tendencies. Four months later, the UK government has now set itself on a collision course with Silicon Valley as it threatens to publish legislation that will, for better or worse, force the tech industry to make fundamental changes.Who will blink first?Threats can, of course, be empty, and the government's employment of harsher rhetoric could be just another negotiating tactic; a bluff, to put it crudely. It's just as likely its patience has expired - a tactical decision to bait the industry into changing its ways. But there are several factors that cast doubt on this theory; first is the emotionally-charged nature of the major points of conflicts - national security and child safety - and second is the multilateral nature of this hardline approach. The UK's tougher stance on encryption was not taken in isolation, but alongside all Five Eyes nations in unison. The European Union, meanwhile, has recently signalled it's ready to issue social media firms heavy fines for failing to remove extremist material within one hour[7] of publication, with new laws set to be drafted this month. The ball is now in Silicon Valley's court, as its biggest players assess how to navigate a changing regulatory landscape. But if the industry's approach to Matt Hancock's consultation, or Facebook's to Damian Collins' fake news inquiry, or Google's to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, is anything to go by, they will meet any threats with a shrug.All out war in nobody's best interestsIn his speech to the NSPCC, Javid said the distance any new laws will go depends, at least in part, on the industry reaction. Requests range from reasonable - that companies should work to detect and block abusive content as it is being uploaded, or shutting down live streams - to the unworkable as the industry see it - granting authorities encryption-defying backdoor access to communications data. While it's plausible the industry will simply ignore the government's threats, it's far more likely we will see a compromise of some kind, as further regulation doesn't seem to be in either party's best interests. The 'reasonable' suggestions will almost certainly be implemented in some form, and work has already started - for example, Facebook's deployment of AI to detect illicit material[8] (albeit with lacklustre results). Not from government direction, mind, but rather to avoid the sort of PR catastrophe that sees your CEO repeatedly hauled before public committees, or sat in front of a webcam promising billions of users that steps are being taken. But on more contentious matters, such as encryption, there's unlikely to be any movement. WhatsApp's entire platform is centred on secure end-to-end communications, and the firm is completely unwilling to compromise on it[9]. Moreover, any backdoor into its encryption, even if it's sole purpose is for police agencies to access data, is just as likely to be exploited by criminals. Although Silicon Valley is fundamentally resistant to external oversight, it will be up to the government to decide whether these changes are enough to satisfy their demands - or to press ahead with plans to set up an internet regulator. Given the consistent reluctance to take any meaningful action, however, as well as the sheer complexity of implementing a mandatory code of conduct, it's likely Javid and his colleagues will cave, and drop the harshest aspects of any new proposals put forward to Parliament. Delays to contentious plans for mandatory age verification checks on porn sites[10], for instance, typify the dithering nature of the government's approach to regulating the internet. The prospect of a Labour government could also shake things up. Jeremy Corbyn has not shied away from flexing his muscle against big tech, but Labour was opaque on encryption and regulating online spaces in its last manifesto. It's very likely that Silicon Valley will have a much tougher fight on its hands against Labour than a corporate-friendly Conservative Party. There's also the issue of public fatigue. Several higher-priority battles are on the horizon, most notably the UK's as yet undecided relationship with the EU, consuming a vast amount of government bandwidth. With public opinion now shifting away from support for more surveillance powers[11] towards the idea of data protection and privacy rights, it's possible the government might lose its will to fight.

It was \"managing the challenges thrown up by the growth of the digital economy\" that he wanted to address.</p><p>Appearing before MPs a few weeks later, he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">fired off a warning shot</url>: \"Many people in this room are becoming vulnerable as a result of digital.\"</p><p>The subtext was clear: vengeance was coming - and he was the man to deliver it. Weeks later, the CMA launched a major investigation into online platforms and digital marketing. \"The work we do will open them up to greater scrutiny, and should give parliament and the public a better grip on what [they] are doing,\" said Lord Tyrie.</p><p>Today, however, just days before the CMA's final report is due to be published, things feel different. For starters, the tough-talking Lord is on the way out. Earlier this month, he said he would be stepping down from the role while pointing to the \"inherent limits\" of the post. </p><p>What's more, recent investigations into Big Tech have fallen short. The CMA's probe into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">Google's takeover of analytics firm Looker</url> was ultimately waved through and an investigation into Amazon's investment into Deliveroo       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">all but collapsed</url>. The latter \"was their flagship investigation for the year\", one source said. \"It came to nothing\". </p><p>Industry observers say there are questions about whether the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">CMA's tough stance on Big Tech</url> needs to change. Was Tyrie's approach too aggressive and unfocused? Perhaps.</p><p>\"They came in like a bull in a china shop and frankly made a bit of a meal of the Deliveroo situation,\" says Dominic Hallas, from the Coalition for a Digital Economy. \"It's important that the CMA takes the opportunity for a reset.\"</p><p>Right now, there is no time for a reset. The CMA's final report is due next week and will encompass everything from how Facebook and Google collect and use personal data, to how they glean ad revenue from newspaper content.</p><p>It's been a long time coming. By 2018, Google accounted for more than 90pc of all the UK revenues coming from search ads. Facebook soaked up half the \"display advertising\" revenue in the country. Both firms claim they play a positive role in innovation.</p><p>Yet, even so, the CMA is expected to put forward recommendations to curb their reach. Early proposals included forcing the pair, called a \"duopoly\", to share data with rivals and breaking up <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">Google's advertising engine</url>. </p><p>How likely those are to be implemented is unclear. After all, Google is a global company so a break up would have to be conducted on a global scale. That is no mean task.</p><p>Either way, there are things the CMA is likely to propose which would be easier to enforce: the idea of \"strategic market status\" being one, essentially preventing firms from being able to promote their own products over those of rivals. Another proposal is new rules to make Google and Facebook pay for media content - following a similar move in Australia.</p><p>Some are sceptical whether such rules would work here. Last week, ministers were understood to still be looking at the possibility, although sources said some within the Government were unenthusiastic. More broadly, within Westminster, appetite to rein in Big Tech appears to be on the wane. Covid-19 has meant <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/21/bloodbath-looms-tech-firms-competition-watchdog-sets-sights/\">ties between tech firms and government have never been stronger</url>.</p><p>This week will set the tone on whether appetite is also waning at the CMA, or whether it will seek further powers, propose wide-ranging, market-changing remedies. \"There was a big idea at the CMA that digital markets were hugely problematic and we needed to do more,\" an insider says. Now, this idea looks a less clear.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-63974581</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6077-VFV1-JCJY-G3CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 27, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Happy Monday to you. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Monday, October 29th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the button. It is looking like a pretty good start to trading this morning. Investors expected to start the new week on a strong note with Dow industrials up 126 points right now. That's a half of a percent higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;P is up almost one percent and the NASDAQ right now 71-point move higher is up better than one percent. This after the major indices capped off a volatility week last week with sharp declines on Friday. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 were down better than one percent on Friday. The NASDAQ down better than two percent on the heels of disappointing earnings from Amazon and Alphabet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets this morning have a firmer tone, European indices higher across the board, FT-100 up almost two percent, 125 points higher. CAC quarante in Paris is up almost one percent and the DAX Index in Germany up almost two percent, 198 points higher in Germany. In Asia overnight, markets finished mostly lower as you see there with the exception, Hong Kong. Shanghai Composite down sharply down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>Meanwhile, earnings certainly settling the tone from Wall Street this morning, several Dow components including Apple will be reporting their quarterly numbers this week. Investors are watching also G.E., the Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that the company may be forced to cut its dividend again. One of the top stories in the Journal. Bit of a merger Monday on Wall Street to tell you about.</p><p>IBM is acquiring Red Hat for $33 billion. This is IBM's largest acquisition ever. Red Hat shares are up 52 percent on the news. IBM shares off of the lows down 3-1/4 percent. Coming up. How the deal will drive growth at the struggling technology companies coming up.</p><p>Breaking news overnight. A plane crashes shortly after in Indonesia. Nearly 200 were onboard. We have the very latest on the search effort happening right now.</p><p>And then honoring the victims of the Tree Of Life Synagogue shooting. Thousands of people filling the streets last night in Pittsburgh after President Trump condemned the attack on Saturday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: This evil anti-semitic attack is an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity. It will require all of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-semitism from our world.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have the very latest coming up as the alleged shooter is set to appear in court today. All those stories coming up this Monday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle and the president of Maslansky and Partners, Lee Carter. Good to see you. Great show so far guys.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: Great to be here. Interesting times for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Sure is.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Yes. We've got -- we've got a lot of news and we've got an election in days.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Exactly. Well, and that could change a lot in terms of the agenda whether or not we see the economic agenda like another tax cut plan in place, Dagen, the rollback in regulations could be reversed. I don't know. I know the victory in the Senate side is going to be a big win for this president but certainly the House could do investigation after investigation of President Trump and his taxes and all that stuff.</p><p>That's what Jerry Nadler said as his priority if in fact he becomes the chairman of Oversight.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Right. A lot -- you will see a lot of investigation that are for show and nothing else if the Democrats win the House, but there is still some races in the Senate that are extremely, extremely close. Watching Nevada for example, Dean Heller in Nevada, the seat is up for grabs in State of Arizona between Martha McSally and Kyrsten Sinema, that's really important to watch.</p><p>So there are look -- they - it looks like there are some real Republican wins afoot in the Senate but it's still going to be a nail-biter of what? Eight days from now.</p><p>CARTER: No question because you've seen the polling flip, you know, we were certain things are going one way and then the next week you see that they're, you know, that same candidate is seven points ahead of somebody that they were behind. So, they were going to really have to watch this case-by-case, moment-by-moment. And as things are happening, the way that the candidates, the way that the parties are reacting to these big events, like the events that happened this weekend.</p><p>The sad, tragic event at the Synagogue this weekend. The way that people react to this is going to dictate how people behave. It really is. And we want to heal right and we want to see healers. We don't want to see finger pointing. And so I think that real leadership is tested this week.</p><p>BARTIROMO: People are shutting down the hate, they don't want it anymore.</p><p>CARTER: No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All of that coming up this hour. We got a big hour coming up. But first, this top story this hour and that is earning season is rolling on. Largely, we are in the second busiest week of the quarter in terms of earnings, Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook and ExxonMobil all reporting this week. That will set the tone for markets for sure. And we've got the October jobs' report coming out this Friday.</p><p>Expectations call for 190,000 jobs added to economy last month with the unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent. This would be for the month of October. Of course, November begins this week. Joining us now to talk all economics is JMP Securities President Mark Lehmann. And Mark, it is good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>MARK LEHMANN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your thoughts on the backdrop for investing right now. Earnings and this upcoming jobs' report. What do you expect?</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, the market has been dominated by news not by earnings as of -- as October has progressed and obviously last week was not a great week for the markets and October has been awful month. I think we're seeing the futures point a little higher, I think, you know, the VIX trading as high as it has. I think -- I think we've seen the highs of the year and the lows of the year so far.</p><p>And I think we're going to recover a little bit here going into the election and going into the fourth quarter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So more volatility is what you're --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEHMANN: I think volatility is going to reign supreme. I think we have a headline-driven market to date. I think investors for the first time in a while are not reacting to some good numbers. And that tells me something. We're seeing IPO pricing denigrate, go down a little bit here. We've seen some deals that have been cut in half in size and the deals are not really popping anymore. We've seen some deals break price.</p><p>SurveyMonkey which is high profile IPO in the third quarter broke price and sees trading below their IPO price. Those are warnings science that will tell you, we'll see a little bit of a tampering of the market but I'm not worried about the market going in '19, I think better days are still ahead.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The market shook off so much news all year. Every day there was something in the news cycle and the news cycle in the month of October if you look at it versus rest of the year isn't that much different but why is it that anything going on right now, the markets almost gone hyperbolic in terms of how they react to it.</p><p>LEHMANN: I think you said it well. I think we shook off a lot of bad news, and I think we shook off a lot of fear, let's use the China tensions that we've seen through the year and that continues to be in our backdrop and I think nobody expects that to end quickly and I think the specter of more tariffs and more back-and-forth is in front of us. I think there is also a question about the tax cuts and results on earnings.</p><p>What that means for comparisons going into '19, we have great comparisons 18 over 17, one of the comparisons looking at '19. And I just think more of more of that has grown into the market specter and that specter now is a little bit more cautious.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You have a major overreaction by investors to a little sliver of bad news. We've been talking about sales missing expectations for a revenue missing expectations for weeks now, but if you look at Amazon and the Wall Street Journal points this out today, that on Thursday evening, it posted a record -- a firm with a record third-quarter profit, right? It was 11 times more the profit was than the period a year earlier.</p><p>But it sales came up a little bit shorter of expectations. There were concerns about the forecast for the holiday season. But shares fell almost eight percent on Friday and that S&amp;P was only down 1.7 percent. Amazon stock is down 18 percent so far in the month October. That seems like an overreaction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But is it enough big since?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It is but -- and their concern is evaluation is what happens to stocks that people deem earlier over value. But that seems like a bit much, doesn't it?</p><p>LEHMANN: (INAUDIBLE) Saturday night is of exact same thing. So, what I'll -- what I'll tell you is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And he is a farmer.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEHMANN: No, listen. You're correct. And I think that's what happens when markets are tense and we have a very, very tense market. Stocks down 20 percent or $200 billion from its peak which is kind of an inspiring number. But you're right. People are a little bit nervous. I think the guidance that they give and they don't give long range guidance, they give very short guidance. Amazon is not one who guides two or three years in advance.</p><p>And I think they would loathe to go out on a limb here and say things are perfect. I don't think that make sense to them. I also think my money is on that company and another big tech company is who I really defining what's going on in this marketplace. Look at how much Red Hat just got acquired for because if they want to compete with Amazon web services, does that Amazon web services is worth 30 percent more than it was worth two days ago?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that is exactly. And when you start zeroing in where the growth is, part of the growth story in this economy is cloud computing. And that's what you've got going on this morning. IBM acquiring software and services company Red Hat for $33 billion. Huge premium, stock is up 50 percent. It's part of this efforts to boost the could computing services which Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison told us about last week.</p><p>He emphasized the importance of cloud technology in the future.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE: I think computing, I think computing -- cloud computing is going to -- you know, all these data centers that people have been building are going to gradually wither away and we're going to have a small number of these huge cloud networks. And because every other network looks like that, you know, people don't generate their own electricity.</p><p>People don't have wells for their own water. OK. In a few cases they do, but in the most case, we use the networks to buy electricity, the network to buy water, we're going to use network to buy computing and business applications and information. This is going to be on handful of clouds and most of the data is going to be in the Oracle database.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, Mark, we know this cloud computing is one of the growth spots. You just said something interesting about IPOs, a lot of these companies that wanted to go public are the pulling back, lowering the pricing, one broke price. Does that tell you anything about where growth is or isn't right now? What's behind this IPO issue?</p><p>LEHMANN: Yes. I don't think it tells me there is any big fear that the best and biggest can't go public, what it tells me is the ability for -- I won't say any company but the companies we've seen to price at this kind of extraordinary premiums and trade it up as much as they have has been tempered. And that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they stopped because market conditions?</p><p>LEHMANN: Market conditions and just because paying the kind of premiums and paying hand multiples I think -- and that had worked, like you said that had worked for a very long time. We saw every single cloud computing software company up that we took public, it was up 50, 70, 90 percent. That's going to slow down. That's fine. We don't -- we need a little bit of that tempering.</p><p>I think the greatest -- and we've seen headlines like Lyft and Uber all of those that may test 2019 IPO market, that's not going to slow that down. It's going to make other companies think about what's the proper valuation. You know, my banks recede a little bit on that (INAUDIBLE) and I think that's OK.</p><p>CARTER: So, I think it's something you said that you think that we've seen the highs and the lows this year. What makes you think that we've seen lows? And what should people be doing with the money right now? Where would you like to put it to work?</p><p>LEHMANN: Well, we've had a couple corrections like this back in the spring. If you look at your charts from February and couple months later, we had this kind of pullbacks that found a level and I think we're getting close to that. We've tested the lows of this cycle. Hopefully, going into election. I think people are going to look at what they've owned year-to- date, and surmise the last few weeks they've been selling.</p><p>I still think the growth of the market is in tech and you're seeing the kind of premium that IBM paid to acquire Red Hat. You know, the shareholders of that company who obviously are going to garner huge premium today making big investments to tech and I think you're going to reanalyze some of these companies were down 20, 30, 40. The number of tech companies in tech correction land are very, very high.</p><p>And I think people are going to take stock that look -- there is lots of capital on the sidelines. There's tons of money out for the M&amp;A market. And now you have a 20 to 50 percent off some of a lot of tech companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will the tax cut plan 2.0, the second tax cut plan, will that resonate with investors? This weekend, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told me he is, in fact, working on a second tax cut plan. Here is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE: The President wants to go even farther. He's really focused on the middle class. He disbelieves they're the ones who get squeezed the most. He's asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent. Middle- class tax cuts for workers and families. And so we'll be ready to move with that as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what -- so what you're saying -- I mean, the President sort of suggested that we were going to hear about this before the midterm elections. Obviously, there's nine days left then you're out of session, you're not going to be voting on this in the next nine days but are you saying that you're working on an additional 10 percent tax cut perhaps to be announced and to bring to a vote after midterm elections sometime fourth quarter?</p><p>BRADY: Perhaps but what the President was referring to and I wish some of his critics would have just simply asked, what he was talking about was when best do we introduce the bill or nonbinding resolution laying out, our commitment as Republicans to doing that which we talked about doing sometime in the next month or so. But in truth, the lame-duck is so unpredictable.</p><p>That period between the election in the end of the Congress, it really common sense tells you this is something that as Republicans retain the House and Senate that we'll advance in the new Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Will this resonate with investors get the markets to move higher or do you think worries about deficits and debt are going to be the driver for markets?</p><p>LEHMANN: It feels the latter to me. You know, this obviously surprised a lot of people when the announcement came when the President said it. I think the tax cuts as far as I can tell and as far as the pundits that I read, that hasn't been a winner issue right now for middle class of this country, saying the second historic tax cut is the middle-class tax cut tells me that the first tax cut wasn't the tax cuts for the middle class.</p><p>And I think that doesn't resonate I think with investors right now. That's what it tells me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Interesting.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I don't think investors are reacting to it at all because I don't think that it's going to get done quite frankly. And people are treating this second tax cut and the new tax cut for the middle class as it just political talk and not reality. And if anything, if they really try to put it -- push it through, it will ignite even more worries about the debt and the deficit quite frankly.</p><p>President Trump talked about cutting discretionary spending on five percent, that's ex-defense less than one percent of the Federal budget. It doesn't make --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And, you know, the problem is spending. Mark, it's good to see you.</p><p>LEHMANN: Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Mark Lehmann. Stay with us. Our jobs in America coverage Friday morning, 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the jobs are. That's coming up Friday morning. But first, the nation is in mourning this morning. The latest details on the Pittsburgh Synagogue attack as the suspect is due in court today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. The president just tweeted this. Here it is, \"There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent reporting of the news. The fake news media, the true enemy of the people must stop the open and obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage. And we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony. Fake news must end.\" Writes the president.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is this tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue, and the mourning continues. Thousands attending a vigil honoring the victims of the massacre. 11 people were killed, six others were injured. The suspect is set to appear in court today. Fox News' David Lee Miller is live in Pittsburgh this morning with more. David, good morning to you.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. The U.S. Attorney here in Pittsburgh has now started the process to seek the death penalty for 46-year-old Robert Bowers. Ultimately, that's a decision that is going to rest with the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p><p>Now, among other things, Bowers is charged with a hate crime, obstructing exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death. He also faces 11 state counts of homicide. And as you mentioned, at 1:30 this afternoon, he is going to make his initial court appearance here in Pittsburgh. It will be before a federal magistrate.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pittsburgh continues to grieve and recover from the tragedy. Last night, thousands turned out for an interfaith prayer vigil. And now, for the first time, survivors of the massacre are speaking out.</p><p>Barry Werber, who was only feet away from the shooter inside the synagogue miraculously went unnoticed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY WERBER, SURVIVOR, SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING: He didn't see us. Thank God. The only thing I had in my hand was the cell phone and it's a dumb phone, so it doesn't light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p>I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light as he opened the door. He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any attention, step back and walked out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILLER: On Sunday, authorities released the names of all 11 people who died. Among them we are told, there were at eight men and three women. They range in age from 54 to 97 years old. There were two brothers, as well as a married couple. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very sad to look at and to re-talk about the statement. Thank you, David Lee Miller, in Pittsburgh this morning.</p><p>Coming up, taking on technology, Google and Facebook may face billions of dollars in new taxes. We got the details there, coming up. And Elon Musk versus the Securities and Exchange Commission. Why the CEO of Tesla now says, $20 million fine against his company, it was all worth it. Later this hour, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. All 189 passengers and crew on board a Lion Air passenger jet are feared dead this morning. Cheryl Casone with the details. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Well, Maria, rescue officials in Indonesia finding some human remains. As one of those officials predicts there will be no survivors from this. The brand-new Lion Air Boeing 737 crashed into the Java Sea of the Indonesian coast.</p><p>The plane went down just minutes after taking off from Jakarta for an island off of Sumatra. The Transportation Ministry, says the pilot had asked for permission to return to the Jakarta Airport before the plane was lost on radar.</p><p>In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews have also found I.D. cards, personal belongings, and aircraft debris. This is the first known crash of the newer version of the 737.</p><p>While the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to prominent Democrats is said to make his first court appearance in Miami today. 56-year-old Cesar Sayoc is facing five federal charges and up to 48 years in prison.</p><p>He was arrested Friday, four days after the first package was found in New York. Single fingerprint led to the FBI -- led the FBI to his arrest. U.S. marshals are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City, where the Justice Department wants to trial him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern District.</p><p>Well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be seeking re-election as party chairwoman. She has been Germany's leader since 2005. She told leaders of her Christian Democratic Union Party that she wants to remain Chancellor only until 2021 when the next federal election is due. And this comes after her party lost significant ground in yesterday's regional elections in Germany.</p><p>Well, Google and Facebook could soon be hit with major tax hikes. The Wall Street Journal reports dozens of countries are stepping up efforts to levy new taxes on technology giants. They're hoping to capture revenue as economic activity increasingly shifts to online.</p><p>South Korea, India and, at least, seven other Asia-Pacific countries are exploring these new taxes as our Mexico, Chile, and other Latin American countries. Take a look at shares of Facebook and Google, they're higher in the pre-market, Maria.</p><p>But you know, the IMF warned about the economies of emerging markets having problems. I guess this is their fix. Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, right. Now, go where the money is, right. Cheryl, thank you. Coming up, countdown to the midterm elections. We break down how the economy may impact decisions for voters, coming up.</p><p>And then, an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox yesterday, the highlights from the World Series all here, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Monday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th, your top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast. Personal income and spending reports just hitting the tape. Personal income, coming out now, not a major market reaction but we are just getting the numbers right here, and we are awaiting these numbers. It has not typically been a market mover. Markets are up 151 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as you can see. Personal income up was two-tenths of a percent versus an estimate of up three-tenths of a percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, personal spending, is up four-tenths of a percent versus an expected increase of four-tenths, so it is right in line with the estimates. Futures, as you can see, trading higher this morning. Dow Industrials up 164 points, that's two-thirds of one percent. S&amp;P500 is up better than one percent, and the NASDAQ up 1-1/4 percent on the morning this morning. Futures indicating a pretty good opening for the Broader Averages after a tough week last week.</p><p>European indices also higher this morning. Take a look at European indices with the FTSE100 higher by 141 points, that's better than two percent -- this is the high of the morning right here. Things have been improving all morning. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 1-1/4 percent and the Dax, in Germany, up better than two percent right now. As we said, personal income up two-tenths of a percent versus three-tenths of a percent; and personal spending right in line with the estimates, up four-tenths of one percent. Asian markets overnight -- and futures, as you can see, are higher. Asian markets overnight, were mostly lower. As you can see, with the exception of Hong Kong up a fraction; Shanghai Composite down better than two percent overnight.</p><p>Voting to the right. Brazil electing a conservative candidate, who some have compared to President Trump. Of course, the alternative was the socialist candidate. We're breaking it all down for you this morning.</p><p>The $20 million tweet. Why Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the tweet that cost him all that money was actually worth it.</p><p>Plus, Boston's big win. The Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to the take the World Series yesterday. We have all the highlights in sports.</p><p>And then, place your bets. Details on the latest sports team to strike a sport gambling deal, coming up this morning as well.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, as we continue. President Trump just tweeting on Brazil's election, meanwhile, here is what he said, the president: \"Had a very good conversation with newly elected president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed Brazil and the United States will work closely together on trade, military, and everything else. Excellent call. Wished him congratulations,\" says the president. All that coming up, on Brazil.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour: 8 days to go until the midterm elections. President Trump, has been hitting the campaign trail every day to rally before the midterms. The recent economic swings put at forefront for voters. Joining us now, is Douglas Holtz-Eaken, he is former CBO Director from a McCain Economic Advisory and American Action Forum President. Douglas, good to see you. Thanks for joining us this morning.</p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's your outlook for the midterms, Doug?</p><p>EAKEN: Well, I think I don't know much more than the experts. And they suggest that the Republicans are going to lose control of the House, the Democrats will control the House. Republicans could pick up a seat in the Senate and that will leave us with a Congress that probably won't have the ability to get a whole lot of legislation done over the next few years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean if you were to see, the Democrats take the House which is largely expected, does the agenda that the president has been putting out, come to a halt?</p><p>EAKEN: It looks that way to me. It's very unlikely that they're going to pass anything to make the tax cuts permanent for example, which is going to be a very good idea. I don't see any real hope for further legislation other than, you know, getting the spending bills done, and that's keeping the government running, and that could run into something difficult.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I want to talk about this spending and these tax cuts because I know that you've been a deficit hawk and we want to talk about where we are in terms the debt and deficits, but we are looking at a potential tax break for middle class which is in the works. Pennsylvania Congressman Scott Perry joined us earlier, he said he's in favor of more tax cuts, congress needs to focus on less spending first, listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA: You don't fix your overspending problem by taxing people more, you fix that by spending less, and so that's what we really need to focus on. The president, offered a budget that spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up being. As a matter of fact, the tax proposal that House sent, the Senate, I think, saved $400 billion, but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion dollars additional spending. And unfortunately, to get something that allows the people to keep more what they earned has to make it through Senate as so long as that's full of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending, we're going to have this problem.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about that, Doug, can they stop spending? Or cut down on spending?</p><p>EAKEN: There's no evidence to that so far. No evidence so far. I mean, you and I had this conversation before. They're concentrating on the annual spending which is a third of the budget. No one is even talking about the two-thirds of the budget that's growing at -- you know, growth rates for the next 10 years of six percent for Social Security, 5.8 for Medicare, 5.2 for Medicaid.</p><p>Those are enormous growth rates, they have to come down, that's where the money is and there's no conversation about that. So, I'm sympathetic to the idea that we need a tax code that's permanent, this idea with of temporary tax cuts from the middle class makes no sense. They could do some things that are built on the success last December, but they really do have to get serious on the spending side, and they haven't.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so, where are the opportunities to spend less? Let's talk about that, because you know, Maya MacGuineas form the Committee for Responsible Budget is saying that the budget is in an unsustainable long- term trajectory. She writes, the federal debt already high and rising. The country's fiscal outlook in medium and long terms are both extremely troubling. And they're looking at long term outlook, where is the opportunity to cut spending, Doug?</p><p>EAKEN: Well, for the record, Maya is a crazy optimist -- it's a little worse than that, in my view. So, look, it's not complicated. The Social Security program, for example, is promising to cut benefits across the board by 25 percent, for people in retirement, in 12 years when it runs out of money. That's a terrible way to run a pension program. So, we should fix Social Security, we should fix Social Security right now.</p><p>There have been six or seven bipartisan commissions that put together proposals to get that done. That should be the number one objection for anybody. Why would we want to have something that retirees can't count on? Then you move over to the next big ones: Medicare and Medicaid. Those are programs that don't serve the beneficiaries very well at all. I mean, we know that our seniors don't get the health outcomes that other country seniors do, yet we spend so much money, indeed it has an unrestricted draw in the U.S. Treasury.</p><p>So, the first thing to do is put those programs on budget, make them live within a finite amount of money and serve the beneficiaries. And then, we can just move across the board, go to the farm programs, go to annual spending. There's lots of waste in there. And really, get serious about running these programs effectively.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, you need courage to be able to come out during an election year, and say, we're cutting back on your Social Security checks and your pension. But, clearly, you've got to go where money is. And then, there is this global market worrying over trade and tariffs, Senator Ron Johnson told me on Sunday that the president should keep the pressure on China since they pose more than just an economic threat, but is tariffs the answer? Here's what he said, Doug, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN: Let's face it, China has been stealing hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of our industrial secrets, as well as our military secrets, and that is really, I think, the biggest threat that we face in terms of our relationship with China.</p><p>I think the good news is because of public awareness, the gap between those on offense and those of us on defense, is quite honestly narrowing. And hopefully, if we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade and our dealings with China, we'll discipline them to begin -- you know, really, adhering to norms of the rest of the world trading system.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your take, Doug, is China going to adhere to the norms -- the rules of the world on the global basis or not?</p><p>EAKEN: Not without a lot of pressure. I think China really does not understand how far it is out of line with acceptable behavior.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>EAKEN: I think the important phrase there with Senator Johnson was a \"unified world,\" I don't think we have that. The administration has correctly identified China as problem, has been very aggressive in a bilateral fashion and trying to get China to change this behavior, that's been utterly unsuccessful. I think it will be unsuccessful but acting alone. The key is to get a multilateral approach where all of our key allies in Europe, and in Japan, and in other parts of the world agree to enforce better discipline on China. That's not happening right now, that's the missing piece in this strategy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I wonder if as he continues to do trade deals and confirms these deals with others, like a deal with E.U., you know, like when the new president in Mexico gets into place where you as actually see the commerce back-and-forth from the new USMCA deal, will that bring these countries together in a unified front against China?</p><p>EAKEN: It may, but it's a big if. They are the -- negotiated USMCA has a provision that says: \"Anyone who signs this cannot negotiate a free trade agreement with nonmarket economy,\" aimed directly at China. So, that makes sense. If you can get to those deals in place, and I'll point out, Canada and Mexico haven't signed that deal yet, there's been a lot of talk about it, but there's no signature, and it still -- we have to go through Congress as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>EAKEN: Going -- getting a deal with Europe takes time. So, all of these things are very time-consuming, and quite frankly, China has a much greater capacity, just wait us out. President Xi is a president for life, their capacity to directly intervene in the economy is enormous.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>EAKEN: And so, I worry about the time tables here, and I worry about whether there's enough pressure from enough countries to get things moving quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, we'll be watching that. Doug, it's always a pleasure to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>EAKEN: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Douglas Holtz-Eaken joining us there. Stay with Fox Business for a special midterm election coverage, it begins on November 6, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern, we are all hands-on deck. And then the next morning, MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, that's on November 7th. So, join us, as we bring you all the results from midterms.</p><p>First, though, Elon Musk is firing back. Why the Tesla CEO says 20- million-dollar fine against this his company was, well, it was worth, straight ahead. Then Brazil's next president; Stuart Varney weighs in on the country's elections back in a moment right here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Check out Tesla shares up this morning as CEO Elon Musk brushes off worries about an investigation into the infamous funding secure tweet. Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details there. Good morning, Susan.</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER: Good morning, Maria. That is right, the Tesla's CEO, well, still CEO, Elon Musk, says it was worth it, the $20 million in fines that he had to pay and Tesla had to pay for those tweets back in August, when he said funding was secured, he was taking the company private and that was at $420.</p><p>Well, don't forget, the SEC, of course, a part of that settlement says that Elon Musk, if he's going to tweet about Tesla, he has to go through the company's communications channels, so not sure if he's adhering to those procedures but he did say late on Friday after that tweet, less than an hour later, he says he's going to take a few days off the Twittersphere.</p><p>OK. Let's also talk about Wal-Mart. And I guess in this case, what Amazon can do, Wal-Mart will try to do better if they can, so they are launching their own cashier-less stores. They're testing something called Sam's Club Now, that will open in Dallas next week. They told us about this back in June, and it's pretty much similar to what Amazon Go is doing. So, they're employing mobile checkout, camera-like systems for inventory management, and I guess, they're still playing catchup to Amazon at this point. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Susan, thank you. We are watching markets today. We'll be watching you with a big rally expected at the opening of trading. Meanwhile, Brazil's next president, big story, conservative candidate Jair Bolsonaro is claiming victory this morning in his country's election. Joining us now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney. Good morning to you, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. Look, I don't think that the election of Jair Bolsonaro is going to have that much effect on our daily lives in America or our economy or our market, but it really is another marker on an extraordinarily populist trend. I think it started with Brexit, it continued with the election of Donald Trump in November 2016, then it's the five-star movement in Italy, a populist movement, which runs Italy, and which may well break up the European Union. And now, Brazil, it's the largest country in Latin America, 210 million Brazilians, the largest economy in Latin America, and it's going to be run by a conservative. This is quite something. So, it's in with the new, which seems to be populism, and out with the old. I'm sure you've reported it, Maria, but Angela Merkel, she's stepping down as the leader of her party, and will try to finish out her term as Chancellor of Germany. But whether she makes that or not is another story.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: She is out, and the populists in Brazil, Italy, America, elsewhere are in. What a trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think -- I think it's also important to note that look what the alternative was, Stu, if you didn't vote in Brazil for Bolsonaro, you were voting for a socialist. So, once again, socialism was tested here.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're looking at socialism sort of testing the waters across the world. People are not having it.</p><p>VARNEY: I wonder if it has an implication for our elections in eight days here. After all, the Democrats could be characterized as moving rapidly towards socialism, and President Trump, you could characterize him as a populist, if you like. That's the contest that we face in eight days' time. I just wonder if these worldwide trends will play out here, all over again.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It really seems like it is taking a hold across the world. In people -- in places you didn't expect like Italy, as you mentioned.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, yes. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, I know you're going to have a lot more in 10 minutes. We will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern. Do not miss Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>But first, there's this, hockey's new bet, details on the partnership between the New Jersey Devils and sports book operator William Hill. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So, the New Jersey Devils getting into the legal gambling business. The NHL team making a multi-year deal with William Hill, to provide legalized gambling inside the Prudential Center, where they play. Joining us now is the CEO of William Hill U.S., Joe Asher. Joe, great to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JOE ASHER, CEO, WILLIAM HILL U.S.: Hey, good morning. Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, congratulations.! This has been a long-term investment for William Hill, right?</p><p>ASHER: Well, it is. You know, we've been working towards the day when sports betting would become legal outside Nevada, and of course, that day came about five months ago when the Supreme Court overturned the federal law that had prevented that. And we are going to New Jersey pretty shortly thereafter, and recently announced the deal with the Devils and we're excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How much -- what kind of revenue are you talking about? What are you expecting in terms of the revenue that this will bring in?</p><p>ASHER: Well, across the country, I mean, you're looking at a market that the estimates are somewhere between 150 to $400 billion in the amount waged; figured about five or six percent that comes into revenue. So, it's a substantial market across the country, but of course, that's going to develop over a period of years, as states begin to legalize sports betting at the state level. You know, the Supreme Court basically turned the issue back to the states. States like Delaware, NEW Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia got going quickly, and others are in the process, and it will develop over the next few years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Joe, Mitch Roschelle, good morning. Is the plan to expand across multiple states or is the plan in New Jersey to expand in the State of New Jersey?</p><p>ASHER: Well, our plan, of course, is to do both, Mitch. We've opened already at about a dozen locations in Mississippi, one in West Virginia. We're gearing up to get going in the not too distant future in Pennsylvania and in Rhode Island. And in New Jersey, we've just opened up our third retail location, but also in New Jersey, you can bet online by just downloading the app in the App Store, and you can bet from anywhere within the state, but you do have to be present within the State of New Jersey in that case to place your bets. You know, out here in Nevada, you've been able to bet on sports for decades, and you go into a casino, you sign up for your mobile account here in the State of Nevada and then you can bet anywhere within the state. Right now, we do about two-thirds of our business on mobile.</p><p>CARTER: So, you're just betting on the -- you know, you're at -- you're at a Devils game, you're just betting on that game or can you bet on all sports? Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like for them?</p><p>ASHER: Sure, you can bet -- you can bet on all sports within the -- within the State of New Jersey. Just like, you know, like I was at the Golden Knights game here in Las Vegas last night, really, really exciting game and they do a great job there, but not only were people betting on the Golden Knights game, they're betting on other hockey games that are going on. And now, of course, this is a busy time in the sporting calendar, last night, you had the last game of the World Series, basketball is getting going, we're in the middle of football season. So, there's a lot of -- there's a lot going on in the sporting calendar, which makes it a busy time of the year for us.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joe, it's Dagen McDowell, name a sport that people might be surprised that people bet on so much. Like -- go ahead.</p><p>ASHER: No, I was going to say one of -- one of the big -- so, right now, we do about -- here in Nevada, we do about 37 percent of our business on what we call \"in-play sports,\" or betting after the game has started. The number one sport for in-play by far is Major League Baseball, because the pace of the game is so conducive to it. But also, tennis is a -- is a big game that -- or a big sport for in-play wagering.</p><p>LEE: I would not expect tennis.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes. But people -- but again, it's -- because it's only two players, and/or in singles as two players, you can see if somebody looks fatigued.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Has gotten inside of their own head. And so, that's when you place in in-play bet maybe.</p><p>ASHER: Oh, you know, it's got --</p><p>MCDOWELL: (INAUDIBLE) from experience.</p><p>ASHER: Yes, you know, look, it allows you to take a bigger game then chop it down into a much shorter interval. So, for instance, in baseball, people like to bet will there be run scored in the next inning, yes or no. There's an actual break period in between innings, and we'll have people bet substantial sums of moment just on the next inning. You're taking a three-hour game, you're chopping it down to a 20-minute game. Tennis, same sort of thing, people will bet set by set or game by game, and you're taking a longer event and chopping it down into a much shorter event so people can make their bet, know whether they won or loss in a short period of time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very cool. Joe, great to have you, thanks so much. We'll be watching.</p><p>ASHER: All right. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joe Asher, joining us there. Coming up, final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us. Back in moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lee Carter.</p><p>CARTER: I am looking forward to seeing how this week plays out in polling coming out to the midterms. I think that this week could surprise us all, and I think it's going to be a week that's going to lean Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really? All right.</p><p>CARTER: They do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Eight days away from the Midterms. Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: The Fed's preferred inflation measure, PCE, just came out, it's still flat at two percent which is the Fed's target. So, let's see if the Fed holds off and doesn't continue to raise rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why do we need a rate hike in December, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Jon Hilsenrath has co-wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal that starts at \"What If That Was as Good as It Gets In Terms of the Economy?\" Well, we're looking at 3.1 percent wage growth coming up this Friday for last month, that would be the best in 9-1/2 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is good stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Have a great day, everybody. Go seize the day! Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Lee Carter, great to see you. Let's get right to Stuart. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now. Stuart, take it away.</p><p>VARNEY: Good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Good Monday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.  Happy Monday to you.  I'm Maria Bartiromo  and it is Monday, October 29th.  Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on  the button.  It is looking like a pretty good start to trading this  morning.  Investors expected to start the new week on a strong note with  Dow industrials up 126 points right now.  That's a half of a percent  higher.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The S&amp;P is up almost one percent and the NASDAQ right now 71-point move  higher is up better than one percent.  This after the major indices capped  off a volatility week last week with sharp declines on Friday.  The Dow and  the S&amp;P 500 were down better than one percent on Friday.  The NASDAQ down  better than two percent on the heels of disappointing earnings from Amazon  and Alphabet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global markets this morning have a firmer tone, European indices higher  across the board, FT-100 up almost two percent, 125 points higher.  CAC  quarante in Paris is up almost one percent and the DAX Index in Germany up  almost two percent, 198 points higher in Germany.  In Asia overnight,  markets finished mostly lower as you see there with the exception, Hong  Kong.  Shanghai Composite down sharply down better than two percent  overnight.</p><p>Meanwhile, earnings certainly settling the tone from Wall Street this  morning, several Dow components including Apple will be reporting their  quarterly numbers this week.  Investors are watching also G.E., the Wall  Street Journal is reporting this morning that the company may be forced to  cut its dividend again.  One of the top stories in the Journal.  Bit of a  merger Monday on Wall Street to tell you about.</p><p>IBM is acquiring Red Hat for $33 billion.  This is IBM's largest  acquisition ever.  Red Hat shares are up 52 percent on the news.  IBM  shares off of the lows down 3-1/4 percent.  Coming up.  How the deal will  drive growth at the struggling technology companies coming up.  </p><p>Breaking news overnight.  A plane crashes shortly after in Indonesia.   Nearly 200 were onboard.  We have the very latest on the search effort  happening right now. </p><p>And then honoring the victims of the Tree Of Life Synagogue shooting.   Thousands of people filling the streets last night in Pittsburgh after  President Trump condemned the attack on Saturday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES: This evil anti-semitic attack is  an assault on all of us, it's an assault on humanity.  It will require all  of us working together to extract the hateful poison of anti-semitism from  our world.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest coming up as the alleged shooter is set  to appear in court today.  All those stories coming up this Monday morning  and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell,  PwC Partner Mitch Roschelle and the president of Maslansky and Partners,  Lee Carter.  Good to see you.  Great show so far guys.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS:  Great to be here.   Interesting times for sure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Sure is.  </p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC:  Yes.  We've got -- we've got a lot of news  and we've got an election in days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Exactly. Well, and that could change a lot in terms of  the agenda whether or not we see the economic agenda like another tax cut  plan in place, Dagen, the rollback in regulations could be reversed.  I  don't know.  I know the victory in the Senate side is going to be a big win  for this president but certainly the House could do investigation after  investigation of President Trump and his taxes and all that stuff.</p><p>That's what Jerry Nadler said as his priority if in fact he becomes the  chairman of Oversight.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Right.  A lot -- you will see  a lot of investigation that are for show and nothing else if the Democrats  win the House, but there is still some races in the Senate that are  extremely, extremely close.  Watching Nevada for example, Dean Heller in  Nevada, the seat is up for grabs in State of Arizona between Martha McSally  and Kyrsten Sinema, that's really important to watch.</p><p>So there are look -- they - it looks like there are some real Republican  wins afoot in the Senate but it's still going to be a nail-biter of what?   Eight days from now.  </p><p>CARTER:  No question because you've seen the polling flip, you know, we  were certain things are going one way and then the next week you see that  they're, you know, that same candidate is seven points ahead of somebody  that they were behind.  So, they were going to really have to watch this  case-by-case, moment-by-moment.  And as things are happening, the way that  the candidates, the way that the parties are reacting to these big events,  like the events that happened this weekend.</p><p>The sad, tragic event at the Synagogue this weekend.  The way that people  react to this is going to dictate how people behave.  It really is.  And we  want to heal right and we want to see healers.  We don't want to see finger  pointing.  And so I think that real leadership is tested this week.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  People are shutting down the hate, they don't want it anymore.  </p><p>CARTER:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All of that coming up this hour.  We got a big hour coming up.   But first, this top story this hour and that is earning season is rolling  on.  Largely, we are in the second busiest week of the quarter in terms of  earnings, Apple, Starbucks, General Electric, Facebook and ExxonMobil all  reporting this week.  That will set the tone for markets for sure.  And  we've got the October jobs' report coming out this Friday.</p><p>Expectations call for 190,000 jobs added to economy last month with the  unemployment rate remaining steady at 3.7 percent.  This would be for the  month of October.  Of course, November begins this week.  Joining us now to  talk all economics is JMP Securities President Mark Lehmann.  And Mark, it  is good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>MARK LEHMANN, PRESIDENT, JMP SECURITIES:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your thoughts on the backdrop for investing right now.   Earnings and this upcoming jobs' report.  What do you expect?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, the market has been dominated by news not by earnings as of  -- as October has progressed and obviously last week was not a great week  for the markets and October has been awful month.  I think we're seeing the  futures point a little higher, I think, you know, the VIX trading as high  as it has.  I think -- I think we've seen the highs of the year and the  lows of the year so far.</p><p>And I think we're going to recover a little bit here going into the  election and going into the fourth quarter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So more volatility is what you're -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)  </p><p>LEHMANN:  I think volatility is going to reign supreme.  I think we have a  headline-driven market to date.  I think investors for the first time in a  while are not reacting to some good numbers.  And that tells me something.   We're seeing IPO pricing denigrate, go down a little bit here.  We've seen  some deals that have been cut in half in size and the deals are not really  popping anymore.  We've seen some deals break price.</p><p>SurveyMonkey which is high profile IPO in the third quarter broke price and  sees trading below their IPO price.  Those are warnings science that will  tell you, we'll see a little bit of a tampering of the market but I'm not  worried about the market going in '19, I think better days are still ahead.  </p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The market shook off so much news all year.  Every day there  was something in the news cycle and the news cycle in the month of October  if you look at it versus rest of the year isn't that much different but why  is it that anything going on right now, the markets almost gone hyperbolic  in terms of how they react to it.  </p><p>LEHMANN:  I think you said it well.  I think we shook off a lot of bad  news, and I think we shook off a lot of fear, let's use the China tensions  that we've seen through the year and that continues to be in our backdrop  and I think nobody expects that to end quickly and I think the specter of  more tariffs and more back-and-forth is in front of us.  I think there is  also a question about the tax cuts and results on earnings.</p><p>What that means for comparisons going into '19, we have great comparisons  18 over 17, one of the comparisons looking at '19.  And I just think more  of more of that has grown into the market specter and that specter now is a  little bit more cautious.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  You have a major overreaction by investors to a little sliver of  bad news.  We've been talking about sales missing expectations for a  revenue missing expectations for weeks now, but if you look at Amazon and  the Wall Street Journal points this out today, that on Thursday evening, it  posted a record -- a firm with a record third-quarter profit, right?  It  was 11 times more the profit was than the period a year earlier.</p><p>But it sales came up a little bit shorter of expectations.  There were  concerns about the forecast for the holiday season.  But shares fell almost  eight percent on Friday and that S&amp;P was only down 1.7 percent.  Amazon  stock is down 18 percent so far in the month October.  That seems like an  overreaction.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But is it enough big since?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It is but -- and their concern is evaluation is what happens to  stocks that people deem earlier over value.  But that seems like a bit  much, doesn't it?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  (INAUDIBLE) Saturday night is of exact same thing.  So, what I'll  -- what I'll tell you is --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And he is a farmer. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LEHMANN:  No, listen.  You're correct.  And I think that's what happens  when markets are tense and we have a very, very tense market.  Stocks down  20 percent or $200 billion from its peak which is kind of an inspiring  number.  But you're right.  People are a little bit nervous.  I think the  guidance that they give and they don't give long range guidance, they give  very short guidance.  Amazon is not one who guides two or three years in  advance.</p><p>And I think they would loathe to go out on a limb here and say things are  perfect.  I don't think that make sense to them.  I also think my money is  on that company and another big tech company is who I really defining  what's going on in this marketplace.  Look at how much Red Hat just got  acquired for because if they want to compete with Amazon web services, does  that Amazon web services is worth 30 percent more than it was worth two  days ago?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that is exactly.  And when you start zeroing in where the  growth is, part of the growth story in this economy is cloud computing.   And that's what you've got going on this morning.  IBM acquiring software  and services company Red Hat for $33 billion.  Huge premium, stock is up 50  percent.  It's part of this efforts to boost the could computing services  which Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison told us about last week.</p><p>He emphasized the importance of cloud technology in the future.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>LARRY ELLISON, CO-FOUNDER, ORACLE:  I think computing, I think computing --  cloud computing is going to -- you know, all these data centers that people  have been building are going to gradually wither away and we're going to  have a small number of these huge cloud networks.  And because every other  network looks like that, you know, people don't generate their own  electricity.</p><p>People don't have wells for their own water.  OK.  In a few cases they do,  but in the most case, we use the networks to buy electricity, the network  to buy water, we're going to use network to buy computing and business  applications and information.  This is going to be on handful of clouds and  most of the data is going to be in the Oracle database.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, Mark, we know this cloud computing is one of the growth  spots.  You just said something interesting about IPOs, a lot of these  companies that wanted to go public are the pulling back, lowering the  pricing, one broke price.  Does that tell you anything about where growth  is or isn't right now?  What's behind this IPO issue?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Yes.  I don't think it tells me there is any big fear that the  best and biggest can't go public, what it tells me is the ability for -- I  won't say any company but the companies we've seen to price at this kind of  extraordinary premiums and trade it up as much as they have has been  tempered.  And that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So they stopped because market conditions?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  Market conditions and just because paying the kind of premiums  and paying hand multiples I think -- and that had worked, like you said  that had worked for a very long time.  We saw every single cloud computing  software company up that we took public, it was up 50, 70, 90 percent.   That's going to slow down.  That's fine.  We don't -- we need a little bit  of that tempering.</p><p>I think the greatest -- and we've seen headlines like Lyft and Uber all of  those that may test 2019 IPO market, that's not going to slow that down.   It's going to make other companies think about what's the proper valuation.   You know, my banks recede a little bit on that (INAUDIBLE) and I think  that's OK.  </p><p>CARTER:  So, I think it's something you said that you think that we've seen  the highs and the lows this year.  What makes you think that we've seen  lows?  And what should people be doing with the money right now?  Where  would you like to put it to work?</p><p>LEHMANN:  Well, we've had a couple corrections like this back in the  spring.  If you look at your charts from February and couple months later,  we had this kind of pullbacks that found a level and I think we're getting  close to that.  We've tested the lows of this cycle.  Hopefully, going into  election.  I think people are going to look at what they've owned year-to- date, and surmise the last few weeks they've been selling.</p><p>I still think the growth of the market is in tech and you're seeing the  kind of premium that IBM paid to acquire Red Hat.  You know, the  shareholders of that company who obviously are going to garner huge premium  today making big investments to tech and I think you're going to reanalyze  some of these companies were down 20, 30, 40.  The number of tech companies  in tech correction land are very, very high.</p><p>And I think people are going to take stock that look -- there is lots of  capital on the sidelines.  There's tons of money out for the M&amp;A market.   And now you have a 20 to 50 percent off some of a lot of tech companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will the tax cut plan 2.0, the second tax cut plan, will that  resonate with investors?  This weekend, House Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Kevin Brady told me he is, in fact, working on a second tax cut  plan.  Here is what he said.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE:  The  President wants to go even farther.  He's really focused on the middle  class.  He disbelieves they're the ones who get squeezed the most.  He's  asked us and we worked with him on developing another 10 percent.  Middle- class tax cuts for workers and families.  And so we'll be ready to move  with that as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what -- so what you're saying -- I mean, the President sort  of suggested that we were going to hear about this before the midterm  elections.  Obviously, there's nine days left then you're out of session,  you're not going to be voting on this in the next nine days but are you  saying that you're working on an additional 10 percent tax cut perhaps to  be announced and to bring to a vote after midterm elections sometime fourth  quarter?  </p><p>BRADY:  Perhaps but what the President was referring to and I wish some of  his critics would have just simply asked, what he was talking about was  when best do we introduce the bill or nonbinding resolution laying out, our  commitment as Republicans to doing that which we talked about doing  sometime in the next month or so.  But in truth, the lame-duck is so  unpredictable.</p><p>That period between the election in the end of the Congress, it really  common sense tells you this is something that as Republicans retain the  House and Senate that we'll advance in the new Congress.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Will this resonate with investors get the markets to move  higher or do you think worries about deficits and debt are going to be the  driver for markets?  </p><p>LEHMANN:  It feels the latter to me.  You know, this obviously surprised a  lot of people when the announcement came when the President said it.  I  think the tax cuts as far as I can tell and as far as the pundits that I  read, that hasn't been a winner issue right now for middle class of this  country, saying the second historic tax cut is the middle-class tax cut  tells me that the first tax cut wasn't the tax cuts for the middle class.</p><p>And I think that doesn't resonate I think with investors right now.  That's  what it tells me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Interesting.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, I don't think investors are reacting to it at all because  I don't think that it's going to get done quite frankly.  And people are  treating this second tax cut and the new tax cut for the middle class as it  just political talk and not reality.  And if anything, if they really try  to put it -- push it through, it will ignite even more worries about the  debt and the deficit quite frankly.</p><p>President Trump talked about cutting discretionary spending on five  percent, that's ex-defense less than one percent of the Federal budget.  It  doesn't make -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And, you know, the problem is spending.  Mark, it's good to see  you.</p><p>LEHMANN:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  Mark Lehmann.  Stay with us.  Our jobs in  America coverage Friday morning, 8:00 a.m. Eastern as we identify where the  jobs are.  That's coming up Friday morning.  But first, the nation is in  mourning this morning.  The latest details on the Pittsburgh Synagogue  attack as the suspect is due in court today.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  The president just tweeted this.  Here it is,  \"There is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even  fraudulent reporting of the news.  The fake news media, the true enemy of  the people must stop the open and obvious hostility and report the news  accurately and fairly that will do much to put out the flame of anger and  outrage.  And we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and  harmony.  Fake news must end.\"  Writes the president.</p><p>Meanwhile, there is this tragedy at the Tree of Life synagogue, and the  mourning continues.  Thousands attending a vigil honoring the victims of  the massacre.  11 people were killed, six others were injured.  The suspect  is set to appear in court today.  Fox News' David Lee Miller is live in  Pittsburgh this morning with more.  David, good morning to you.</p><p>DAVID LEE MILLER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning, Maria.  The U.S.  Attorney here in Pittsburgh has now started the process to seek the death  penalty for 46-year-old Robert Bowers.  Ultimately, that's a decision that  is going to rest with the Attorney General Jeff Sessions.</p><p>Now, among other things, Bowers is charged with a hate crime, obstructing  exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death.  He also faces 11 state  counts of homicide.  And as you mentioned, at 1:30 this afternoon, he is  going to make his initial court appearance here in Pittsburgh.  It will be  before a federal magistrate.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pittsburgh continues to grieve and recover from the tragedy.   Last night, thousands turned out for an interfaith prayer vigil.  And now,  for the first time, survivors of the massacre are speaking out.</p><p>Barry Werber, who was only feet away from the shooter inside the synagogue  miraculously went unnoticed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARRY WERBER, SURVIVOR, SYNAGOGUE SHOOTING:  He didn't see us.  Thank God.   The only thing I had in my hand was the cell phone and it's a dumb phone,  so it doesn't light up when I'm talking on it.</p><p>I could see that he looked around only because there was a shaft of light  as he opened the door.  He stepped over Mel's body, didn't pay any  attention, step back and walked out.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MILLER:  On Sunday, authorities released the names of all 11 people who  died.  Among them we are told, there were at eight men and three women.   They range in age from 54 to 97 years old.  There were two brothers, as  well as a married couple.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very sad to look at and to re-talk about the statement.  Thank  you, David Lee Miller, in Pittsburgh this morning.</p><p>Coming up, taking on technology, Google and Facebook may face billions of  dollars in new taxes.  We got the details there, coming up.  And Elon Musk  versus the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Why the CEO of Tesla now  says, $20 million fine against his company, it was all worth it.  Later  this hour, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  All 189 passengers and crew on board a Lion Air  passenger jet are feared dead this morning.  Cheryl Casone with the  details.  Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Well, Maria, rescue officials  in Indonesia finding some human remains.  As one of those officials  predicts there will be no survivors from this.  The brand-new Lion Air  Boeing 737 crashed into the Java Sea of the Indonesian coast.</p><p>The plane went down just minutes after taking off from Jakarta for an  island off of Sumatra.  The Transportation Ministry, says the pilot had  asked for permission to return to the Jakarta Airport before the plane was  lost on radar.</p><p>In addition to the human remains that were found, search and rescue crews  have also found I.D. cards, personal belongings, and aircraft debris.  This  is the first known crash of the newer version of the 737.</p><p>While the Florida man accused of sending at least 14 pipe bombs to  prominent Democrats is said to make his first court appearance in Miami  today.  56-year-old Cesar Sayoc is facing five federal charges and up to 48  years in prison.</p><p>He was arrested Friday, four days after the first package was found in New  York.  Single fingerprint led to the FBI -- led the FBI to his arrest.   U.S. marshals are expected to transfer Sayoc to New York City, where the  Justice Department wants to trial him in the U.S. Attorney's Southern  District.</p><p>Well, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not be seeking re-election as  party chairwoman.  She has been Germany's leader since 2005.  She told  leaders of her Christian Democratic Union Party that she wants to remain  Chancellor only until 2021 when the next federal election is due.  And this  comes after her party lost significant ground in yesterday's regional  elections in Germany.</p><p>Well, Google and Facebook could soon be hit with major tax hikes.  The Wall  Street Journal reports dozens of countries are stepping up efforts to levy  new taxes on technology giants.  They're hoping to capture revenue as  economic activity increasingly shifts to online.</p><p>South Korea, India and, at least, seven other Asia-Pacific countries are  exploring these new taxes as our Mexico, Chile, and other Latin American  countries.  Take a look at shares of Facebook and Google, they're higher in  the pre-market, Maria.</p><p>But you know, the IMF warned about the economies of emerging markets having  problems.  I guess this is their fix.  Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, right.  Now, go where the money is, right.  Cheryl, thank  you.  Coming up, countdown to the midterm elections.  We break down how the  economy may impact decisions for voters, coming up.</p><p>And then, an incredible win for the Boston Red Sox yesterday, the  highlights from the World Series all here, stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Monday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Monday, October 29th, your  top stories right now 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.  Personal income and  spending reports just hitting the tape.  Personal income, coming out now,  not a major market reaction but we are just getting the numbers right here,  and we are awaiting these numbers.  It has not typically been a market  mover.  Markets are up 151 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, as  you can see.  Personal income up was two-tenths of a percent versus an  estimate of up three-tenths of a percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, personal spending, is up four-tenths of a percent versus an  expected increase of four-tenths, so it is right in line with the  estimates.  Futures, as you can see, trading higher this morning.  Dow  Industrials up 164 points, that's two-thirds of one percent.  S&amp;P500 is up  better than one percent, and the NASDAQ up 1-1/4 percent on the morning  this morning.

Take a look at European indices  with the FTSE100 higher by 141 points, that's better than two percent --  this is the high of the morning right here.  Things have been improving all  morning.  CAC Quarante in Paris is up 1-1/4 percent and the Dax, in  Germany, up better than two percent right now.  As we said, personal income  up two-tenths of a percent versus three-tenths of a percent; and personal  spending right in line with the estimates, up four-tenths of one percent.   Asian markets overnight -- and futures, as you can see, are higher.  Asian  markets overnight, were mostly lower.  As you can see, with the exception  of Hong Kong up a fraction; Shanghai Composite down better than two percent  overnight.  </p><p>Voting to the right.  Brazil electing a conservative candidate, who some  have compared to President Trump.  Of course, the alternative was the  socialist candidate.  We're breaking it all down for you this morning.  </p><p>The $20 million tweet.  Why Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the tweet that cost  him all that money was actually worth it.  </p><p>Plus, Boston's big win.  The Red Sox beating the L.A. Dodgers to the take  the World Series yesterday.  We have all the highlights in sports.  </p><p>And then, place your bets.  Details on the latest sports team to strike a  sport gambling deal, coming up this morning as well.  </p><p>All those stories coming up this morning, as we continue.  President Trump  just tweeting on Brazil's election, meanwhile, here is what he said, the  president: \"Had a very good conversation with newly elected president of  Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin.  We  agreed Brazil and the United States will work closely together on trade,  military, and everything else.  Excellent call.  Wished him  congratulations,\" says the president.  All that coming up, on Brazil.  </p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour: 8 days to go until the midterm  elections.  President Trump, has been hitting the campaign trail every day  to rally before the midterms.  The recent economic swings put at forefront  for voters.  Joining us now, is Douglas Holtz-Eaken, he is former CBO  Director from a McCain Economic Advisory and American Action Forum  President.  Douglas, good to see you.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p>DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKEN, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM:  Good morning.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's your outlook for the midterms, Doug?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Well, I think I don't know much more than the experts.  And they  suggest that the Republicans are going to lose control of the House, the  Democrats will control the House.  Republicans could pick up a seat in the  Senate and that will leave us with a Congress that probably won't have the  ability to get a whole lot of legislation done over the next few years.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I mean if you were to see, the Democrats take the House  which is largely expected, does the agenda that the president has been  putting out, come to a halt?  </p><p>EAKEN:  It looks that way to me.  It's very unlikely that they're going to  pass anything to make the tax cuts permanent for example, which is going to  be a very good idea.  I don't see any real hope for further legislation  other than, you know, getting the spending bills done, and that's keeping  the government running, and that could run into something difficult.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I want to talk about this spending and these tax cuts  because I know that you've been a deficit hawk and we want to talk about  where we are in terms the debt and deficits, but we are looking at a  potential tax break for middle class which is in the works.  Pennsylvania  Congressman Scott Perry joined us earlier, he said he's in favor of more  tax cuts, congress needs to focus on less spending first, listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. SCOTT PERRY (R), PENNSYLVANIA:  You don't fix your overspending  problem by taxing people more, you fix that by spending less, and so that's  what we really need to focus on.  The president, offered a budget that  spent less and we didn't take much or any of it up being.  As a matter of  fact, the tax proposal that House sent, the Senate, I think, saved $400  billion, but yet the Senate sent it back with a trillion dollars additional  spending.  And unfortunately, to get something that allows the people to  keep more what they earned has to make it through Senate as so long as  that's full of liberal folks that don't want to cut spending, we're going  to have this problem.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about that, Doug, can they stop spending?  Or cut down on  spending?  </p><p>EAKEN:  There's no evidence to that so far.  No evidence so far.  I mean,  you and I had this conversation before.  They're concentrating on the  annual spending which is a third of the budget.  No one is even talking  about the two-thirds of the budget that's growing at -- you know, growth  rates for the next 10 years of six percent for Social Security, 5.8 for  Medicare, 5.2 for Medicaid.  </p><p>Those are enormous growth rates, they have to come down, that's where the  money is and there's no conversation about that.  So, I'm sympathetic to  the idea that we need a tax code that's permanent, this idea with of  temporary tax cuts from the middle class makes no sense.  They could do  some things that are built on the success last December, but they really do  have to get serious on the spending side, and they haven't.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so, where are the opportunities to spend less?  Let's talk  about that, because you know, Maya MacGuineas form the Committee for  Responsible Budget is saying that the budget is in an unsustainable long- term trajectory.  She writes, the federal debt already high and rising.   The country's fiscal outlook in medium and long terms are both extremely  troubling.  And they're looking at long term outlook, where is the  opportunity to cut spending, Doug?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Well, for the record, Maya is a crazy optimist -- it's a little  worse than that, in my view.  So, look, it's not complicated.  The Social  Security program, for example, is promising to cut benefits across the  board by 25 percent, for people in retirement, in 12 years when it runs out  of money.  That's a terrible way to run a pension program.  So, we should  fix Social Security, we should fix Social Security right now.  </p><p>There have been six or seven bipartisan commissions that put together  proposals to get that done.  That should be the number one objection for  anybody.  Why would we want to have something that retirees can't count on?   Then you move over to the next big ones: Medicare and Medicaid.  Those are  programs that don't serve the beneficiaries very well at all.  I mean, we  know that our seniors don't get the health outcomes that other country  seniors do, yet we spend so much money, indeed it has an unrestricted draw  in the U.S. Treasury.  </p><p>So, the first thing to do is put those programs on budget, make them live  within a finite amount of money and serve the beneficiaries.  And then, we  can just move across the board, go to the farm programs, go to annual  spending.  There's lots of waste in there.  And really, get serious about  running these programs effectively.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, you need courage to be able to come out during an election  year, and say, we're cutting back on your Social Security checks and your  pension.  But, clearly, you've got to go where money is.  And then, there  is this global market worrying over trade and tariffs, Senator Ron Johnson  told me on Sunday that the president should keep the pressure on China  since they pose more than just an economic threat, but is tariffs the  answer?  Here's what he said, Doug, listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)  </p><p>SEN. RON JOHNSON (R), WISCONSIN:  Let's face it, China has been stealing  hundreds of billions of dollars-worth of our industrial secrets, as well as  our military secrets, and that is really, I think, the biggest threat that  we face in terms of our relationship with China.  </p><p>I think the good news is because of public awareness, the gap between those  on offense and those of us on defense, is quite honestly narrowing.  And  hopefully, if we have a unified rest of the world when it comes to trade  and our dealings with China, we'll discipline them to begin -- you know,  really, adhering to norms of the rest of the world trading system.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your take, Doug, is China going to adhere to the norms -- the  rules of the world on the global basis or not?  </p><p>EAKEN:  Not without a lot of pressure.  I think China really does not  understand how far it is out of line with acceptable behavior.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're right.  </p><p>EAKEN:  I think the important phrase there with Senator Johnson was a  \"unified world,\" I don't think we have that.  The administration has  correctly identified China as problem, has been very aggressive in a  bilateral fashion and trying to get China to change this behavior, that's  been utterly unsuccessful.  I think it will be unsuccessful but acting  alone.  The key is to get a multilateral approach where all of our key  allies in Europe, and in Japan, and in other parts of the world agree to  enforce better discipline on China.  That's not happening right now, that's  the missing piece in this strategy.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I wonder if as he continues to do trade deals and confirms  these deals with others, like a deal with E.U., you know, like when the new  president in Mexico gets into place where you as actually see the commerce  back-and-forth from the new USMCA deal, will that bring these countries  together in a unified front against China?  </p><p>EAKEN:  It may, but it's a big if.  They are the -- negotiated USMCA has a  provision that says: \"Anyone who signs this cannot negotiate a free trade  agreement with nonmarket economy,\" aimed directly at China.  So, that makes  sense.  If you can get to those deals in place, and I'll point out, Canada  and Mexico haven't signed that deal yet, there's been a lot of talk about  it, but there's no signature, and it still -- we have to go through  Congress as well.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  </p><p>EAKEN:  Going -- getting a deal with Europe takes time.  So, all of these  things are very time-consuming, and quite frankly, China has a much greater  capacity, just wait us out.  President Xi is a president for life, their  capacity to directly intervene in the economy is enormous.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>EAKEN:  And so, I worry about the time tables here, and I worry about  whether there's enough pressure from enough countries to get things moving  quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we'll be watching that.  Doug, it's always a pleasure to  see you, thanks so much.  </p><p>EAKEN:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Douglas Holtz-Eaken joining us there.  Stay with Fox Business  for a special midterm election coverage, it begins on November 6, at 7:00  p.m. Eastern, we are all hands-on deck.  And then the next morning,  MORNINGS WITH MARIA will start an hour early at 5:00 a.m. Eastern, that's  on November 7th.  So, join us, as we bring you all the results from  midterms.</p><p>First, though, Elon Musk is firing back.  Why the Tesla CEO says 20- million-dollar fine against this his company was, well, it was worth,  straight ahead.  Then Brazil's next president; Stuart Varney weighs in on  the country's elections back in a moment right here.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Check out Tesla shares up this morning as CEO  Elon Musk brushes off worries about an investigation into the infamous  funding secure tweet.  Susan Li is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details there.  Good morning, Susan.  </p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK REPORTER:  Good morning, Maria.  That is  right, the Tesla's CEO, well, still CEO, Elon Musk, says it was worth it,  the $20 million in fines that he had to pay and Tesla had to pay for those  tweets back in August, when he said funding was secured, he was taking the  company private and that was at $420.  </p><p>Well, don't forget, the SEC, of course, a part of that settlement says that  Elon Musk, if he's going to tweet about Tesla, he has to go through the  company's communications channels, so not sure if he's adhering to those  procedures but he did say late on Friday after that tweet, less than an  hour later, he says he's going to take a few days off the Twittersphere.</p><p>OK.  Let's also talk about Wal-Mart.  And I guess in this case, what Amazon  can do, Wal-Mart will try to do better if they can, so they are launching  their own cashier-less stores.  They're testing something called Sam's Club  Now, that will open in Dallas next week.  They told us about this back in  June, and it's pretty much similar to what Amazon Go is doing.  So, they're  employing mobile checkout, camera-like systems for inventory management,  and I guess, they're still playing catchup to Amazon at this point.  Back  to you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Susan, thank you.  We are watching markets today.   We'll be watching you with a big rally expected at the opening of trading.   Meanwhile, Brazil's next president, big story, conservative candidate Jair  Bolsonaro is claiming victory this morning in his country's election.   Joining us now is the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney.  Good  morning to you, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  Look, I  don't think that the election of Jair Bolsonaro is going to have that much  effect on our daily lives in America or our economy or our market, but it  really is another marker on an extraordinarily populist trend.  I think it  started with Brexit, it continued with the election of Donald Trump in  November 2016, then it's the five-star movement in Italy, a populist  movement, which runs Italy, and which may well break up the European Union.   And now, Brazil, it's the largest country in Latin America, 210 million  Brazilians, the largest economy in Latin America, and it's going to be run  by a conservative.  This is quite something.  So, it's in with the new,  which seems to be populism, and out with the old.  I'm sure you've reported  it, Maria, but Angela Merkel, she's stepping down as the leader of her  party, and will try to finish out her term as Chancellor of Germany.  But  whether she makes that or not is another story.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>VARNEY:  She is out, and the populists in Brazil, Italy, America, elsewhere  are in.  What a trend.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I think -- I think it's also important to note that look what  the alternative was, Stu, if you didn't vote in Brazil for Bolsonaro, you  were voting for a socialist.  So, once again, socialism was tested here.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We're looking at socialism sort of testing the waters across  the world.  People are not having it.</p><p>VARNEY:  I wonder if it has an implication for our elections in eight days  here.  After all, the Democrats could be characterized as moving rapidly  towards socialism, and President Trump, you could characterize him as a  populist, if you like.  That's the contest that we face in eight days'  time.  I just wonder if these worldwide trends will play out here, all over  again.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It really seems like it is taking a hold across the  world.  In people -- in places you didn't expect like Italy, as you  mentioned.  </p><p>VARNEY:  Oh, yes.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, I know you're going to have a lot more in 10 minutes.  We  will see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour  9:00 a.m. Eastern.  Do not miss Stuart after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  </p><p>But first, there's this, hockey's new bet, details on the partnership  between the New Jersey Devils and sports book operator William Hill.  Back  in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, the New Jersey Devils getting into the legal  gambling business.  The NHL team making a multi-year deal with William  Hill, to provide legalized gambling inside the Prudential Center, where  they play.  Joining us now is the CEO of William Hill U.S., Joe Asher.   Joe, great to see you this morning, thanks so much for being here.</p><p>JOE ASHER, CEO, WILLIAM HILL U.S.:  Hey, good morning.  Nice to be with  you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, congratulations.!  This has been a long-term investment for  William Hill, right?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, it is.  You know, we've been working towards the day when  sports betting would become legal outside Nevada, and of course, that day  came about five months ago when the Supreme Court overturned the federal  law that had prevented that.  And we are going to New Jersey pretty shortly  thereafter, and recently announced the deal with the Devils and we're  excited about it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How much -- what kind of revenue are you talking about?  What  are you expecting in terms of the revenue that this will bring in?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, across the country, I mean, you're looking at a market that  the estimates are somewhere between 150 to $400 billion in the amount  waged; figured about five or six percent that comes into revenue.  So, it's  a substantial market across the country, but of course, that's going to  develop over a period of years, as states begin to legalize sports betting  at the state level.  You know, the Supreme Court basically turned the issue  back to the states.  States like Delaware, NEW Jersey, Mississippi, West  Virginia got going quickly, and others are in the process, and it will  develop over the next few years.</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  Joe, Mitch Roschelle, good morning.  Is the plan to expand  across multiple states or is the plan in New Jersey to expand in the State  of New Jersey?</p><p>ASHER:  Well, our plan, of course, is to do both, Mitch.  We've opened  already at about a dozen locations in Mississippi, one in West Virginia.   We're gearing up to get going in the not too distant future in Pennsylvania  and in Rhode Island.  And in New Jersey, we've just opened up our third  retail location, but also in New Jersey, you can bet online by just  downloading the app in the App Store, and you can bet from anywhere within  the state, but you do have to be present within the State of New Jersey in  that case to place your bets.  You know, out here in Nevada, you've been  able to bet on sports for decades, and you go into a casino, you sign up  for your mobile account here in the State of Nevada and then you can bet  anywhere within the state.  Right now, we do about two-thirds of our  business on mobile.</p><p>CARTER:  So, you're just betting on the -- you know, you're at -- you're at  a Devils game, you're just betting on that game or can you bet on all  sports?  Can you tell me a little bit about what it's like for them?</p><p>ASHER:  Sure, you can bet -- you can bet on all sports within the -- within  the State of New Jersey.  Just like, you know, like I was at the Golden  Knights game here in Las Vegas last night, really, really exciting game and  they do a great job there, but not only were people betting on the Golden  Knights game, they're betting on other hockey games that are going on.  And  now, of course, this is a busy time in the sporting calendar, last night,  you had the last game of the World Series, basketball is getting going,  we're in the middle of football season.  So, there's a lot of -- there's a  lot going on in the sporting calendar, which makes it a busy time of the  year for us.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Joe, it's Dagen McDowell, name a sport that people might be  surprised that people bet on so much.  Like -- go ahead.</p><p>ASHER:  No, I was going to say one of -- one of the big -- so, right now,  we do about -- here in Nevada, we do about 37 percent of our business on  what we call \"in-play sports,\" or betting after the game has started.  The  number one sport for in-play by far is Major League Baseball, because the  pace of the game is so conducive to it.  But also, tennis is a -- is a big  game that -- or a big sport for in-play wagering.</p><p>LEE:  I would not expect tennis.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  But people -- but again, it's -- because it's only two  players, and/or in singles as two players, you can see if somebody looks  fatigued.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Has gotten inside of their own head.  And so, that's when you  place in in-play bet maybe.</p><p>ASHER:  Oh, you know, it's got --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  (INAUDIBLE) from experience.</p><p>ASHER:  Yes, you know, look, it allows you to take a bigger game then chop  it down into a much shorter interval.  So, for instance, in baseball,  people like to bet will there be run scored in the next inning, yes or no.   There's an actual break period in between innings, and we'll have people  bet substantial sums of moment just on the next inning.  You're taking a  three-hour game, you're chopping it down to a 20-minute game.  Tennis, same  sort of thing, people will bet set by set or game by game, and you're  taking a longer event and chopping it down into a much shorter event so  people can make their bet, know whether they won or loss in a short period  of time. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Very cool.  Joe, great to have you, thanks so much.  We'll be  watching.</p><p>ASHER:  All right.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joe Asher, joining us there.  Coming up, final thoughts from  this all-star panel.  Stay with us.  Back in moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lee  Carter.</p><p>CARTER:  I am looking forward to seeing how this week plays out in polling  coming out to the midterms.  I think that this week could surprise us all,  and I think it's going to be a week that's going to lean Republican.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  All right.</p><p>CARTER:  They do.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Eight days away from the Midterms.  Mitch?</p><p>ROSCHELLE:  The Fed's preferred inflation measure, PCE, just came out, it's  still flat at two percent which is the Fed's target.  So, let's see if the  Fed holds off and doesn't continue to raise rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Why do we need a rate hike in December, Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  Exactly. </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Jon Hilsenrath has co-wrote an article in the Wall Street  Journal that starts at \"What If That Was as Good as It Gets In Terms of the  Economy?\"  Well, we're looking at 3.1 percent wage growth coming up this  Friday for last month, that would be the best in 9-1/2 years.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Which is good stuff.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Have a great day, everybody.  Go seize the day!   Dagen McDowell, Mitch Roschelle, Lee Carter, great to see you.  Let's get  right to Stuart.  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins right now.  Stuart, take it  away.</p><p>VARNEY:  Good morning, Maria.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

They are increasingly hated by all sides of the political spectrum, and so the only question now is how severe the backlash will be, not whether it will happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Left hate the size and profits of Big Tech,\u00a0 want it to pay more in tax, are upset at its employment practices, and are incensed at what they believe, with limited evidence, was its role in Donald Trump's victory. The Right resent how Twitter is dominated by an elite that is hostile to capitalism, conservatism and Brexit, are angry at the technology establishment's Left-wing politics, and hate the industry's cultural conformity. Libertarians, who ordinarily have great respect for entrepreneurs,\u00a0 are terrified about the abolition of privacy, the rise of a surveillance society, and the fact that data could easily fall into the wrong, authoritarian hands; hawks are concerned that mass automation means the West is exposing itself to devastating Russian or Chinese cyber-attacks.</p><p>In other words, nobody is happy, except for, by and large, consumers, who continue to lap it all up, buying from Amazon or signing up to Netflix in droves. \u00a0But as Sadiq Khan's attack on Uber reminds us, consumers are never a powerful enough constituency when all other groups want to target an industry. We are about to witness an avalanche of crude antitrust attacks, based on obsolete economic ideas, much higher taxes, often on revenues rather than profits, an economically stupid approach, and a generalised legislative onslaught. Some of this will help; but much will do more harm than good, and merely slow innovation. The Brussels-led assault on Microsoft in the 2000s proved the uselessness of this approach: regulators chased the wrong issues, not realising that another new technology - the internet - would make Microsoft's power over the desktop irrelevant.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}We need to create a real free-market in data: we need more and better capitalism, not less. We must empower individuals, not bureaucrats, by changing the rules of the game</p><p>There is a better way, and that is to apply intelligent centre-Right thinking to reforming tech. We need to create a real free-market in data: we need more and better capitalism, not less. We must empower individuals, not bureaucrats, by changing the rules of the game. History should be our guide.</p><p>Progress through the ages has come from extending, refining and spreading property rights to as many people as possible. Instead of tribal chiefs, Kings, the Church or a few noble families owning all of the land, the dispersion of property over the centuries helped create the conditions for an explosion in economic growth, liberalism and democracy.</p><p>As ideas became more important, we extended ownership to intellectual property, incentivising inventions and creativity. We are now at another turning point: we live in a data society and yet haven't started to think about who should own it. Should information about people - what they eat, where they drive, how they vote - be treated as \"unowned\", in what John Locke described as the state of nature, ready to be homesteaded by the big tech firms in return for better services or \"free\" apps? Or is such an approach an outrage akin to the imperialism of yore, when Westerners seized resources that should have been owned by local populations, and employed them as a consolation prize?</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica | The story so far</p><p>If the answer is the latter, the good news is that economists are working on solutions. Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik of the University of Chicago, for example, want to make it easier for new social networks to be created, and for users to switch, by changing the ownership of the data and social relationships contained in people's accounts. In the early days of the mobile phone, numbers were owned by providers, and it was hard for customers to shift to a competitor. They would have to inform all of their contacts of their new number, cumbersome for individuals and lethal for businesses.</p><p>All of this changed with mobile phone portability, when consumers were given ownership of their numbers.

They are increasingly hated by all sides of the political spectrum, and so the only question now is how severe the backlash will be, not whether it will happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Left hate the size and profits of Big Tech, want it to pay more in tax, are upset at its employment practices, and are incensed at what they believe, with limited evidence, was its role in Donald Trump's victory. The Right resent how Twitter is dominated by an elite that is hostile to capitalism, conservatism and Brexit, are angry at the technology establishment's Left-wing politics, and hate the industry's cultural conformity. Libertarians, who ordinarily have great respect for entrepreneurs, are terrified about the abolition of privacy, the rise of a surveillance society, and the fact that data could easily fall into the wrong, authoritarian hands; hawks are concerned that mass automation means the West is exposing itself to devastating Russian or Chinese cyber-attacks.</p><p>In other words, nobody is happy, except for, by and large, consumers, who continue to lap it all up, buying from Amazon or signing up to Netflix in droves.  But as Sadiq Khan's attack on Uber reminds us, consumers are never a powerful enough constituency when all other groups want to target an industry. We are about to witness an avalanche of crude antitrust attacks, based on obsolete economic ideas, much higher taxes, often on revenues rather than profits, an economically stupid approach, and a generalised legislative onslaught. Some of this will help; but much will do more harm than good, and merely slow innovation. The Brussels-led assault on Microsoft in the 2000s proved the uselessness of this approach: regulators chased the wrong issues, not realising that another new technology - the internet - would make Microsoft's power over the desktop irrelevant.</p><p>.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:0}.html-embed.component .quote.component .component-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source, .quote__author {white-space: normal;}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embed.component .quote.component .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12px;padding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embed.component .quote.component{margin-left:-82.33px}}We need to create a real free-market in data: we need more and better capitalism, not less. We must empower individuals, not bureaucrats, by changing the rules of the game</p><p>There is a better way, and that is to apply intelligent centre-Right thinking to reforming tech. We need to create a real free-market in data: we need more and better capitalism, not less. We must empower individuals, not bureaucrats, by changing the rules of the game. History should be our guide.</p><p>Progress through the ages has come from extending, refining and spreading property rights to as many people as possible. Instead of tribal chiefs, Kings, the Church or a few noble families owning all of the land, the dispersion of property over the centuries helped create the conditions for an explosion in economic growth, liberalism and democracy.</p><p>As ideas became more important, we extended ownership to intellectual property, incentivising inventions and creativity. We are now at another turning point: we live in a data society and yet haven't started to think about who should own it. Should information about people - what they eat, where they drive, how they vote - be treated as \"unowned\", in what John Locke described as the state of nature, ready to be homesteaded by the big tech firms in return for better services or \"free\" apps? Or is such an approach an outrage akin to the imperialism of yore, when Westerners seized resources that should have been owned by local populations, and employed them as a consolation prize?</p><p>Facebook and Cambridge Analytica | The story so far</p><p>If the answer is the latter, the good news is that economists are working on solutions. Luigi Zingales and Guy Rolnik of the University of Chicago, for example, want to make it easier for new social networks to be created, and for users to switch, by changing the ownership of the data and social relationships contained in people's accounts. In the early days of the mobile phone, numbers were owned by providers, and it was hard for customers to shift to a competitor. They would have to inform all of their contacts of their new number, cumbersome for individuals and lethal for businesses.</p><p>All of this changed with mobile phone portability, when consumers were given ownership of their numbers. Our notion of property rights was upgraded: our mobile number is now part of our identity. Zingales and Rolnilk similarly want to reallocate the ownership of people's \"social graph\" - our networks and data, including pictures - from Facebook, Twitter or Microsoft's LinkedIn to the individual user.

The Alliance for Interactive, Season...</p><p>With Daniel Lippman   ANNALS OF HALLOWEEN LOBBYING: A coalition of haunted house operators has hired Hogan Lovells to convince Congress to change the Paycheck Protection Program so their industry can take advantage of it. The Alliance for Interactive, Seasonal, and Location-based Entertainment sent letters to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , House Speaker  Nancy Pelosi , House Minority Leader  Kevin McCarthy , Senate Majority Leader  Mitch McConnell , Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and more than two dozen other lawmakers making the case that the \u201cindustry has been unable to benefit from PPP in any meaningful way\u201d and asking for changes.   \u2014 The Paycheck Protection Program\u2019s rules allow seasonal employers the option to use any 12-week period between May 1, 2019, and Sept. 15, 2019, when determining the maximum loan amounts for which they\u2019re eligible. That\u2019s a problem for haunted houses because their business doesn\u2019t pick up until the fall. \u201cI don\u2019t know if folks imagined that the Covid crisis would extend this long\u201d when the rules were written, said Aaron Cutler , one of the lobbyists representing the coalition. The lobbyists are pushing to get the changes included in any extension of the loan program and might expand the effort to include holiday-season businesses as well.   FORMER MCCONNELL AIDE STARTS HIS OWN FIRM: Brian Forest , a former chief speechwriter for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , has started his own communications firm, Arboreal Communications . (\u201cArboreal\u201d is a nod to his last name.) He\u2019ll consult on messaging and write for trade groups, nonprofits and companies. Forest was previously the National Association of Manufacturers \u2019 director of strategic messaging and before that spent several years on the Hill working for McConnell as well as former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.). The firm is a one-man shop for now but Forest said he\u2019s looking to hire.   Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips [email protected] . Twitter: @theodoricmeyer .     A message from Facebook:     Facebook launches new Voting Information Center. Facebook is building the largest voter information effort in US history, starting with the new Voting Information Center, where you can find the latest resources about voting in the 2020 election. Our goal is to help register 4 million voters. Explore our new Voting Information Center now.      ADMINISTRATION INDICATES U.S. COMPANIES CAN KEEP USING WECHAT IN CHINA: \u201cThe Trump administration is signaling that U.S. companies can continue to use the WeChat messaging app in China, according to several people familiar with the matter, two weeks after President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. ban on the Chinese-owned service,\u201d Bloomberg News \u2019 Jennifer Jacobs , Shelly Banjo , Saleha Mohsin , Jenny Leonard and Naomi Nix report.   \u2014 \u201cThe administration is still working through the technical implications of how to enforce such a partial ban on the app, which is owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. , one of China\u2019s biggest companies. A key question is whether the White House would allow Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. \u2019s Google to carry the app in its global app stores outside of the U.S., according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The intention is to prohibit any downloads or updates of the WeChat app in U.S. app stores, two of the people said. U.S. companies with China operations such as Starbucks Corp. could still advertise and process transactions with Chinese consumers via the app, they said.\u201d   WHO KAMALA HARRIS KNOWS IN SILICON VALLEY: The New York Times \u2019 Daisuke Wakabayashi , Stephanie Saul and Ken Vogel take a closer look at Kamala Harris \u2019 relationship with Silicon Valley , including her personal ties to the industry. \u201c Lartease Tiffith left his position as a senior counsel in Ms. Harris\u2019s Senate office in late 2018 and became an in-house lobbyist for Amazon , focusing on privacy and security issues. Rebecca Prozan , who ran Ms. Harris\u2019s first campaign for district attorney in San Francisco, is a top government affairs official for Google in California. Tony West , Ms. Harris\u2019s brother-in-law and a former Justice Department official, is the chief legal officer for Uber .\u201d   \u2014  \u201c\u2018There are familial connections and a level of mutual affection with Silicon Valley that goes above and beyond the fact that she is a San Francisco politician,\u2019 said Jeff Hauser , executive director of the Revolving Door Project , a left-leaning watchdog group that has criticized Ms. Harris\u2019s ties to Big Tech and other corporate interests.\u201d (PI noted Tiffith\u2019s role at Amazon last week in a roundup of former Harris aides on K Street.)   ZUCKERBERG TESTIFIED BEFORE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: Mark Zuckerberg , Facebook \u2019s chief executive, \u201c testified this week at a Federal Trade Commission investigative hearing as part of the agency\u2019s antitrust investigation into the social network, according to three people familiar with the case,\u201d POLITICO \u2019s Leah Nylen and Betsy Woodruff Swan report. \u201cFTC staff often interview witnesses under oath as part of their investigations in a process similar to a deposition and nearly always in cases they expect to lead to a lawsuit.\u201d   \u2014 \u201cThe people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the probe, said the step doesn\u2019t necessarily signal that the agency will ultimately pursue an antitrust lawsuit. Nevertheless, the testimony, conducted under oath and remotely over the course of two days this week, could be used to help the FTC and state attorneys general build a case against the social network.\u201d    REGIONAL AIRLINES STILL WAITING ON CORONAVIRUS RELIEF: \u201cThe Treasury Department's process for getting emergency loans out to small air carriers and others has been so shambolic that many companies are struggling to stay afloat as they await relief , as others go out of business,\u201d POLITICO \u2019s Tanya Snyder reports. \u201cAfter initially applying for a loan program for air carriers and other eligible businesses , in July \u2014 more than three months after many companies had applied for relief \u2014 aviation applicants were informed that they needed first to apply to the Main Street lending program, a general loan fund aimed at providing support for small and mid-sized businesses.\u201d   \u2014 \"Since the CARES Act was signed into law, three regional airlines have ceased operation \u2014 Compass Airlines , Trans States Airlines and RavnAir Group \u2014 and ExpressJet is winding down by the end of the year. Other small air carriers and providers are still waiting, hemorrhaging money and trying to survive.\u201d    Jobs Report    \u2014 Boeing is reshuffling its communications team, tapping Gordon Johndroe , a former White House spokesperson in President George W. Bush \u2019s administration, as vice president of global media and public affairs. Bradley Akubuiro is now the company\u2019s chief spokesperson and senior director of global media relations and Betsy Andres Stewart is senior director of global public affairs communications.   \u2014 The financial technology company Plaid has hired Meredith Fuchs to lead its legal and risk teams, per POLITICO \u2019s Morning Tech. She was previously Capital One \u2019s senior vice president and chief counsel for regulatory advisory.

Prebid is mostly made up of sell-side ad-tech companies and publishers, so adding a buy-side member can help guide the design and implementation of new products, said Prebid chair Tom Kershaw.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cIf Havas can help us get to something that\u2019s real and actionable that a buyer can really use easily, that\u2019d be a huge gain for the industry,\u201d said Kershaw, who is also chief technology officer at Magnite, a supply-side platform.\u00a0</p><p>Prebid has bolstered its ranks lately, as independent ad-tech and publishers look to stay competitive with walled gardens. Index Exchange, an SSP, joined the group in July, and The Trade Desk became the first demand-side platform to join the group last November.\u00a0</p><p>There are multiple product management committees (PMC) within Prebid that focus on building standards in specific areas such as mobile, video and identity, which is a new group within Prebid that\u2019s developing ways to implement alternatives to third-party cookies.\u00a0</p><p>Buyers will also have their own PMC to discuss and work on their own initiatives, which can ultimately be brought to the Prebid board for further support and development. Andrew Goode, evp, head of biddable media at Havas North America, said two main focuses will be around standardizing transparency and identity.\u00a0</p><p>Goode said there\u2019s a loss of granularity as information gets passed along the digital advertising supply chain, making it hard for marketers to track the effectiveness of campaigns, so joining Prebid can help start a conversation to resolve that.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need an ID that can pass all the way through,\u201d Goode said. \u201cHow do we make sure that there is a clear tunnel, or a clear view from advertiser to publisher?\u201d</p><p>Last year, Havas Media Group slashed the number of supply-side platforms it worked with down to seven for failing to provide the required levels of transparency.</p><p>Havas joining Prebid doesn\u2019t mean the agency will direct more spend through the group\u2019s header bidding tool and away from Google and Amazon\u2019s products. Goode said it\u2019s important to maintain an \u201cagnostic\u201d approach.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re looking for the best, most meaningful routes to market, wherever they might be,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more a question of, \u2018How do we raise the standards across the board, rather than favoring one over the other?'\u201d</p><p>There is increasing collaboration within the industry to build new standards as both regulators and Big Tech make it harder to track people online and ultimately serve targeted ads.\u00a0</p><p>The Trade Desk is in the process of building an open-source ID to replace third-party cookies. Meanwhile, six major trade bodies and five major brands are among a host of stakeholders in the The Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media, a new group looking to maintain targeted advertising.</p><p>Goode hopes other holding companies join Prebid to help push the digital ad industry forward in a serious time of change.</p><p>\u201cGiven that transparency and identity are two such big topics at the moment\u2014there are decisions being made and there are ideas being spread\u2014I think it\u2019d be a missed opportunity if other holding companies are not participating and joining the conversation,\u201d he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1189732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60M8-DXW1-DYRK-H00Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"554\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 17, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

An April press release[3] had established an Orwellian 'duty of care,' which requires 'companies to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services.' </p><p>Forbes wrote that Digital media and culture secretary Nicky Morgan is introducing measures based on a government white paper[4] launched in April last year. The 'duty of care' concept is mentioned in its pages[5] no less than 53 times.This 'Online Harms White Paper[6],' which was first released last April, also includes references to a similar German regulation 'Network Enforcement Act ('NetzDG'),' which can fine social media companies for up to 50 million Euros for failing to remove hate speech in compliance with German laws.One revealing admission made by this government document is that it describes 'online hate' as being targeted at groups 'including ethnic minorities and women.'It specifically cited the growing use of artificial intelligence ('AI') in moderating platforms, which seems to reflect a pattern with the British government. One such project, 'HateLab,'[7] funded by the Obama-era government and United Kingdom, uses artificial intelligence to scan users' social media for 'grossly offensive' anti-PC speech and attempted to predict when people will commit 'hate crime[s].' In short, the AI was meant to scan social media history for 'pre-crime' purposes.Morgan, quoted by Forbes, said she espoused \"We will give the regulator the powers it needs to lead the fight for an internet that remains vibrant and open but with the protections, accountability and transparency people deserve.\"The 'Internet Association' was critical of the legislation, and represents the interests of Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Amazon and Google. It was cited by PCMag[8] as warning that these new regulations could 'hurt the British tech sector, worsen the quality of internet services for ordinary consumers, undermine privacy, and produce a chilling effect on freedom of speech.\"Free speech advocates may feel betrayed by groups they considered to be allies. The more conservative Tory Party under prime minister Boris Johnson, which helped bring about Brexit, said, 'We will legislate to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online \u2014 protecting children from online abuse and harms, protecting the most vulnerable from accessing harmful content, and ensuring there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online,' according to the Jerusalem Post[9].Even the Northern Irish DUP's Carla Lockhart has condemned[10] 'anonymous accounts.' She commented: 'For too long the world of social media has been like an online Wild West, with no regard for what little rules exist.' She remarked that 'A token slap on the wrist will not be enough to protect users,' and said that going forward, 'it is vital that regulators are empowered with the ability to impose serious fines and penalties on social media companies.\"Perhaps American tech companies should honor their home country, and acknowledge that an internet of the 'Wild West' is ultimately what is best for liberty.

An April press release[3] had established an Orwellian 'duty of care,' which requires 'companies to take reasonable steps to keep their users safe and tackle illegal and harmful activity on their services.' </p><p>Forbes wrote that Digital media and culture secretary Nicky Morgan is introducing measures based on a government white paper[4] launched in April last year. The 'duty of care' concept is mentioned in its pages[5] no less than 53 times.This 'Online Harms White Paper[6],' which was first released last April, also includes references to a similar German regulation 'Network Enforcement Act ('NetzDG'),' which can fine social media companies for up to 50 million Euros for failing to remove hate speech in compliance with German laws.One revealing admission made by this government document is that it describes 'online hate' as being targeted at groups 'including ethnic minorities and women.'It specifically cited the growing use of artificial intelligence ('AI') in moderating platforms, which seems to reflect a pattern with the British government. One such project, 'HateLab,'[7] funded by the Obama-era government and United Kingdom, uses artificial intelligence to scan users' social media for 'grossly offensive' anti-PC speech and attempted to predict when people will commit 'hate crime[s].' In short, the AI was meant to scan social media history for 'pre-crime' purposes.Morgan, quoted by Forbes, said she espoused \"We will give the regulator the powers it needs to lead the fight for an internet that remains vibrant and open but with the protections, accountability and transparency people deserve.\"The 'Internet Association' was critical of the legislation, and represents the interests of Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, Amazon and Google. It was cited by PCMag[8] as warning that these new regulations could 'hurt the British tech sector, worsen the quality of internet services for ordinary consumers, undermine privacy, and produce a chilling effect on freedom of speech.\"Free speech advocates may feel betrayed by groups they considered to be allies. The more conservative Tory Party under prime minister Boris Johnson, which helped bring about Brexit, said, 'We will legislate to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online   protecting children from online abuse and harms, protecting the most vulnerable from accessing harmful content, and ensuring there is no safe space for terrorists to hide online,' according to the Jerusalem Post[9].Even the Northern Irish DUP's Carla Lockhart has condemned[10] 'anonymous accounts.' She commented: 'For too long the world of social media has been like an online Wild West, with no regard for what little rules exist.' She remarked that 'A token slap on the wrist will not be enough to protect users,' and said that going forward, 'it is vital that regulators are empowered with the ability to impose serious fines and penalties on social media companies.\"Perhaps American tech companies should honor their home country, and acknowledge that an internet of the 'Wild West' is ultimately what is best for liberty.

After swapping the crown between themselves, Apple pulled away. Today it is worth more than two and a half times Exxon, whose capitalisation has changed little since 2011. Nor is it alone. The Google-owning Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are all valued at least twice the price of the energy company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumer technology has not only changed lives, it has powered the share portfolios of millions of investors. But, given the regulatory and political storms that have blown up in the past three weeks, is Wall Street's love affair with the technology titans drawing to a close? The S&amp;P 500 index of leading US shares has risen in value by two thirds over the past five years, powered by large technology companies. The FTSE 100 has mustered a 13 per cent gain over the same period.</p><p>Despite fears of a bubble, \"big tech\" has been a runaway success that top investors are loath to bet against. The fund managers who traded the steady earnings and generous dividends of Exxon and its old-world peers for technology shares will be forever grateful. Even in the last quarter of 2017, when many might have thought that stocks had become too expensive, the canny veteran Warren Buffett increased his holding in Apple by 24 per cent.</p><p>But something is changing again. Big tech is being forced to grow up. Confirmation on Wednesday that up to 87 million people may have had personal information taken from Facebook - and that data on most of its two billion users could have been improperly accessed - suggests that the events of recent weeks are only the beginning.</p><p>Since it emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the data firm, had gathered millions of Facebook profiles to influence voter choice, shares in Facebook have dropped by 14 per cent, while Alphabet is 9 per cent lower, Amazon is down 8 per cent and Apple is 3 per cent off. So much for the so-called FAANGs: angry investors' teeth marks are showing on the big beasts of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google. The worst-performing tech stock, though - and President Trump's favourite method of communication - has been Twitter, whose shares have tumbled by 20 per cent.</p><p>Next week, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's chief executive, will be questioned twice, by committees of first the US Senate and then the House of Representatives. Apologies for mistakes are unlikely to head off a watershed for how those that profit from the exploitation of personal data protect customers.</p><p>Thus far, regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech has not equated to investor pain. An investigation into Googleby the European Commission - which fined the company \u00a32.2 billion last year for abusing its dominance of the search engine market - has not affected its share price performance. However, the biggest threat may come from within. From Standard Oil to AT&amp;T, the United States has not been afraid to take its dominant companies to task. In the White House, there is a president spoiling for a fight. Mr Trump has Amazon in his sights, tweeting on Monday: \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\"</p><p>Regulators are troubled by the size of these corporations and what that means for society, be it Amazon's impact on America's deserted shopping malls, or the vast wealth it has created for Jeff Bezos, its founder, enabling him to acquire The Washington Post.</p><p>Tech giants also face a fiscal threat. One solution gaining traction in Europe to raise more money from Big Tech is to tax sales in the locations where customers buy goods instead of trying to track profits across borders. Experienced technology investors think that what is happening is a necessary part of maturing for these relatively young firms.</p><p>\"Tech has become a part of everyday life,\" says Saul Klein, whose venture capital firm Local Globe has backed start-ups. \"This means we will continue to see amazing companies emerge, but it also means these companies will necessarily face more scrutiny, from markets, regulators and consumers alike.\"</p><p>Mr Klein thinks that Googleand Facebook have more to lose than Apple and Amazon if governments clamp down on how customer data is used. Yet he also points to strong investor appetite for new firms, such as Dropbox and Spotify. The latter, a Swedish music streaming service, had a strong start as a publicly listed company this week. Its shares dipped in first-day trading, but had opened at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 guide price set for the stock. Its $26 billion market value is not bad for a company that made a $461 million loss last year. Perhaps not everything investors have taken for granted about the tech world will change overnight.</p><p>Regulators ride in to call halt to 'days of Wild West'</p><p>According to Matt Hancock, \"the days of an unregulated Wild West are over\" (Callum Jones writes). The lawmen are riding into town and, for the culture secretary, their arrival is long overdue.</p><p>The marshalls and sheriffs in this case are governments and regulators; in their sights, a motley crew of social networks failing to take responsibility for illegal content, search engines promoting their own services in results and corporate heavyweights arranging \"sweetheart\" tax deals.</p><p>The likes of Facebook and Twitter may twitch at talk of legislative action, but the first shots have already been fired. In January Germany introduced laws aimed squarely at such companies. Social networks may now be fined up to (EURO)50 million if they persistently leave illegal posts, including hate speech, terrorist material and child sex abuse, online for longer than 24 hours after they have been reported.</p><p>Yet more worrying for the sharpshooters of Silicon Valley are the bigger guns aimed at their pockets. Googleis appealing against a (EURO)2.4 billion fine imposed by the European Commission last year for abusing the market dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping service. In 2016, Brussels ordered Apple to pay (EURO)13 billion in back taxes to Ireland over what it claimed was illegal state aid. Facebook has been fined (EURO)110 million for misleading officials over its acquisition of the Whatsapp messaging service. Now Washington is following suit, with politicians taking Facebook to task over its handling of millions of users' data and an irate President Trump lambasting Amazon.</p><p>Concern over greater regulation is said to have helped to persuade Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Paypal, to withdraw from the technology industry this year. Such foresight from an early backer of Facebook and Space X is being praised by some of his peers.</p><p>'Politicians are taking Facebook to task over its handling of data'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLONMike Myers, reviving his Dr Evil character, joined the lampooning of <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his presidential ambitions with anappearance on NBC's The Tonight Show, as technology companies from Facebook to Tesla reel under self-inflicted blows</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-136312251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S22-DDS1-DY9P-N1D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\"</p><p>Regulators are troubled by the size of these corporations and what that means for society, be it Amazon's impact on America's deserted shopping malls, or the vast wealth it has created for Jeff Bezos, its founder, enabling him to acquire The Washington Post.</p><p>Tech giants also face a fiscal threat. One solution gaining traction in Europe to raise more money from Big Tech is to tax sales in the locations where customers buy goods instead of trying to track profits across borders. Experienced technology investors think that what is happening is a necessary part of maturing for these relatively young firms.</p><p>\"Tech has become a part of everyday life,\" says Saul Klein, whose venture capital firm Local Globe has backed start-ups. \"This means we will continue to see amazing companies emerge, but it also means these companies will necessarily face more scrutiny, from markets, regulators and consumers alike.\"</p><p>Mr Klein thinks that Googleand Facebook have more to lose than Apple and Amazon if governments clamp down on how customer data is used. Yet he also points to strong investor appetite for new firms, such as Dropbox and Spotify. The latter, a Swedish music streaming service, had a strong start as a publicly listed company this week. Its shares dipped in first-day trading, but had opened at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 guide price set for the stock. Its $26 billion market value is not bad for a company that made a $461 million loss last year. Perhaps not everything investors have taken for granted about the tech world will change overnight.Regulators ride in to call halt to 'days of Wild West'According to Matt Hancock, \"the days of an unregulated Wild West are over\" (Callum Jones writes). The lawmen are riding into town and, for the culture secretary, their arrival is long overdue.</p><p>The marshalls and sheriffs in this case are governments and regulators; in their sights, a motley crew of social networks failing to take responsibility for illegal content, search engines promoting their own services in results and corporate heavyweights arranging \"sweetheart\" tax deals.</p><p>The likes of Facebook and Twitter may twitch at talk of legislative action, but the first shots have already been fired. In January Germany introduced laws aimed squarely at such companies. Social networks may now be fined up to (EURO)50 million if they persistently leave illegal posts, including hate speech, terrorist material and child sex abuse, online for longer than 24 hours after they have been reported.</p><p>Yet more worrying for the sharpshooters of Silicon Valley are the bigger guns aimed at their pockets. Googleis appealing against a (EURO)2.4 billion fine imposed by the European Commission last year for abusing the market dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping service. In 2016, Brussels ordered Apple to pay (EURO)13 billion in back taxes to Ireland over what it claimed was illegal state aid. Facebook has been fined (EURO)110 million for misleading officials over its acquisition of the Whatsapp messaging service. Now Washington is following suit, with politicians taking Facebook to task over its handling of millions of users' data and an irate President Trump lambasting Amazon.</p><p>Concern over greater regulation is said to have helped to persuade Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Paypal, to withdraw from the technology industry this year. Such foresight from an early backer of Facebook and Space X is being praised by some of his peers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-42956037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S22-6GC1-JCJY-G30R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

After swapping the crown between themselves, Apple pulled away. Today it is worth more than two and a half times Exxon, whose capitalisation has changed little since 2011. Nor is it alone. The Google-owning Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are all valued at least twice the price of the energy company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumer technology has not only changed lives, it has powered the share portfolios of millions of investors. But, given the regulatory and political storms that have blown up in the past three weeks, is Wall Street's love affair with the technology titans drawing to a close? The S&amp;P 500 index of leading US shares has risen in value by two thirds over the past five years, powered by large technology companies. The FTSE 100 has mustered a 13 per cent gain over the same period.</p><p>Despite fears of a bubble, \"big tech\" has been a runaway success that top investors are loath to bet against. The fund managers who traded the steady earnings and generous dividends of Exxon and its old-world peers for technology shares will be forever grateful. Even in the last quarter of 2017, when many might have thought that stocks had become too expensive, the canny veteran Warren Buffett increased his holding in Apple by 24 per cent.</p><p>But something is changing again. Big tech is being forced to grow up. Confirmation on Wednesday that up to 87 million people may have had personal information taken from Facebook - and that data on most of its two billion users could have been improperly accessed - suggests that the events of recent weeks are only the beginning.</p><p>Since it emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the data firm, had gathered millions of Facebook profiles to influence voter choice, shares in Facebook have dropped by 14 per cent, while Alphabet is 9 per cent lower, Amazon is down 8 per cent and Apple is 3 per cent off. So much for the so-called FAANGs: angry investors' teeth marks are showing on the big beasts of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google. The worst-performing tech stock, though - and President Trump's favourite method of communication - has been Twitter, whose shares have tumbled by 20 per cent.</p><p>Next week, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's chief executive, will be questioned twice, by committees of first the US Senate and then the House of Representatives. Apologies for mistakes are unlikely to head off a watershed for how those that profit from the exploitation of personal data protect customers.</p><p>Thus far, regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech has not equated to investor pain. An investigation into Googleby the European Commission - which fined the company \u00a32.2 billion last year for abusing its dominance of the search engine market - has not affected its share price performance. However, the biggest threat may come from within. From Standard Oil to AT&amp;T, the United States has not been afraid to take its dominant companies to task. In the White House, there is a president spoiling for a fight. Mr Trump has Amazon in his sights, tweeting on Monday: \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\"</p><p>Regulators are troubled by the size of these corporations and what that means for society, be it Amazon's impact on America's deserted shopping malls, or the vast wealth it has created for Jeff Bezos, its founder, enabling him to acquire The Washington Post.</p><p>Tech giants also face a fiscal threat. One solution gaining traction in Europe to raise more money from Big Tech is to tax sales in the locations where customers buy goods instead of trying to track profits across borders. Experienced technology investors think that what is happening is a necessary part of maturing for these relatively young firms.</p><p>\"Tech has become a part of everyday life,\" says Saul Klein, whose venture capital firm Local Globe has backed start-ups. \"This means we will continue to see amazing companies emerge, but it also means these companies will necessarily face more scrutiny, from markets, regulators and consumers alike.\"</p><p>Mr Klein thinks that Googleand Facebook have more to lose than Apple and Amazon if governments clamp down on how customer data is used. Yet he also points to strong investor appetite for new firms, such as Dropbox and Spotify. The latter, a Swedish music streaming service, had a strong start as a publicly listed company this week. Its shares dipped in first-day trading, but had opened at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 guide price set for the stock. Its $26 billion market value is not bad for a company that made a $461 million loss last year. Perhaps not everything investors have taken for granted about the tech world will change overnight.</p><p>Regulators ride in to call halt to 'days of Wild West' According to Matt Hancock, \"the days of an unregulated Wild West are over\" (Callum Jones writes). The lawmen are riding into town and, for the culture secretary, their arrival is long overdue.</p><p>The marshalls and sheriffs in this case are governments and regulators; in their sights, a motley crew of social networks failing to take responsibility for illegal content, search engines promoting their own services in results and corporate heavyweights arranging \"sweetheart\" tax deals.</p><p>The likes of Facebook and Twitter may twitch at talk of legislative action, but the first shots have already been fired. In January Germany introduced laws aimed squarely at such companies. Social networks may now be fined up to (EURO)50 million if they persistently leave illegal posts, including hate speech, terrorist material and child sex abuse, online for longer than 24 hours after they have been reported.</p><p>Yet more worrying for the sharpshooters of Silicon Valley are the bigger guns aimed at their pockets. Googleis appealing against a (EURO)2.4 billion fine imposed by the European Commission last year for abusing the market dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping service.

After swapping the crown between themselves, Apple pulled away. Today it is worth more than two and a half times Exxon, whose capitalisation has changed little since 2011. Nor is it alone. The Google-owning Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are all valued at least twice the price of the energy company.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consumer technology has not only changed lives, it has powered the share portfolios of millions of investors. But, given the regulatory and political storms that have blown up in the past three weeks, is Wall Street's love affair with the technology titans drawing to a close? The S&amp;P 500 index of leading US shares has risen in value by two thirds over the past five years, powered by large technology companies. The FTSE 100 has mustered a 13 per cent gain over the same period.</p><p>Despite fears of a bubble, \"big tech\" has been a runaway success that top investors are loath to bet against. The fund managers who traded the steady earnings and generous dividends of Exxon and its old-world peers for technology shares will be forever grateful. Even in the last quarter of 2017, when many might have thought that stocks had become too expensive, the canny veteran Warren Buffett increased his holding in Apple by 24 per cent.</p><p>But something is changing again. Big tech is being forced to grow up. Confirmation on Wednesday that up to 87 million people may have had personal information taken from Facebook - and that data on most of its two billion users could have been improperly accessed - suggests that the events of recent weeks are only the beginning.</p><p>Since it emerged that Cambridge Analytica, the data firm, had gathered millions of Facebook profiles to influence voter choice, shares in Facebook have dropped by 14 per cent, while Alphabet is 9 per cent lower, Amazon is down 8 per cent and Apple is 3 per cent off. So much for the so-called FAANGs: angry investors' teeth marks are showing on the big beasts of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet's Google. The worst-performing tech stock, though - and President Trump's favourite method of communication - has been Twitter, whose shares have tumbled by 20 per cent.</p><p>Next week, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Facebook's chief executive, will be questioned twice, by committees of first the US Senate and then the House of Representatives. Apologies for mistakes are unlikely to head off a watershed for how those that profit from the exploitation of personal data protect customers.</p><p>Thus far, regulatory scrutiny of Big Tech has not equated to investor pain. An investigation into Googleby the European Commission - which fined the company \u00a32.2 billion last year for abusing its dominance of the search engine market - has not affected its share price performance. However, the biggest threat may come from within. From Standard Oil to AT&amp;T, the United States has not been afraid to take its dominant companies to task. In the White House, there is a president spoiling for a fight. Mr Trump has Amazon in his sights, tweeting on Monday: \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\"</p><p>Regulators are troubled by the size of these corporations and what that means for society, be it Amazon's impact on America's deserted shopping malls, or the vast wealth it has created for Jeff Bezos, its founder, enabling him to acquire The Washington Post.</p><p>Tech giants also face a fiscal threat. One solution gaining traction in Europe to raise more money from Big Tech is to tax sales in the locations where customers buy goods instead of trying to track profits across borders. Experienced technology investors think that what is happening is a necessary part of maturing for these relatively young firms.</p><p>\"Tech has become a part of everyday life,\" says Saul Klein, whose venture capital firm Local Globe has backed start-ups. \"This means we will continue to see amazing companies emerge, but it also means these companies will necessarily face more scrutiny, from markets, regulators and consumers alike.\"</p><p>Mr Klein thinks that Googleand Facebook have more to lose than Apple and Amazon if governments clamp down on how customer data is used. Yet he also points to strong investor appetite for new firms, such as Dropbox and Spotify. The latter, a Swedish music streaming service, had a strong start as a publicly listed company this week. Its shares dipped in first-day trading, but had opened at $165.90, sharply higher than the $132 guide price set for the stock. Its $26 billion market value is not bad for a company that made a $461 million loss last year. Perhaps not everything investors have taken for granted about the tech world will change overnight.</p><p>Regulators ride in to call halt to 'days of Wild West' According to Matt Hancock, \"the days of an unregulated Wild West are over\" (Callum Jones writes). The lawmen are riding into town and, for the culture secretary, their arrival is long overdue.</p><p>The marshalls and sheriffs in this case are governments and regulators; in their sights, a motley crew of social networks failing to take responsibility for illegal content, search engines promoting their own services in results and corporate heavyweights arranging \"sweetheart\" tax deals.</p><p>The likes of Facebook and Twitter may twitch at talk of legislative action, but the first shots have already been fired. In January Germany introduced laws aimed squarely at such companies. Social networks may now be fined up to (EURO)50 million if they persistently leave illegal posts, including hate speech, terrorist material and child sex abuse, online for longer than 24 hours after they have been reported.</p><p>Yet more worrying for the sharpshooters of Silicon Valley are the bigger guns aimed at their pockets. Googleis appealing against a (EURO)2.4 billion fine imposed by the European Commission last year for abusing the market dominance of its search engine to promote its online shopping service. In 2016, Brussels ordered Apple to pay (EURO)13 billion in back taxes to Ireland over what it claimed was illegal state aid. Facebook has been fined (EURO)110 million for misleading officials over its acquisition of the Whatsapp messaging service. Now Washington is following suit, with politicians taking Facebook to task over its handling of millions of users' data and an irate President Trump lambasting Amazon.</p><p>Concern over greater regulation is said to have helped to persuade Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist and co-founder of Paypal, to withdraw from the technology industry this year. Such foresight from an early backer of Facebook and Space X is being praised by some of his peers.</p><p>'Politicians are taking Facebook to task over its handling of data'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>THE TONIGHT SHOW STARRING JIMMY FALLONMike Myers, reviving his Dr Evil character, joined the lampooning of <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and his presidential ambitions with anappearance on NBC's The Tonight Show, as technology companies from Facebook to Tesla reel under self-inflicted blows</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-136325327</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S22-DDS1-DY9P-N119-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1163\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 7, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>CC0002C1P</classCode><className>EXXON MOBIL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That includes massive investments, new online educational pathways, and a surge in economic opportunities. Nonetheless, there's growing evidence that shows a handful of gatekeepers are capturing control over key components of online content, communications, and commerce.</p><p><br/><br/>To ensure that companies are not creating monopolies to control core forms of interpersonal and public communication to maximize profits, US regulators have launched an investigation on four tech giants. The regulators will document competition issues and anti-competitive conduct of Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Google.Additionally, they'll assess whether the existing competition policies, antitrust laws, and enforcement levels are adequate to address the current issues.<br/>Why Are Regulators Accusing Amazon, Google, Apple, And Facebook Of Being Monopolies?<br/><br/>\u2022Amazon is currently the largest online store in the world, selling all sorts of consumer products. The store also runs a computing platform and produces TV shows/movies with Amazon Studios. Nonetheless, this tech giant has been accused of killing companies that use ideas similar to theirs.<br/><br/>\u2022As the most used search engine, Google has significant control over the flow of information. The company also owns businesses in the video (Youtube), Navigation (Waze and Google Maps) and mobile operating systems (Android), to list a few. As such, the regulators believe Google gives its businesses special treatment, leading to unfair competition.<br/><br/>\u2022Facebook has been blamed for spreading misleading information, helping to incite genocide, and violating user privacy. The company has over 2 billion users in all its platforms (Whatsapp, Facebook, and Instagram).<br/><br/>\u2022With over a trillion dollar market value, Apple has been accused of driving up prices in their stores. The company is currently in a class-action lawsuit for these allegations.<br/><br/>How Did Big Tech Become So Powerful?<br/>While the regulators have been busy with gambling platforms likeBetway , companies like Amazon and Google have been collecting a lot of information. These companies use that data to improve tools and services, allowing them to punish their competitors and keep growing. The network effect also plays a major role as most people join the network with the highest number of users.<br/><br/>Unlike betting companies such as Betway, most of these big tech companies acquire a huge amount of data by buying smaller companies. Experts believe that the Consumer Welfare Standard is to blame for this as the only consideration they put is to ensure the prices don't go up. However, big tech companies offer many free services for the standard to allow them to keep growing.<br/><br/>Under this view, a company like Google couldn't be stopped from acquiring Youtube as they don't compete. However, the standard fails to consider the driving force behind data-driven mergers and the company's access to the data or how it will help in maintaining its dominance.<br/><br/>As these big tech companies continue to grow, some scholars believe it's important to consider the non-price component of the competition such as privacy. That can be tricky to assess because such components are hard to determine, unlike price.RBN Media<br/><br/>RBN Media<br/><br/>46454565345<br/><br/>email us here MENAFN1706201900703196ID1098648507</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1098648507</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-Y6P1-JCNX-34FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 17, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
